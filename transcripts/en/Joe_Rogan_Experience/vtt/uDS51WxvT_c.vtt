WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:03.781
Wake up.

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:04.710
Should fear be alive?

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:05.071
What are you doing?

4
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.990
You Tweeten you'll let them bitches now,

5
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:07.824
right now.

6
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.640
Yeah.

7
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.473
Is that what you're doing?

8
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.403
Yeah.

9
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.010
No,

10
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.660
he can't talk him tweet at the same time.

11
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.070
Very few people can talk.

12
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.700
I can talk and type better than I can talk and text because it's something about

13
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.534
using phones.

14
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.030
I can sweet talk and drive.

15
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.241
Yeah.

16
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.140
None of it's good though.

17
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.270
Never noticed that and focus on one thing.

18
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:24.750
You fuck.

19
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.070
You're doing all three like a monkey.

20
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.440
I read this book where it said splitting your focuses is just,

21
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.520
when they say multitasking,

22
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.680
that's just that everyone cannot do that.

23
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.311
I mean,

24
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:33.040
no one can do it.

25
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.190
You,

26
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.070
your productivity goes down in each thing.

27
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.401
Yeah.

28
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.390
It definitely goes down.

29
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.860
I mean people can do it,

30
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.700
but you don't.

31
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.690
If it's things that don't require that much thinking or complexity,

32
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.321
you can do it,

33
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.370
but if it does,

34
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:45.000
you're fucked.

35
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
Yeah.

36
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.130
This is the Joe Rogan experience podcast and we're,

37
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.330
this is my new character,

38
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.340
like no bunny talks in real life.

39
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.900
I have a unique pattern of thinking,

40
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:01.150
you know,

41
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.771
this is like,

42
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:02.310
this is like,

43
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.510
I don't know if he's changed anyway through.

44
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:04.081
He's a bald guy.

45
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.550
It's a guy named Bob Scheer.

46
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.700
He calls himself Bosch here.

47
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.250
We'll have to talk about this on the podcast,

48
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.920
but he's fucking ridiculous and people believe it.

49
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:12.210
This guy is an alien.

50
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.350
They believe that he's,

51
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.910
he's channeling an alien.

52
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.870
That's how we told something like this.

53
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.360
So fucking stupid.

54
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.980
It's like emo Phillips.

55
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.750
He just talks terrible.

56
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.620
It gets me angry when people fall for really easy scams,

57
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.240
like really obvious scams,

58
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.410
everything.

59
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
But my friend,

60
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.000
uh,

61
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.230
his brother fell for it.

62
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.150
What are the Nigerian one?

63
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:36.451
No.

64
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:36.721
Okay,

65
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:36.960
let's,

66
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.793
we'll talk about that.

67
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.910
We saved up

68
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.300
if this podcast brought to you by audible.com if you go to audible.com forward

69
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.320
slash Joe,

70
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.560
they will give you a free 30 day membership and you get a free audio book.

71
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.170
Audible is a really awesome service.

72
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:55.381
A,

73
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.730
I'm a big fan myself.

74
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.900
I love audio books and I love their service especially they are on the cutting

75
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:01.440
edge.

76
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.990
And one of the reasons why I say this is because of their whisper sync.

77
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.090
It is the coolest fuck.

78
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.890
What does that whisper sync is?

79
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.710
It hooks up if you have one of those,

80
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.300
um,

81
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.610
uh,

82
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.590
Amazon kindles those kids.

83
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.510
Well you can,

84
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.960
you can get a kindle fire HD and you get it with the audible app.

85
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.090
And what it is is you read the audible,

86
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.480
audible,

87
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.530
audible book on it,

88
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.920
right?

89
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.240
You read rather the uh,

90
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.750
read the actual book and then it syncs to your smart phone.

91
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.210
So when you get in your car and your,

92
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.920
your will listen to an actor,

93
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.930
it's reading the book to you and the exact spot where you left off both together

94
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.780
thinking that's so it syncs up.

95
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.401
So like your,

96
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.520
you're dumb chapter three,

97
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.354
whatever the fuck it is,

98
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.260
boom.

99
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.100
You get in your car.

100
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.150
Chapter Four.

101
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.860
Bob Walked into the bank,

102
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.540
curious about their intentions,

103
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.810
but knowing that he had worked to do or if you start getting car sick or shit,

104
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.351
you could just like,

105
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:52.561
no,

106
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:53.730
we're just going to listen from here on in.

107
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.250
Yeah.

108
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.140
Copy written stuff anymore.

109
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.771
Yeah.

110
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:57.090
I don't like reading in the car.

111
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:57.400
I get,

112
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.061
I do get car.

113
00:02:58.061 --> 00:02:58.831
So I was getting,

114
00:02:58.831 --> 00:02:59.920
especially in the passion of seats,

115
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.750
if you don't know which way is like it's turning.

116
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.320
Yeah,

117
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.110
try reading a book in a car you can throw up ball.

118
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.980
It was a great way to make your wife on a is for people who love to read but

119
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.840
don't like to fucking read for themselves.

120
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.220
So have someone else do it for you.

121
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.510
And you know what?

122
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.160
I think you get the same benefit.

123
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.491
I mean,

124
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:15.700
yeah.

125
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.861
The,

126
00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:19.390
the benefit is the exercising your imagination and the interacting with other

127
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.224
people's thoughts,

128
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.360
which enriches your consciousness.

129
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.021
So,

130
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.230
uh,

131
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.730
all that shit's available yo@audible.com and they have many,

132
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:27.941
many,

133
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.181
many,

134
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:28.421
many,

135
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.111
many books.

136
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.970
I recommend the war of art.

137
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.210
It's excellent and it's excellent for anybody who's a creative but is suffering

138
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.730
through procrastination and not getting work done.

139
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.190
Fucking,

140
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.610
it'll kick you right in the Dick and get you on point.

141
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.600
So go to audible.

142
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.640
What can I recommend a book?

143
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.030
Sure.

144
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.863
The road,

145
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.930
the road by Cormac Mccarthy because you believe that that's what's happening.

146
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.650
We're going to shoot each other in the head and each of his flesh and all that

147
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:52.840
shit.

148
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.940
If we get to that stage yet,

149
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:54.490
we definitely will,

150
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.130
but it's a good apocalyptic like real book.

151
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.660
That movie was too intense for me.

152
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.650
I want to recommend one.

153
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.330
Go ahead Ralph and the motorcycle.

154
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.201
Ralph in the middle.

155
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:02.530
Same amount.

156
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.363
A little mouse.

157
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.710
What does that just about?

158
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:08.680
This little mouse that rides his motorcycle around and he's a bad ass little

159
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.100
mouse.

160
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.790
Hey falls off.

161
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.780
He falls off the table.

162
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.340
audible.com have this.

163
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.020
Of course.

164
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.790
Most definitely.

165
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.880
They really look it up.

166
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:15.714
See if they,

167
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.900
yeah,

168
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.370
because we can recommend it and the look,

169
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.360
what the fuck word.

170
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.203
Boom.

171
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.500
False advertising,

172
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.334
Bro.

173
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.670

Still alive.

246
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.461

Probably.

254

You would live in Oregon cause it's gorgeous.

258
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.610
Suddenly even illegal in Oregon.

259

Never heard of such a thing as this one.

280

281
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.980

287
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.490
morning.

288
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.920
One of the things that I talk about on this podcast all the time,

289
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:16.910
I can't stress it enough,

290
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.500
is take care of your fucking body,

291
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:18.810
man.

292
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.880
Eat some healthy food.

293
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:20.714
Take some vitamins.

294
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.250
It's all good for you.

295
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.430
And um,

296
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.700
it's,

297
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.900
it's important to do that and to get a little exercise in it makes you fucking

298
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.800
shit work better.

299
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.883
You have freaks.

300
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.863
So go there.

301
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.410
Get yourself some Himalayan salt or some killer bee honey.

302
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.831
That's right.

303
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:34.011
All right,

304
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:35.030
we have killer bee hunting.

305
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.540
Killer bee,

306
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.373
honey.

307
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.861
Ashley,

308
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:38.694
why?

309
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.770
Hey.

310
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.603
Hey broken.

311
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.320
Why do you have killer bee honey?

312
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.270
Cause it sounds fucking bad ass.

313
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.950
That's the only reason to have it.

314
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.850
It's a good idea now.

315
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.610
But wait until those bees want their honey back then where are they going?

316
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:51.110
Do you supply a fucking cell phone around them?

317
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:53.280
They followed the sky pussies.

318
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.310
I remember we talked to two that fighter about honey in Vegas over the weekend

319
00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:57.860
and I'm sorry.

320
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.693
But yeah.

321
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.480
Uh,

322
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.650
Eva,

323
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.700
Eva Edwards.

324
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.170
Yeah.

325
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.940
Yeah.

326
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.130
What about any like curative properties of honey?

327
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:04.964
It actually,

328
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.230
it actually dries you out really quickly because there's so much in there for

329
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:13.690
the buyer process that it takes all the fluids away from your body.

330
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.440
So it helps him cut way back and then,

331
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.771
yeah,

332
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.090
and then they add the,

333
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.241
Oh,

334
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.230
I don't know if that helps me cut weight,

335
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:18.951
but then it adds it up.

336
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.784
That would make sense.

337
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.700
That's an interesting thing.

338
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.853
It's really,

339
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.080
I don't think what he said was scientific and anyway,

340
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.650
so that's not a part of this commercial replenishes everything.

341
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:27.981
I don't know.

342
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
What else does that mean?

343
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.620
If it did dehydrators

344
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:32.721
commercial,

345
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.070
you can't lie in commercials.

346
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.460
Oh,

347
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.420
he can get in trouble.

348
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.450
People like there's nothing in honey that does any of these things.

349
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.650
What they said is clearly a lot what they're doing is deceiving people.

350
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.820
This guy's pretending.

351
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:44.511
Well I don't know.

352
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:45.344
I'm just his friend.

353
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.490
No,

354
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.700
this is a goddamn commercial.

355
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.500
Is this not the commercial part of your show,

356
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:49.330
Mr Rogan?

357
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:49.670
Um,

358
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.720
yeah it's the commercial.

359
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:52.760
But Ari was high and he was just talking shit.

360
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.750
He doesn't really know.

361
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:54.770
He talked to Eve Edwards.

362
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.690
Edwards probably heard it from some fucking guru somewhere.

363
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.670
Don't know if it's necessarily true.

364
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.410
So don't use honey to cut weight.

365
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.230
And unless I wasn't there to cut weight unless it works.

366
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.530
That's what they were saying about removing water.

367
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.250
It just dehydrates you quickly because all your do people that cut.

368
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.093
Wait Dude,

369
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.350
just go into your stomach.

370
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:13.711
What?

371
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.580
Two people that copied to they deactivate themselves.

372
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.060
Yeah,

373
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.391
but it's not,

374
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.880
they're not pissing it out to what's going in here somewhere,

375
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:21.241
I guess.

376
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:21.421
Yeah.

377
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.070
It's going away from your throat and your and your,

378
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:23.280
uh,

379
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.113
the outsides.

380
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.540
Yes.

381
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.180
Thank coding.

382
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.330
Like if you're feeling puffy.

383
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.631
Yeah.

384
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.221
Cause it does lie.

385
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:29.041
Doesn't know what the deal is,

386
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.700
but I'll send you all the fluids in there.

387
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.890
I sort of find out the hunting.

388
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:34.380
If you drink water for your throat,

389
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:34.710
listen,

390
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.570
this sounds like nonsense.

391
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.790
No.

392
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.520
When you're swollen cause you drink too much.

393
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.050
Get rid of that by eating honey.

394
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.710
Yeah,

395
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.880
but I think it's soothing.

396
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.030
I think it's actually good for like injuries like scratches and shit on your

397
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:47.880
skin.

398
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.271
They can't.

399
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:48.781
It has.

400
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:51.180
I'm like antifungal properties.

401
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.690
Yeah.

402
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:51.931
Yeah.

403
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.140
It's,

404
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.060
it's also they use it as a preservative.

405
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.230
They used to store their mushrooms in honey when they had psychedelic mushrooms

406
00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:58.591
and they would,

407
00:09:58.591 --> 00:09:58.830
uh,

408
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.400
they,

409
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.670
they dry them out and they would store them in honey to keep it from going bad.

410
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.593
Yeah.

411
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.890
And they speculate.

412
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.710
That is one of the original ways,

413
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.100
and this is just pure speculation that human beings started,

414
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.550
uh,

415
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.520
drinking alcoholic beverages was fermented honey.

416
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.080
Oh,

417
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.930
it's called mead.

418
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.530
Yeah.

419
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.363
That's me.

420
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.111
Yeah.

421
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:19.080
Have you ever had meat?

422
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.973
No.

423
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.043
I mean either.

424
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.421
Yeah,

425
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:21.830
honey.

426
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:21.990
Well,

427
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.600
it's a,

428
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.700
it's people who've had,

429
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.001
you know,

430
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:25.050
honey try that though.

431
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.560
Used,

432
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.870
they've used it as a preservative for a long ass time.

433
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.180
It's a homeopathic doctor and Portland told me the honey is super great for,

434
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.880
you know what I just heard quack

435
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.120
homeopathic doctor.

436
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:36.691
Get outta here.

437
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:37.381
What your crystals.

438
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:39.920
You fuckhead no crystal clear.

439
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.550
Throw your Chinese herbs.

440
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.440
It's 2013 bitch.

441
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.303
Okay.

442
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.570
Get away from me.

443
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.780
I'm your fucking green powder and you're,

444
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.010
you're voodoo medicine.

445
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.570
Heard kettle bells in your life and become manly as fuck or I should fear,

446
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.960
do some cleans and snatches.

447
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:59.250
There's 60 pounders over there.

448
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.400
If in the middle of the show you just feel fired up and you ready to do a

449
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:05.940
Turkish getup at 60 pounds and let the world know what the fuck is up.

450
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:06.360
All right.

451
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.810
You go to shows.

452
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.903
He got it on you.

453
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.470
I had 20 pounds nvidia and that fucking shattered my knee.

454
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.950
You choose to add an interesting soul.

455
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:14.784
Ari,

456
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.943
Ari,

457
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.581
he chose,

458
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:19.410
you chose this path that you're going through.

459
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.731
Yeah.

460
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.700
I don't know all of that stuff I love yet,

461
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.650
but I chose a body.

462
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.730
That's the weirdest one.

463
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:27.511
Well,

464
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:30.120
the idea is you can't see any basis for that.

465
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.720
Yeah.

466
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.910
The idea is that you came from another dimension.

467
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.470
I think just what she's trying to say.

468
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:34.751
I don't,

469
00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:35.880
I don't necessarily agree with it,

470
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:36.720
but I see what you're saying.

471
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.860
Um,

472
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.693
anyway,

473
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.080
fuck all that.

474
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.620
The way to combat all that silliness is it gets a manly shit in your life.

475
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:44.790
Like some battle ropes,

476
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.913
right?

477
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.120
Go get some hemp protein powder,

478
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:49.200
which by the way,

479
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.090
Colorado is trying to grow hemp.

480
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:54.250
Now this is going to be very interesting because hemp,

481
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.750
<v 1>you should know the hemp that we use to s uh,</v>

482
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.750
to make hemp force protein powder.

483
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.720
It's very expensive and we can't grow it ourselves.

484
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.130
We have to buy it in Canada.

485
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.503
It's crazy.

486
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.570
The reason why is because it is not illegal and it's not psychoactive,

487
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.080
but it is not legal to grow it in America.

488
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.130
It's a crazy thing.

489
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:16.090
Like if you have it,

490
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.290
nobody can do anything.

491
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.050
If you bought it from another country,

492
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.670
it's absolutely okay to have,

493
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.900
it's not illegal,

494
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.520
but you can't grow it yourself.

495
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.550
It is one of the wackiest stupidest examples of bureaucracy,

496
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.090
government and,

497
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:38.110
and the idea that the people that run things are the best ones for the job and

498
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.630
the most logical representatives of the human race.

499
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.210
That shit is ridiculous.

500
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:43.180
It's not the case.

501
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.530
We have a bunch of monkeys.

502
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.980
They made a bunch of dumb ass laws and some of them are still in place and they

503
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:49.960
should be removed asap.

504
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.880
Anyone with power?

505
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.640
Obama would look at this and say,

506
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.950
this is not even a drug issue.

507
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.520
Okay,

508
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.241
Mr. Obama,

509
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.074
sir.

510
00:12:59.420 --> 00:12:59.890
Um,

511
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.970
it's not even a drug issue.

512
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.331
Okay.

513
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:01.541
What?

514
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.231
This is an issue.

515
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:03.580
It's an agriculture issue.

516
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.650
There's an amazing plant.

517
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.750
Take away the whole weed thing,

518
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.010
throw it out the door.

519
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.930
There's an amazing plant that's essentially a cousin to different strain of the

520
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.780
same plant and it's not psychoactive.

521
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.540
And what it is is amazing.

522
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.970
You can make food with it.

523
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.710
It makes nutritious bars.

524
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.300
We sell hemp bars on,

525
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:25.441
on,

526
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:26.530
on at.com as well.

527
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:27.850
Now they're fucking awesome.

528
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.860
You can make clothes with it.

529
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.450
Superior close.

530
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:31.760
The,

531
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.990
the reason why canvas is called canvas,

532
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.490
the word cannabis,

533
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.660
hemp hemp is what they used to make fucking canvas.

534
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.990
Hemp is what was used in the parachute that George Bush Sr perisher does safety

535
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:48.190
with in World War II.

536
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.960
I mean it's fucking,

537
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.853
or was it Korea,

538
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.843
whatever it was.

539
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.713
How those wars?

540
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.380
One of those wars,

541
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.213
I think it was World War II.

542
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.750
My point being,

543
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.930
it's an amazing plant outside of the fact that you can make oil with it.

544
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.380
You can heat your house with it.

545
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:04.340
You could actually make a house with it outside.

546
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.150
The fact that Henry Ford's first fucking car,

547
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.030
the panels of the car were made out of hemp.

548
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.280
This is bananas.

549
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.761
Okay.

550
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:15.990
This is an unbelievably anything,

551
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.750
no,

552
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.290
nothing.

553
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:17.651
Zero.

554
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:18.520
You can make a pipe out of it.

555
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:19.090
I guess.

556
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.340
It's unbelievably wait,

557
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.393
rolling papers.

558
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.680
It's unbelievably useful.

559
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.430
It's an amazing,

560
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.790
it's,

561
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.790
I would say it's the boast useful plant on the face of the earth unless they

562
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:34.330
come up with some new plant that has an unbelievable regenerative capabilities

563
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:37.690
and cures Alzheimer's disease and they find it in the jungle until they find

564
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:38.350
that plan.

565
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.350
I would say that hemp is the most useful plant on the face of the earth.

566
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.820
And it's illegal.

567
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.290
I would say a furnace.

568
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.840
That's a fern fern.

569
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.340
Well that's cause cause you're trying to define it.

570
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.633
Um,

571
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.810
but Colorado is growing happened now,

572
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:58.370
so it's a really interesting,

573
00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:58.730
um,

574
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.980
I'm really curious to see what he's a federal government going to rate them.

575
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.970
That's a good question.

576
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.500
We're going to find out because if they read them,

577
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.490
the rate of them for what?

578
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:04.881
It's a,

579
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:06.050
it's an agriculture issue,

580
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.510
it's an issue that really should be resolved because uh,

581
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.810
I think they're worried that it looks too much like marijuana and that people

582
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:12.620
are going to grow.

583
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.680
It does this and that.

584
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:13.851
Yeah.

585
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:14.684
It looks just like it.

586
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.890
So people are going to grow.

587
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:17.000
It just doesn't have buds.

588
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.930
The buds would get you high so that people are going to grow it and they're

589
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:21.470
going to say,

590
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.880
oh those scrolling up.

591
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.890
And he'd go there and they've got a marijuana drug business.

592
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.890
So since Colorado is making marijuana legal,

593
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.630
they're uh,

594
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.010
they're also trying to grow hemp.

595
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.300
Hmm.

596
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:32.870
That makes sense.

597
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.340
Yeah.

598
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.100
We'll get it.

599
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.641
Get it together.

600
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:35.360
America.

601
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.590
It's just some stupid shit.

602
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.630
I can't be the reason they're keeping it illegal.

603
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.470
That just is the reason because what apart that is the reason,

604
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.821
the excuse,

605
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:44.570
but it's also,

606
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.960
there's other companies that make a bunch of different shit,

607
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:48.830
including paper.

608
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:50.930
The reason why I was made illegal in the first place was a,

609
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.640
it was like a textile issue.

610
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.511
It was a,

611
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:54.950
an issue around me.

612
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.551
Yeah.

613
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:57.830
It was an issue as hemp,

614
00:15:57.831 --> 00:15:58.664
as a commodity.

615
00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.490
That's what it was.

616
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.323
They were worried.

617
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.831
First of all,

618
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:03.440
William Randolph Hearst was with Harry Anslinger.

619
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.870
They're the ones that initiated it through her snooze papers.

620
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:10.871
They just made up stories about Mexicans and blacks raping these white women

621
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.690
because of the pot.

622
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.740
They blamed it on,

623
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.190
uh,

624
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.290
this thing called marijuana,

625
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.210
which was a new drug that nobody ever heard of,

626
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.190
even though everybody was familiar with hemp.

627
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.620
So they came up with a new name for it.

628
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.800
But the new name wasn't even the real needs of marijuana before.

629
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.190
Marijuana was a while form of Mexican tobacco.

630
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.130
It wasn't even marijuana pot.

631
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.480
It was a different thing.

632
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.711
Oh,

633
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:34.640
so what do they have before?

634
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:35.181
Allegedly,

635
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:36.620
but what have I got all this online?

636
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.431
What would they spoken for?

637
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:39.050
Cause they found marijuana in ancient Egypt.

638
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.160
Yes.

639
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.470
So that you're not paying attention.

640
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.850
Marijuana.

641
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:47.570
The word marijuana was invented to demonize it.

642
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.070
Marijuana has existed for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

643
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.690
That's not the issue.

644
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.110
The issue is the word marijuana wasn't created by William Randolph Hearst and

645
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:04.151
Harry Anslinger and putting these newspapers and that use the use of that word

646
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:05.360
to describe cannabis.

647
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.830
That's the only time they,

648
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.610
they used it.

649
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.480
Marijuana is a Mexican word for a wild form of tobacco.

650
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.980
It's not a slang.

651
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.150
Initially it wasn't.

652
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.343
Of course it is now.

653
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.650
It was not a slam dunk cannabis plant.

654
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:17.750
No,

655
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.410
I got that.

656
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.730
But when you said they use it to demonize this new drug will put it called it a

657
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:24.380
new drug or they called it marijuana.

658
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.310
They didn't know what they were making it fly that name to what they were spoken

659
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:28.920
before.

660
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.753
Exactly.

661
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.170
It didn't everybody know like,

662
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.550
well no,

663
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.241
we've already smoked that.

664
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.200
That's like exactly.

665
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.890
It didn't matter.

666
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.100
There's new laws now and there was this,

667
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.250
the first did it with like,

668
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:37.721
it was like a,

669
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:38.810
a tax thing.

670
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.720
You had to get a stamp and then they made it totally illegal.

671
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.630
It was like a couple of steps and essentially they took a lot of the people that

672
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:47.140
were working in prohibition and uh,

673
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.270
the ones prohibition went away for alcohol.

674
00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:49.601
They just said,

675
00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:49.750
well,

676
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.580
just fucking get these people to work for weed.

677
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.390
And they,

678
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.700
they just went after marijuana,

679
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.050
which was cannabis.

680
00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.740
Before that,

681
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.850
before that it was cannabis.

682
00:17:57.851 --> 00:17:58.870
Everybody knew what is cannabis.

683
00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.920
So all of a sudden you're like,

684
00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:00.091
wait,

685
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:00.190
what?

686
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.671
You're calling it?

687
00:18:00.671 --> 00:18:01.504
What?

688
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.890
And now it's illegal.

689
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.791
And when,

690
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.440
when the people who made it,

691
00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:06.400
when they voted on it,

692
00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.900
when they made it illegal,

693
00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:09.750
they didn't even know they're making hempy legal.

694
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.230
Like it was so confusing.

695
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.310
They were trying to stop this new drug that was just spreading across the nation

696
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:19.420
and whites were getting raped by Mexicans and blacks and it's called marijuana.

697
00:18:19.421 --> 00:18:19.871
And there was like,

698
00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:20.290
but,

699
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.123
but if they said,

700
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.490
and a few people are smoking cannabis and they're raping,

701
00:18:24.491 --> 00:18:24.881
you'd be like,

702
00:18:24.881 --> 00:18:25.714
wait a minute.

703
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.180
When did they start raping?

704
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:27.770
Like,

705
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.550
cause you vogue has always been smoking cannabis,

706
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.490
<v 2>but then they describe marijuana.</v>

707
00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:33.590
They described like the lick the leaf of a,

708
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.483
of a cannabis.

709
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.830
Like how do they apply the two together?

710
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.760
What,

711
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.770
when you said late had this new drug called marijuana.

712
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.350
Yeah.

713
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.520
<v 1>They just need renamed it.</v>

714
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:42.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.793
But then how did the,

716
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.500
how did people think that that was the marijuana they were talking about?

717
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.590
How did they think that was cannabis they were talking about and not,

718
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.060
<v 1>they didn't,</v>

719
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.690
that's why,

720
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.070
that's why they made it illegal.

721
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.950
And they didn't even understand that marijuana was cannabis.

722
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.310
Right?

723
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.421
Oh,

724
00:18:56.421 --> 00:18:59.280
in the bill when they were making marijuana illegal,

725
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:01.440
they thought they were making this new drug,

726
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.570
this new thing that they'd become aware of.

727
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.190
They thought they were making that illegal.

728
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.190
That's why they named it marijuana when they were going after it.

729
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:08.610
And these,

730
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.510
these stories.

731
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.440
So when William Randolph Hearst wrote all these propaganda things and that's

732
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:15.300
when reefer madness came out and all this,

733
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.160
all this propaganda came out.

734
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.170
It's showing like people taking that,

735
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:20.460
I want it going crazy.

736
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.130
All that was instigated because William Randolph first,

737
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:23.551
first of all,

738
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:26.640
he owned paper mills and the paper mills use,

739
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:31.110
they use trees and hemp is far superior for making paper.

740
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.220
It's a better paper.

741
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.900
It lasts longer and you can grow four times as much.

742
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.460
You can also grow it.

743
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.620
It replenishes itself within months.

744
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.920
Whereas with trees it takes years for trees to grow.

745
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.580
You can replenish an entire forest of hemp and a few months.

746
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.261
I mean it's,

747
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:50.100
it's an unbelievable resource.

748
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.971
So we ran off,

749
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:54.360
her son knew that he was going to have to change over all of his paper mills and

750
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.490
all of its forests that were filled with trees.

751
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.210
He was going to have to change that shit over it to make hemp paper now.

752
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.300
And the reason being was because they came up with a new product called the

753
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:04.170
decorticator.

754
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.580
And what a decorticator is,

755
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:09.120
is a machine that allowed them to effectively process the hemp fiber.

756
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:09.631
So the,

757
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:11.760
for the first time they didn't have to use slave labor,

758
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.220
which was like the only way they did it before.

759
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.730
And then once the cotton gin came along,

760
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.071
they were like,

761
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:17.311
well,

762
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:21.380
why are we fucking around with this hemp shit when it's too difficult to break

763
00:20:21.381 --> 00:20:23.760
down the hemp fiber when we can just do cotton.

764
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.170
Cotton is not as strong,

765
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.340
but it's easier to make.

766
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.410
Then the decorticator came out and they're like,

767
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:28.860
look,

768
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.570
we figured out a better way to deal with the hemp.

769
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.620
Let's get back to him.

770
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.000
And William Randolph first was like,

771
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:33.990
fuck that.

772
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.840
No,

773
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.970
that's going to cost me money.

774
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.590
So that one cunt,

775
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.000
that one shithead,

776
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.110
the reason why,

777
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:40.580
I mean that's,

778
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.490
that's Rosebud,

779
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.120
that's there.

780
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.200
I mean he was such a mega maniacal cunt that Orson Welles made a fucking movie

781
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:46.770
about him.

782
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.370
He was,

783
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:47.860
yeah,

784
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.820
we ran up first.

785
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.930
He was a real piece of shit and that's what he did this fuck face.

786
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.010
So one guy,

787
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.450
him and Harry Anslinger and the and all the,

788
00:20:58.451 --> 00:20:58.900
the,

789
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.680
there was a lot of people involved that were benefiting from marijuana being

790
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:03.011
illegal.

791
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:03.760
It's just like

792
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.500
<v 2>when they lobbied now in the bill,</v>

793
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:06.730
they said to get rid of this thing,

794
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.310
this new drug called marijuana in that no

795
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.011
<v 1>doing,</v>

796
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:09.751
who's trying to stop,

797
00:21:09.751 --> 00:21:13.290
can't hemp because the new decorticator had been invented so they were trying to

798
00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:13.950
stop pimp.

799
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.460
The way they decided to stop him was classifying it as marijuana,

800
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:18.930
classifying it as a new drug.

801
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.220
It was just a sneaky,

802
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.121
underhanded,

803
00:21:21.121 --> 00:21:22.050
shitty thing to do.

804
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.361
<v 2>Wanted to start it.</v>

805
00:21:24.361 --> 00:21:25.194
Is that what you're doing,

806
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.360
but just make reminding you that you're in a commercial.

807
00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:28.194
I know,

808
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.601
but I,

809
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:31.350
I don't want to talk about this anymore on the podcast because we've talked

810
00:21:31.351 --> 00:21:32.790
about on the podcast a million times.

811
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.020
I thought you already knew this story.

812
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:34.591
Yeah,

813
00:21:34.591 --> 00:21:34.861
I did.

814
00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:35.730
I just didn't understand.

815
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:37.520
I was only trying to clarify when he,

816
00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:40.620
when you said he made up as new drug called marijuana made up the name.

817
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.310
Yeah.

818
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.580
But then how do people know that we're talking about weed instead of cocaine or

819
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:45.480
any other drug?

820
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.120
<v 1>Because they said this is marijuana.</v>

821
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:48.790
They showed you the,

822
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.540
we showed you the leaf and they showed you the buds and they,

823
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.440
they showed,

824
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.720
but what fuck people up was,

825
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.290
there had been people that have been smoking that shit forever and then farmers

826
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:01.350
had been using that shit forever would fuck people up.

827
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:01.681
I was like,

828
00:22:01.681 --> 00:22:02.514
wait a minute.

829
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.720
The Popular Science magazine cover that just came out was hemp,

830
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.090
the new billion dollar crop.

831
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.360
So what they did was they went fuck that.

832
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.880
And they stopped that and they put the brakes on it.

833
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:16.920
That's why hemp is illegal.

834
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.500
<v 2>So he's only allel as marijuana.</v>

835
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:20.820
Only reason they're having hemp illegal.

836
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:24.420
Now it's for the same reason that only that they had marijuana illegal before.

837
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.920
Just cause it looks like the other thing,

838
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.910
the only reason marijuana was ever made illegal in the first place just because

839
00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:30.980
it looked like nothing

840
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.980
<v 1>to do with getting high off because in fact doctors had been prescribing hemp</v>

841
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.001
the,

842
00:22:38.001 --> 00:22:41.030
the edible marijuana form of it for remedies.

843
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.450
It would.

844
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.220
It had been in medicines forever,

845
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.353
like people had,

846
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.380
doctors had prescribed marijuana for people like edible forms of marijuana

847
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.310
forever.

848
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.350
There was no worries about that.

849
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.880
They use it as a trick.

850
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.710
They use that as a trick.

851
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.850
It was just ignorance.

852
00:22:55.851 --> 00:22:57.230
People didn't know any better back then.

853
00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.970
They snuck it in and that's the reason it had nothing to do with getting high.

854
00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:05.060
It had everything to do with stopping hemp as a commodity,

855
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.200
as something that you can make cars with the Henry Ford car,

856
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:09.801
the first car,

857
00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:10.430
you should see it.

858
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.650
He whacks the fucking fenders with a hammer.

859
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.180
It's this hemp fiber.

860
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.310
Hemp is like an alien planet.

861
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.570
It's the weirdest thing ever.

862
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.010
If you don't know about it,

863
00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:20.570
if you've never encountered it.

864
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.340
When when you think about Pod,

865
00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:24.020
all you think about it as like smoking and getting high,

866
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.440
but the stalk of the plant is like,

867
00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:29.120
it's from another planet.

868
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.910
It can be that thick around,

869
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:32.780
but like a thick,

870
00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:34.490
like a fat man's leg.

871
00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.383
Okay.

872
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.230
Or not a fat man.

873
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.840
Fat Man's calf is what I meant to say like that.

874
00:23:38.841 --> 00:23:43.580
Thick around and really light but unbelievably hard.

875
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.840
It's weird.

876
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.411
I get it.

877
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.550
There's nothing like it.

878
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.950
It's like this big hard thing,

879
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.611
but it's light.

880
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:50.220
It's fuck.

881
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.140
You can whip it around.

882
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.460
It doesn't make any sense.

883
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:53.960
It's like if it was Balsa wood,

884
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.651
it would be that light,

885
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:56.210
but it would just break apart in your hands.

886
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.410
He's smashing on things.

887
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:58.370
You put a big dents in it.

888
00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.880
Not hamp.

889
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.110
No.

890
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.130
Hemp is hard,

891
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.323
but it's light.

892
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.860
It's really weird.

893
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:05.360
It has incredible properties.

894
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.940
You make amazing cloth out of it.

895
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.320
So hard to rip.

896
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.720
Like I have a hamp Gucci bag that dot.

897
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.680
Sarah made me that Sir is a cool company that makes uh,

898
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.090
they make camp gies.

899
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:17.720
They make hemp,

900
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:17.930
uh,

901
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.763
Gucci bags,

902
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.330
laptop bags and shit like that.

903
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.223
You could have,

904
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.240
you could fucking pull on it,

905
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:23.481
man.

906
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:27.140
You are not ripping that stuff and it's not resistance to like bacteria.

907
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:27.974
Exactly.

908
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.630
Well it is resistant to bacteria.

909
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.021
Yeah.

910
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:30.360
Yeah.

911
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:30.890
It's,

912
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:31.910
it's an amazing plant.

913
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.170
It's fucking amazing.

914
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:34.910
You don't need pesticides with it.

915
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:35.770
It's just,

916
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.410
it's eating,

917
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:36.960
eat it.

918
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.510
It has all the essential fatty acids.

919
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.840
He sound like such a Hippie Douche when you go on and on and on about it.

920
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.220
But it's so amazing.

921
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:44.990
It's hard to believe that it's real.

922
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:50.170
It's hard to believe that it's a real situation that we live in 2013 and with

923
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:51.530
all the information that we have today,

924
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:52.550
that's still illegal.

925
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.430
And then there's a giant truck to park behind the fucking door.

926
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.360
Uh Huh.

927
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.200
Why is this cut back?

928
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:58.550
He parking right behind us.

929
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.170
We have a spot back there.

930
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:01.300
He shouldn't be parking there anyway.

931
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.150
That fuck face.

932
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.000
Treat everyone as if it was you living another life.

933
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:07.370
Unless they have a loud ass truck and they're being country.

934
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.730
All right folks at the music or it should be,

935
00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:10.000

936
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.281

941
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.460
You're dirty fucks.

942
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:24.850

00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:57.711

00:25:57.711 --> 00:25:58.160
hi.

972
00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.460
Oh,

974
00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.660
This guy's a great,

975
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.260
yeah.

976
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.411
Yeah.

977
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:02.060
There were way cooler than I thought,

978
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.510
you know?

979
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.631
Oh,

980
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:02.931
really?

981
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:03.860
You didn't think they're going to be cool?

982
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.620
I just didn't know when.

983
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.321
Anytime you tell me some,

984
00:26:05.321 --> 00:26:06.590
he's been in the business for 30 years.

985
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:08.210
I just assume that means of,

986
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.350
and they're not gonna like me.

987
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:10.161
Yeah.

988
00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:12.500
You assume they're old and they're like,

989
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.000
just add a touch,

990
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:14.540
right?

991
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:14.781
Yeah.

992
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:17.270
Something that's soft world of radio.

993
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:18.501
Yeah.

994
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:20.030
I just look at them as adults or something.

995
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:20.960
It's like you've been in some,

996
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.853
I dunno,

997
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.910
as opposed to self.

998
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.330
Yeah.

999
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.810
Or just the people that know.

1000
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.390
People think of you as an adult,

1001
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:26.930
you find,

1002
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.660
I guess so you'll have middle aged.

1003
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.640
Yeah.

1004
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.890
Who Don't really have a grown up.

1005
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.510
You're that you're middle age.

1006
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.543
Fuck.

1007
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.790
I look like such as love.

1008
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.001
Yeah.

1009
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:35.541
You're middle age.

1010
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:36.374
If you're lucky.

1011
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:38.810
If you're lucky lived in [inaudible] 72,

1012
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:39.740
73 years old.

1013
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.603
That's pretty good.

1014
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.050
I hope I don't get black mold.

1015
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.010
It'll just stay there.

1016
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.150
You've got black mom.

1017
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.490
It would be the end of May.

1018
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.520
There will be no cleaning.

1019
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.580
They definitely should do studies on my body afterwards to see what happens.

1020
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:51.630
For prolonged use.

1021
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.063
Yeah.

1022
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.110
They would look at your apartment alone.

1023
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:56.460
So this mother fucker is like,

1024
00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:57.030
he's,

1025
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.863
he's a study.

1026
00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.320
It's just studying what you,

1027
00:26:59.321 --> 00:27:00.240
what the body can,

1028
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.860
the body can deflect.

1029
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.710
There's like 18 different toxins.

1030
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.920
I handle it all.

1031
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:05.754
Hold off.

1032
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.080
So what happened with your cousin?

1033
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:08.760
Your cousin got busted by the Nigerians.

1034
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.710
My friend's brother was,

1035
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.010
uh,

1036
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.010
started getting real coffee to everybody and saying,

1037
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.873
um,

1038
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.893
uh,

1039
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.550
you'll see real soon.

1040
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:19.470
I won't have to take the shit anymore from you.

1041
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.340
Whoa.

1042
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.840
And just started being like an asshole.

1043
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.111
And I'm like,

1044
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.920
what's your story like?

1045
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.090
I got a plan going.

1046
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:26.070
I'm going to be a really rich really soon.

1047
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1048
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.030
<v 0>Um,</v>

1049
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.820
if he was,

1050
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.050
he was in contact with this Nigerian prince who was trying to get out,

1051
00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:36.500
but needed someone to transfer the money to for reward,

1052
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.040
like v Scam.

1053
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.290
He fell for the scam five or six years ago.

1054
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:45.880
Not long enough where it's like,

1055
00:27:45.881 --> 00:27:47.650
you must be the first one to find out about it.

1056
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.580
Wow.

1057
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.473
Yeah.

1058
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.583
Yeah.

1059
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:52.730
Tim's a little brother.

1060
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.880
It's what's hilarious is that he started getting douchey first.

1061
00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:56.640
Yeah.

1062
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.370
Like that's how you're reacting to this money.

1063
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.720
Did you see him like toll being told like the whole thing?

1064
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.901
Like,

1065
00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:04.610
did you see how he just told us about it later?

1066
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.760
But you know the way like Eddie Bravo convince them you're getting 10 grand and

1067
00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:08.481
he was getting 10 grand.

1068
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:09.380
He was super nice to you.

1069
00:28:09.381 --> 00:28:09.621
He goes,

1070
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.070
Brian,

1071
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.270
you were about to come into some money.

1072
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.450
Like that's a nice way,

1073
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.790
person's way of reacting to it.

1074
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.140
And then this guy's like,

1075
00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:15.321
hey,

1076
00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:16.280
fuck you bitches.

1077
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.720
I'm about to be out of here.

1078
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.030
You imagine if that guy actually hit the lottery.

1079
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:20.864
What a content.

1080
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.780
There's some people that are like that.

1081
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.450
They were like undercover cunts and they're,

1082
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.680
they're just ready to just like find a reason.

1083
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:31.100
Like they'd been thinking about everybody for a longest time.

1084
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:32.230
Yeah.

1085
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.370
Did they just wait for that one opportunity to express themselves some?

1086
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.710
I got it.

1087
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.080
Nah,

1088
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.913
you fucks.

1089
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.111
Yeah.

1090
00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:39.960
That happens with a,

1091
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.813
with actors.

1092
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.230
Yeah.

1093
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.450
You know,

1094
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.851
we were too.

1095
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:42.890
Melissa Etheridge is now,

1096
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:45.350
we're talking about that yesterday about people who make it and then once they

1097
00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:45.711
make it,

1098
00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:48.590
they just act like everybody owes them.

1099
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.250
Yeah.

1100
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.083
Douchey.

1101
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.491
Yeah.

1102
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:50.691
Not,

1103
00:28:50.691 --> 00:28:51.390
I pulled away.

1104
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.790
Just acts like an ass.

1105
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.540
Yeah.

1106
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:53.900
Wow.

1107
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.081
Yeah.

1108
00:28:54.081 --> 00:28:54.561
That's what it is.

1109
00:28:54.561 --> 00:28:57.060
Undercover constants that I want to cover costs.

1110
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.561
Yeah.

1111
00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:57.951
That's so,

1112
00:28:57.951 --> 00:28:58.370
uh,

1113
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.190
when like when someone would be like,

1114
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:03.080
I would smell something and somebody,

1115
00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:03.771
so he's a good guy.

1116
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:04.011
I'm like,

1117
00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:04.910
he's an undercover cop.

1118
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.480
It was just waiting in the wings,

1119
00:29:08.481 --> 00:29:11.450
waiting for that moment where he has the control.

1120
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.583
You know,

1121
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.120
he's that guy in the movie that,

1122
00:29:14.121 --> 00:29:14.390
you know,

1123
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.550
locks the door and the monsters go and eat all the people that were outside.

1124
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.330
I'm sorry your guys like you still have time.

1125
00:29:20.331 --> 00:29:21.164
It's like 20 week,

1126
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.250
30 yards away,

1127
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:26.720
opening the monsters in his room and he doesn't realize it always gets him in

1128
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.171
the movie.

1129
00:29:27.171 --> 00:29:28.340
That guy always gets jacked.

1130
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:28.941
Right.

1131
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:29.774
That's um,

1132
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.500
Paul Riser in aliens.

1133
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:33.440
Do you remember what did he do in the early risers?

1134
00:29:33.441 --> 00:29:34.700
Best role was not,

1135
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.090
uh,

1136
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.630
not about you.

1137
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:36.710
Not about Jews.

1138
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.640
Paul risers best role was eight.

1139
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.980
What?

1140
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.120
He was the bad guy and he should've quit right there.

1141
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:43.991
Cause that,

1142
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.310
that mad about you was just,

1143
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.040
he went from comic to aliens to then Sitcom.

1144
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.461
Yeah.

1145
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.660
And he was really good.

1146
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:50.201
And Aliens,

1147
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.490
he's a really good actor.

1148
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.110
What was he like?

1149
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.850
And he was a Douche bag in the movie.

1150
00:29:53.851 --> 00:29:54.280
It was just like,

1151
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.400
oh,

1152
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.160
this guy who was like ass kissy guy.

1153
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.420
I'm so came from this company.

1154
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:01.660
But then as the reality of these aliens gets revealed,

1155
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.590
he's on this other planet.

1156
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.330
As the reality of these aliens gets revealed,

1157
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.130
he just becomes more and more mercenary.

1158
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:06.971
And then,

1159
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:07.260
uh,

1160
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.540
you know,

1161
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.720
at the end like I don't want to give them a spoiler alerts,

1162
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.563
but

1163
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.660
no,

1164
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.970
he get his,

1165
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.150
if it's been 30 years,

1166
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:16.750
you can go on.

1167
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.500
Yeah.

1168
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.640
Well he gets fucked.

1169
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.020
If you've never seen aliens,

1170
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:20.561
it's awesome.

1171
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.660
But don't get it in blue ray.

1172
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.290
Why?

1173
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.320
Because the special effects were not designed for Blue Ray.

1174
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.390
Oh really?

1175
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:29.530
When you look at,

1176
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.330
there's a scene where,

1177
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.080
um,

1178
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.860
Sigourney weaver is being taken towards where,

1179
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.870
where this ship is and they have the ship and it looks like shit.

1180
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:42.210
It's because you have that true motion thing.

1181
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.790
No,

1182
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:42.971
no,

1183
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:43.091
no,

1184
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:43.241
no.

1185
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.074
You don't understand.

1186
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.681
I mean,

1187
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:46.960
it looks like shit because it looks like a painting.

1188
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.231
Yeah,

1189
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:47.471
I know.

1190
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:47.800
But yeah,

1191
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.480
that true emotion shit on dude.

1192
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:50.314
It's sitting there.

1193
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.183
It's a painting.

1194
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:51.881
I mean,

1195
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:52.551
it is a pain.

1196
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:53.384
It's true emotion.

1197
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.251
What it is,

1198
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:54.640
is look,

1199
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.640
they put a backdrop on some sets instead of creating massive environment.

1200
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.170
Instead of doing that,

1201
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.790
they'll make this huge canvas and paint this canvas or realistic like fighter

1202
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:07.300
jet.

1203
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.300
Well to in a regular resolution film of the time of like 1984 or something like

1204
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:12.731
that,

1205
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:13.480
whatever it was.

1206
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.530
When aliens came out,

1207
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.423
that was fine.

1208
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.790
They would just put that up and it would look great and it really did look right

1209
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:19.481
in those movies.

1210
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:21.070
It was dark and dimly lit,

1211
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.060
but in blue ray,

1212
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:25.240
you see every pixel and you see that stupid painting.

1213
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:25.481
I'm like,

1214
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:27.220
I'm supposed to think that's a spaceship.

1215
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.260
Like all of a sudden the movie sucks.

1216
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.310
Like right away,

1217
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:35.080
this movie sucks down looking at this stupid fucking painted space ship.

1218
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:35.440
Like,

1219
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:35.830
what do you think?

1220
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.663
I'm a baby?

1221
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.390
What am I,

1222
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.223
what is this?

1223
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.011
When they were doing it,

1224
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:39.844
somebody was like,

1225
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.040
people can tell when they come this way.

1226
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.261
He's like,

1227
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:41.561
Nah,

1228
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:42.580
technology is not that good.

1229
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.320
Yeah,

1230
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.410
fine for 30 years.

1231
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:44.740
Easy.

1232
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:44.860
Well,

1233
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.121
it's true.

1234
00:31:45.121 --> 00:31:46.510
Motion does that with a lot of movies.

1235
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:47.600
Awesome emotion.

1236
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.530
True motion makes movies a look fake.

1237
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:51.860
But that's like,

1238
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.260
you could see like the,

1239
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.730
the detail of like,

1240
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.091
oh,

1241
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:57.220
that's just an old wall and some office,

1242
00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:57.481
you know,

1243
00:31:57.481 --> 00:31:57.630
like,

1244
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:57.970
like,

1245
00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.350
or how it's filmed.

1246
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.330
You could just see the acting too much.

1247
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.110
So many frames per second that it becomes really,

1248
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.820
it comes really realistic.

1249
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.320
And you like you,

1250
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:08.651
you know,

1251
00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:11.530
you ever notice how like film things like softer,

1252
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.000
it's like,

1253
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.450
yeah,

1254
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.440
the videos,

1255
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.121
videos.

1256
00:32:14.121 --> 00:32:14.631
Like you know,

1257
00:32:14.631 --> 00:32:16.950
you're like a video on your cell phone when you're drunk and you make it,

1258
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.500
you know,

1259
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.580
it's fucking harsh.

1260
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.721
Really harsh.

1261
00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:20.800
So lighting's really harsh.

1262
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.360
Well that's what this is.

1263
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:24.490
It's like it's better really.

1264
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.560
It's like you see things for what they really are,

1265
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.330
but unfortunately what they really are,

1266
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:29.200
it's not that good.

1267
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.810
Like when I was on a news radio,

1268
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.531
the Sitcom,

1269
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:34.810
they were just starting to use HD.

1270
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.550
And one of the things that they said,

1271
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:41.551
this is the nineties needs radio started in 94 and it ended in 99 [inaudible]

1272
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.260
and I'm,

1273
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.470
one of the things they said was that they're going to have HD and these

1274
00:32:46.471 --> 00:32:47.880
actresses are fucked.

1275
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.451
Oh yeah.

1276
00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:49.284
Cause they're to see,

1277
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.330
they're going to see what they really look like.

1278
00:32:51.331 --> 00:32:51.750
Yeah.

1279
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.700
Because if they make you up right,

1280
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.241
and they,

1281
00:32:54.241 --> 00:32:54.511
you know,

1282
00:32:54.511 --> 00:32:57.990
they do your lips and they put you in their soft lights and you're on a regular,

1283
00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.840
you can look pretty God damn good when you don't look good,

1284
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.190
when you see them in real life,

1285
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:03.980
they don't have like good skin or they're,

1286
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.260
you know,

1287
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.840
a lot of times they can really doctor you up.

1288
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.560
Amazing.

1289
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.460
So what do we do now?

1290
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.570
Now they're fuck the girls have to be better looking if they,

1291
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.570
she can't fake it anymore.

1292
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:13.141
Yeah.

1293
00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:18.141
I mean people are used to really graphic high resolution porn.

1294
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.021
You know,

1295
00:33:19.021 --> 00:33:22.170
where you see every zit on the girl's ass and you know,

1296
00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:23.004
and uh,

1297
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.640
if people are in the,

1298
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.790
they're into what they call a cream pieing which is the common size.

1299
00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:33.450
One of the first suggestion court the come out.

1300
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.620
But it's like,

1301
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.120
that's what people are into their into like super detailed,

1302
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.860
just like really bubbled and gusting.

1303
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.491
Yeah,

1304
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:42.324
exactly.

1305
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:43.590
Yeah.

1306
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.070
Why would you like bubbles like a straw with chocolate milk?

1307
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.330
Oh,

1308
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.330
sperm bubbles.

1309
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.540
<v 4>I have that projector screen now.</v>

1310
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.670
It sits like 130 inch TV in my living room.

1311
00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:00.020
So my,

1312
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.680
my living room now is just like couch and wall TV.

1313
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.330
That's awesome.

1314
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.630
That's really awesome.

1315
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.660
That's like the full interview old one was humongous.

1316
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.110
No,

1317
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.950
this is like that.

1318
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.650
If that whole wall is just a TV,

1319
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.100
<v 0>yours is bigger than the one that I used to have at my house.</v>

1320
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:14.521
<v 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1321
00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:14.671
yeah,

1322
00:34:14.671 --> 00:34:14.910
yeah.

1323
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:15.211
It's,

1324
00:34:15.211 --> 00:34:16.080
it's like movies,

1325
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.910
like small movie theater is turn your head back and forth in order to know you

1326
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.210
just kind of feel like you're in the movie.

1327
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.120
I had a point,

1328
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.210
but I can,

1329
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.210
oh,

1330
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:24.510
sorry.

1331
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.600
Hey watched blueray porn on it.

1332
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.140
Uh,

1333
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.640
and it was so disturbing because not only was the vagina taller than me by in

1334
00:34:32.641 --> 00:34:33.474
real life,

1335
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.350
but it was just like every single little detail like freckle and they're like,

1336
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.840
it looked like there was like some yellow stuff coming out.

1337
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.460
Oh wait.

1338
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.710
Would you freeze framed and walked up to it?

1339
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.191
No,

1340
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:44.640
I never did.

1341
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.473
I just speak.

1342
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.430
<v 0>He came out of vagina bigger than him.</v>

1343
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:51.303
Oh.

1344
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:52.303
Oh.

1345
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.273
Oh.

1346
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.490
<v 4>Taking pictures of yourself.</v>

1347
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.950
Have you not taken pictures of stuff that's next to a giant vagina?

1348
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.370
Uh,

1349
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.960
not yet.

1350
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.470
I should be doing that immediately.

1351
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:03.590
Dude inches is pretty fucking big and it's really disturbing.

1352
00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:04.424
Watching like,

1353
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.900
like violent porn,

1354
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.371
like asa,

1355
00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:06.670
Akira.

1356
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.470
It's not like that cause that's just like so hard core,

1357
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.430
so big.

1358
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.190
It gives you like heart palpitations.

1359
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.040
<v 0>I'm really not into that shit.</v>

1360
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.290
I'm not into that hardcore stuff at all or I'm not in the hurting.

1361
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.510
I'm not into watching like violent porn,

1362
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:22.961
like,

1363
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:25.000
like the hurting people slapping people,

1364
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.710
gagging them and shit like that.

1365
00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:28.240
Like I don't get that.

1366
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.110
You know,

1367
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.580
I see plenty of violence.

1368
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.130
I don't connect violence and sex.

1369
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.060
No,

1370
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.350
nobody sees more violence than me are right there.

1371
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.080
It's pretty,

1372
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.140
it's pretty rare that a human being in all of history.

1373
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:42.690
It seems more guys get the fuck beat out of him than me.

1374
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:43.320
Yeah.

1375
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.170
And I've seen a lot of violence and a,

1376
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.250
I don't like it in my porn.

1377
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.110
Yeah,

1378
00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:48.560
I like it.

1379
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.131
All I know for,

1380
00:35:49.131 --> 00:35:49.570
you know,

1381
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:53.490
I liked head kicks inside the octagon or the Moitai ring.

1382
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.400
I do not like some of them get more with head kicks.

1383
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:57.234
Are there?

1384
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.931
Sure there is.

1385
00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:59.520
That'd be like another list of porn.

1386
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.050
There's some more than one.

1387
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.200
There's one that Tyler Knight Fund and everybody that was on the podcast at one

1388
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:04.890
point in time,

1389
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.870
if you just watched Jujitsu at half speed,

1390
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:07.704
it's pretty hot.

1391
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.220
I don't think that's the point he was talking about.

1392
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.590
I think he's talking about guys and girls,

1393
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.020
but what they did was a,

1394
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.140
these guys fought,

1395
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.200
they fought it out and the winner got to fuck the girls.

1396
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.030
They had like real fights.

1397
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:24.870
Yeah.

1398
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:25.211
Yeah.

1399
00:36:25.211 --> 00:36:26.970
Dude's got an organization called,

1400
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.750
well,

1401
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.140
um,

1402
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.441
I don't know.

1403
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:29.071
They made it out,

1404
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:29.311
man.

1405
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:30.240
It's some fucking porn.

1406
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.180
But what often was this dude Aaron Brink,

1407
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.200
who was a,

1408
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.020
an MMA guy who turned to porn and started,

1409
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.140
but so he's like a real fighter and so he'd beat the shit out of Tyler.

1410
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.273
Wow.

1411
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.780
I don't know what Tyler agreed to that.

1412
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.330
He's crazy though.

1413
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:46.830
Tyler is going to fuck that girl.

1414
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.560
Tyler had like a boxing match with Mario Lopez.

1415
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.190
You got to fuck right after you win a match.

1416
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.341
Well,

1417
00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:53.671
I don't know.

1418
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:56.430
Maybe they give you a little break and John,

1419
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.170
seriously.

1420
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.410
Well,

1421
00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:02.160
if the girl's hot horny and you get a quick Kao maybe we pumped up matches the

1422
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:03.390
spoils of your victory.

1423
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.590
You look at live in like,

1424
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:04.771
yeah,

1425
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:08.310
but people have to watch and the put camera in your face and shit get all kinds

1426
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:08.950
of,

1427
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:09.511
well you're coming.

1428
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:12.330
There's other men in the room staring at you and you're like,

1429
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.260
guys,

1430
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.590
come on,

1431
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.423
let me shower.

1432
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:16.860
Are you in here?

1433
00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:17.910
Why don't I do this?

1434
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.590
Yeah.

1435
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.160
I did some web video once a day.

1436
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.460
I was in a porno like academy.

1437
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.720
It'll learn how to be a porno guy and know that it was,

1438
00:37:25.721 --> 00:37:29.100
it was like a parody and that slave from um,

1439
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.680
from four at apple or at Bruno,

1440
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.750
the little slave he had in the beginning.

1441
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:34.650
I didn't see Bruno.

1442
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.573
Oh really?

1443
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:36.930
Wow.

1444
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.830
How could you never see it?

1445
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:38.251
I used to.

1446
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.160
I saw you love Boris.

1447
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.490
Yeah,

1448
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:39.681
no,

1449
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:40.920
I did love Bora.

1450
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.550
I haven't,

1451
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.383
I have it on DVD.

1452
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.740
I do that sometimes with movies.

1453
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:44.120
I'm like,

1454
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.341
man,

1455
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:47.160
I just never have ever took me forever to see tropical funder,

1456
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:48.180
but I fucking loved it.

1457
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.980
Took me forever to see.

1458
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.630
It took me years like any bravo it.

1459
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:52.470
So you haven't seen it yet?

1460
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.550
You still haven't fucking seen yet.

1461
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.091
I'm like,

1462
00:37:54.091 --> 00:37:54.271
dude,

1463
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:54.871
I haven't seen it yet.

1464
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:55.411
You got to see it,

1465
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:55.561
man.

1466
00:37:55.561 --> 00:38:00.210
You gotta see you gotta see you gotta start the painting the alien ship?

1467
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:00.601
No,

1468
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:00.810
no,

1469
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:00.991
no,

1470
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:01.141
no,

1471
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:01.321
no.

1472
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:04.010
It was a inside a hanger and um,

1473
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.080
they were all walking up to one of their ships inside the hangar and it's fake

1474
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:10.951
as fuck.

1475
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:11.970
It was hilarious.

1476
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.800
I was,

1477
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.650
I paused it.

1478
00:38:13.651 --> 00:38:14.100
I was like,

1479
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.600
that looks like your shit.

1480
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.640
Wow.

1481
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.211
Yeah.

1482
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:20.910
The dinosaurs from drastic park look bad on HD.

1483
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.750
Oh,

1484
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.650
did you think so?

1485
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:23.280
Yeah,

1486
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.210
I didn't think so.

1487
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.740
I,

1488
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.021
well,

1489
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:26.850
I only saw the t rex film,

1490
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.290
the t rex footage.

1491
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.790
I was flipping through it the other night.

1492
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.540
I was,

1493
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:30.930
yeah,

1494
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.760
the t rex when it first came over,

1495
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:34.510
that fence know Goddamn.

1496
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.470
That was a great scene.

1497
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.010
That was one of

1498
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.410
<v 1>the greatest monster movie scenes ever.</v>

1499
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.200
When they realize that the electric fence was off.

1500
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.430
Oh fuck.

1501
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.790
And then they heard that thing stone.

1502
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.200
When you see the glass,

1503
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.030
like the wiggle and the glass when the thing started

1504
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.970
and then it comes over the fucking Tom was like what the driving away from it?

1505
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.260
It's running after them.

1506
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.880
God dammit.

1507
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.480
Who just told they don't think that t rex really moved that fast.

1508
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.080
Really?

1509
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.570
Yeah.

1510
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:05.780
They,

1511
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.240
the new speculation I think is that t rex is more of a scavenger than anything.

1512
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.380
Oh really?

1513
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.960
Yeah.

1514
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.490
They speculate.

1515
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.000
Even speculate that t rex might have had vulture like coloring,

1516
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:22.601
you know,

1517
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:24.700
cause we don't have any idea what their coloring was.

1518
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.601
True coloring.

1519
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:28.840
We just kind of guess they could be,

1520
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.231
you know,

1521
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:30.520
like look at like some of the,

1522
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.200
the variation in lizards.

1523
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:32.981
It's amazing.

1524
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:34.260
So your fancy swapped together.

1525
00:39:34.261 --> 00:39:38.200
I have video of the t rex has with different types of coloring to the song.

1526
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:39.610
True colors by Cyndi Lauper.

1527
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.650
I see a slow down in Jujitsu.

1528
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.000
It's bye.

1529
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.833
Bye.

1530
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.650
I need to find out what this,

1531
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.630
what these photos of this fucking t rex looked like because I'm pretty sure that

1532
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:53.070
they,

1533
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.870
they believe that t rex was a scavenger.

1534
00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.640
Tate just told me about some tee shirt that showed the t rex doing pushups and

1535
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:01.474
it's just,

1536
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.871
yeah,

1537
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:02.081
no,

1538
00:40:02.081 --> 00:40:02.980
it's a t rex.

1539
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.180
It's on Facebook.

1540
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.720
He said,

1541
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:04.980
oh,

1542
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.591
it's like a photo.

1543
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.940
Let's go around the t rex.

1544
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:11.941
His face as his nose is touching the ground arms can't just push a ridiculous t

1545
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.061
rex.

1546
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:16.450
Cavender look like while we're looking this up,

1547
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.580
why don't you take an opportunity to go get my new special,

1548
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:20.710
passive aggressive and where can they get it?

1549
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.450
Could they get it already?

1550
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.283
The great.com.

1551
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.081
You can find a link there.

1552
00:40:23.081 --> 00:40:26.980
That banner right@thetoporyoucangostraighttochill.com slash Ari Shaffir do you

1553
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:27.540
have a foe?

1554
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:27.910
Um,

1555
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:28.743
a um,

1556
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.441
uh,

1557
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:29.771
on your,

1558
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:30.450
what do you have Ari?

1559
00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.140
shaffir.com is the website as well.

1560
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.770
Yeah.

1561
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.760
So you all that it doesn't change her same place or vice versa.

1562
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.211
Yeah.

1563
00:40:37.211 --> 00:40:37.511
See,

1564
00:40:37.511 --> 00:40:38.021
this is,

1565
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.854
um,

1566
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.130
the new images of t rex.

1567
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.190
They wanted him to be.

1568
00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:43.930
They think he's more likely read.

1569
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.070
Oh,

1570
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:45.970
like a vulture.

1571
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.670
This is like some scientists speculation.

1572
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.680
Well I saw it though.

1573
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.550
Um,

1574
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.850
some scientists have speculated this whether they're right or not.

1575
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:55.391
Wow.

1576
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:58.380
Who's trying to find out some new stuff about dinosaurs?

1577
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:02.230
There's dudes that are obsessed with dinosaurs and then they are completely

1578
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:03.064
obsessed.

1579
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.390
They think Jurassic Park is like,

1580
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:06.160
they're all time like bone movie.

1581
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.390
Oh yeah.

1582
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:12.690
But you know the really issuing important the real issue with like a something

1583
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:14.350
like a Jurassic Park.

1584
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:14.700
Yeah.

1585
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.480
Is that seems like something we would do.

1586
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.290
Oh yeah.

1587
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.130
It really does.

1588
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.350
I think we should do that would be amazing.

1589
00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:25.450
Well the only reason why I say yes is because you see Erc that Apache helicopter

1590
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:27.370
footage and shit they can do with those things now.

1591
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.580
The dinosaurs would be fucked if we really want to Jack,

1592
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.440
we just fly around churches,

1593
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.601
judge,

1594
00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:32.811
judge,

1595
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:33.644
judge g,

1596
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.100
we'd cut

1597
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.020
<v 0>those bitches out of the sky like it was nothing.</v>

1598
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:40.790
Just make a few t rex is cut their balls off when they're babies make a few

1599
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.153
can't breathe.

1600
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.910
The electricity's not going to go off.

1601
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.520
You end up getting four or five generators and even if it does,

1602
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:48.080
we just make a bomb and drop it on them.

1603
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.980
Yeah.

1604
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.220
With a glider people died.

1605
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:50.830
He have a,

1606
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:51.591
I have a couple of years,

1607
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:54.830
I'm sure maybe more people die from hammers than guns.

1608
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:55.230
All right.

1609
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.790
Yeah,

1610
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.500
I've heard that.

1611
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:56.930
Yeah,

1612
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.530
a lot more.

1613
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.610
Uh,

1614
00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.270
hundreds of more.

1615
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:59.760
Don't people die from hammers,

1616
00:41:59.761 --> 00:42:02.600
them cons or is there a very effective way to kill people that are close to you?

1617
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.101
They're right there.

1618
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:04.934
If they're near you,

1619
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.410
you can whack them with a hammer,

1620
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.200
with a backside to whatever side you're going to kill him.

1621
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:10.070
I'm not trying to be polite.

1622
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.250
I wouldn't use the claw if I was going to kill you with a hammer.

1623
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.400
I just let you know right now I would only use the flat part cause it seems like

1624
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.210
a gentlemanly thing.

1625
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.600
How many,

1626
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.700
how many of those do you think are people just trying to hit somebody over the

1627
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:20.900
head with a hammer and knock them out?

1628
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.290
Most of them like prompt them and then realizing as soon as you hit like,

1629
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:24.690
oh,

1630
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:28.970
Skillcrush most murders are murderers on purpose and I'm trying to kill you.

1631
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.010
Half of them were done by Mc Hammer.

1632
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.580
You think so?

1633
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.930
Do you guys think you've ever kill somebody?

1634
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.940
What could you under certain circumstances,

1635
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.110
what do you don't think you could?

1636
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:39.290
No,

1637
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.123
I think I could.

1638
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.850
Of course you could.

1639
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.683
Yeah,

1640
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.110
I could see.

1641
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.660
I totally do.

1642
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.250
It's been very pretty much proven that human beings can kill human beings under

1643
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:47.200
the right circumstances.

1644
00:42:47.201 --> 00:42:48.034
It's not kill me.

1645
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:49.941
Fuck Eddie.

1646
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:51.950
Brian Bell to you should be able to,

1647
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.380
if,

1648
00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.180
if it's,

1649
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.013
if you have to,

1650
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.750
I mean it's not something that you would want to do in life,

1651
00:42:56.751 --> 00:43:00.560
but say if you were with a girl and all of a sudden some guy attacked the girl,

1652
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.660
it was kind of good as going to kill her.

1653
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.060
Wouldn't you attack him and tried to kill him?

1654
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:07.760
You would try to save your friend or would you run away like a little girl?

1655
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:10.590
I just pissed all over your pants and scream and tried to call the cops and not

1656
00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:11.310
to intervene,

1657
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.000
but could be.

1658
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.170
It could be that how can happen if a guy was trying to beat your girl up and

1659
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:18.260
you're absolutely sure you can kick his ass and you have the bat in your hand

1660
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.290
and you're like club that go over the head with a bat,

1661
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:21.890
right?

1662
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.723
Yeah.

1663
00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.690
And if he died,

1664
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.890
you would have killed him.

1665
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:25.580
Yeah.

1666
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.000
Yeah.

1667
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.420
Right.

1668
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.280
So you're very capable of killing a person.

1669
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.750
Somebody.

1670
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.930
Where can we have the greatest game of all though?

1671
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.130
The real problem,

1672
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.510
Ari killing people is that it's a power issue and the real power is,

1673
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.360
it's not that like logically you shouldn't kill some people.

1674
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.950
The only logical reason to kill people as the people that are doing something

1675
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.260
really awful to the human race,

1676
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:50.800
whether it's pedophilia or whether it's murder,

1677
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.381
whether it's,

1678
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:52.214
you know,

1679
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:53.030
there's,

1680
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.510
you know,

1681
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:58.070
fill in the blank with whatever horrific crime against humanity.

1682
00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.300
Those people,

1683
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.990
there's a very good argument for removing them from society.

1684
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.490
But then the problem becomes like,

1685
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:05.450
who gets to choose?

1686
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:07.520
And that's what he killed his genital assays from.

1687
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.031
Oh yeah.

1688
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:08.430
Well,

1689
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.770
you know,

1690
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.330
people kill for a lot of kill for robberies.

1691
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.680
The kill for a lot of reasons.

1692
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.543
Yeah.

1693
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.310
I knew a dude who killed a girl from,

1694
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:16.530
uh,

1695
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.630
killed a guy from money.

1696
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.460
Do you think you killed somebody?

1697
00:44:19.461 --> 00:44:21.540
If they were just going to find out you were doing something and you were going

1698
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:22.460
to buy them living,

1699
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:24.290
you are going to have to go to jail for 20 years,

1700
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.240
you know,

1701
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.270
you probably shouldn't have done what the fuck we'll put you in jail.

1702
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:28.520
I know.

1703
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.360
Definitely shutting off,

1704
00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:30.440
but here we are.

1705
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.340
It depends what kind of a person he is.

1706
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.821
He looked,

1707
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:35.010
he looked kinda like a little bit chubby.

1708
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.720
Kind of looked like he had a snarky face.

1709
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:38.250
Undercover cops kill him.

1710
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.280
But your job tell him on the rocks,

1711
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.170
like do anything wrong.

1712
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:46.700
But he just looks like of you wouldn't like Surratt is around.

1713
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:48.990
What does that,

1714
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.620
what does that say?

1715
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.390
I don't know.

1716
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.940
Snitch.

1717
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.140
Oh,

1718
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.410
it was a Donnie Brasco fuck.

1719
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:53.244
I don't remember.

1720
00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:54.740
Get their pages.

1721
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.420
Snitches get their bitches.

1722
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.080
No,

1723
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:00.913
Brian,

1724
00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.150
he's just a gang of people

1725
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.310
snitching and be like this when you're 55.

1726
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.130
I'm really curious all that.

1727
00:45:10.131 --> 00:45:10.964
I uh,

1728
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.810
you chose this life that shows when you're 55,

1729
00:45:17.811 --> 00:45:20.340
you could act like a 30 year old son.

1730
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.280
We're going to move up to that quickly.

1731
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.080
That was thinking about him.

1732
00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:26.000
His normal time live 17 years.

1733
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:26.240
Yeah,

1734
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.760
but if you looked at her all and did it in dog years,

1735
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:30.343
about eight.

1736
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:31.921
You really,

1737
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:33.240
you just have a Martin low,

1738
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.290
slow moving.

1739
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.360
Progeria that's what you've got.

1740
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.550
Just really slow at that.

1741
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:41.680
Your body is withered away while you're inside.

1742
00:45:41.681 --> 00:45:42.540
Just still 14.

1743
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:42.910
No,

1744
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:46.530
he's 38 and it looks like he's 25 looks pretty young.

1745
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.181
He's 38 years old.

1746
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:48.960
Look at his face.

1747
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.220
I was fairly young Logan.

1748
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.200
I don't know people who look like he does.

1749
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:53.034
He looks young.

1750
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.490
He looks very good for,

1751
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:55.980
for 25 years old.

1752
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.023
Puffy,

1753
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.863
puffy.

1754
00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:58.410
Yeah.

1755
00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.260
Slept on cat hair.

1756
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.390
The kid got in shabby.

1757
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:01.280
Be handsome with spark.

1758
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.250
Got Good unique genes as far as keeping his face together.

1759
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:05.700
Yeah.

1760
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.360
It's not bad.

1761
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.193
Look good with a beard,

1762
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.870
but the reality is he's emotionally eight years old,

1763
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.070
but it's works.

1764
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:14.730
It works.

1765
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:15.210
You know?

1766
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.880
I mean like who's to say how you should live this life?

1767
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.470
It's fucking,

1768
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:19.290
I'll do it.

1769
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.020
It's temporary.

1770
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:20.400
Oreo.

1771
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.233
Right.

1772
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.440
Who are wondering totally down.

1773
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.410
It's you start with you that we should start with you and examine,

1774
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.080
examine your,

1775
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.630
your behavior at the Tsa.

1776
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.660
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1777
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.210
All right.

1778
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.310
I heard that you won't take off your shoes now,

1779
00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:35.260
which is something that you'd never did with me.

1780
00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:36.090
I that I remember.

1781
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:36.761
That's something new.

1782
00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:37.450
And think of it,

1783
00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.700
I've been set free by my association with other people.

1784
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:40.803
What happens?

1785
00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:41.560
What are you doing?

1786
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.331
Your association,

1787
00:46:42.331 --> 00:46:43.430
but not Brendan.

1788
00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:43.580
Uh,

1789
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:43.901
Brent.

1790
00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:44.360
Why Bach?

1791
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.430
He's such a Germaphobe.

1792
00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.960
He can't take off his shoes.

1793
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:47.380
Right.

1794
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.970
And I flew with him to San Francisco.

1795
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.051
I was like,

1796
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:50.791
how do you not do it?

1797
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.820
Because I have a medical condition.

1798
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.560
What's [inaudible] position?

1799
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.041
He goes,

1800
00:46:54.041 --> 00:46:54.641
if they ask,

1801
00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:55.840
I just say something in Latin.

1802
00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.350
I just say a couple of Latin syllables and they say fine,

1803
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.150
but they're not supposed to ask.

1804
00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:01.691
I was like,

1805
00:47:01.691 --> 00:47:02.710
and then you don't have to take his shoes off.

1806
00:47:02.711 --> 00:47:02.921
He goes,

1807
00:47:02.921 --> 00:47:03.160
no,

1808
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.690
they just have to like swap it a little bit.

1809
00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:04.991
And then,

1810
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:05.824
um,

1811
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:06.800
and then uh,

1812
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.120
he goes,

1813
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.620
I like them patting me down to them.

1814
00:47:08.621 --> 00:47:10.030
I like the way it feels like a hug.

1815
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.840
That's an important one box.

1816
00:47:11.841 --> 00:47:15.950
That creepy son of a bitch give me say that.

1817
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.520
That's why he's doing it.

1818
00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.020
He might sit a little hug.

1819
00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:20.431
<v 0>No,</v>

1820
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:20.680
no.

1821
00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.513
What do you want us to do?

1822
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.300
He wants to complain and he gets Super Shitty with these people.

1823
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:25.630
Yeah.

1824
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.750
So he got super shitty with the one guy in,

1825
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:28.110
in,

1826
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.020
in La.

1827
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.040
But that guy was pretty

1828
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.873
<v 1>easy going,</v>

1829
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:31.440
but then he got it

1830
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.390
<v 5>depends what they say.</v>

1831
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:32.941
I said,

1832
00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:33.540
I can't do it.

1833
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.350
Medical condition.

1834
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:34.680
Okay,

1835
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.250
go this way.

1836
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:35.700
Okay.

1837
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.300
If they say,

1838
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.170
are you opting out?

1839
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:37.860
That was hard.

1840
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.820
I don't know what that means.

1841
00:47:38.821 --> 00:47:39.121
When I say,

1842
00:47:39.121 --> 00:47:40.690
do you not want that or do you want to pat down?

1843
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:40.951
And I go,

1844
00:47:40.951 --> 00:47:41.191
no,

1845
00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.150
I don't want to pat down,

1846
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.170
but I'm not doing that thing.

1847
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:44.460
So what are my options?

1848
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.840
He's just trying to be Larry David.

1849
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:46.081
No,

1850
00:47:46.081 --> 00:47:50.100
I'm just trying to not let them take away these freedoms from me without going

1851
00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:51.180
down with a little bit of a fight.

1852
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.320
I see what they're doing.

1853
00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.650
They're just harassing us and I don't want to just let them do it.

1854
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.570
They're not harassed.

1855
00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.131
We can hold out.

1856
00:47:57.131 --> 00:47:59.370
We can go back to what the fuck I was doing,

1857
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:00.420
but what we'll do,

1858
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:00.751
<v 1>no,</v>

1859
00:48:00.751 --> 00:48:04.080
let's go back to it all originates from this.

1860
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.340
It originates from this,

1861
00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:05.641
this,

1862
00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:08.130
this opinion that you have that they're harassing you.

1863
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.720
They're just bothering everyone.

1864
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.490
It's just some giant bureaucracy.

1865
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:12.181
Right.

1866
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:14.320
But don't run efficiently in a lad.

1867
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.250
A lot of issues with planes and terrorism.

1868
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:17.581
I mean,

1869
00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:18.680
they really have theirs.

1870
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.110
We're really wasn't an asshole.

1871
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.390
Try to lay shoe on fire.

1872
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:22.680
There was a there,

1873
00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:24.510
there really was a got through the CSA.

1874
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:25.230
Yeah.

1875
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.640
And the shoe bomber who got through Tsa.

1876
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.881
Yeah.

1877
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:28.800
That's why they started taking your shoes off.

1878
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:29.903
They caught,

1879
00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.230
uh,

1880
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.063
I don't know.

1881
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.700
<v 5>It's in the range of zero people caught anybody.</v>

1882
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.111
No,

1883
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:35.591
they haven't.

1884
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:38.050
They show all these weapons they've confiscated and stuff,

1885
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:38.884
knives and such.

1886
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.400
That's just,

1887
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.990
I got one confiscated from me before.

1888
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.440
They said,

1889
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.521
well,

1890
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:42.281
it's all I keep telling you,

1891
00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:43.114
forget about it.

1892
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.520
That's what they confiscate.

1893
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.343
Nobody,

1894
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.980
they caught somebody on as much as I can.

1895
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.200
They caught somebody recently that I remembered.

1896
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.680
Uh,

1897
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.980
that was like a whole plot to take down a plane and stuff like that.

1898
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.110
Elegance probably stops them.

1899
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.601
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1900
00:48:59.601 --> 00:49:00.101
I think that's,

1901
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:00.310
you're,

1902
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.930
you're confusing the FBI and the CIA.

1903
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.311
But CSA,

1904
00:49:04.311 --> 00:49:06.380
dia is Central Intelligence Agency.

1905
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.860
That's just a large crooked organization mostly to deal with foreign shit.

1906
00:49:09.861 --> 00:49:10.161
Right.

1907
00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:13.160
And they just see AI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1908
00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:13.890
Is that how it works?

1909
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:14.350
<v 5>I don't remember.</v>

1910
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:14.621
All right.

1911
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:15.191
Don't you think?

1912
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:15.911
Maybe just like,

1913
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:16.210
Hey,

1914
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:19.060
I'll just take off my shoes and walk through his machine and go like this and

1915
00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:19.601
that's cool.

1916
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:20.290
I'm done.

1917
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.920
And instead of having to deal with it and,

1918
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.430
and just be an asshole to somebody that's just doing their job.

1919
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:24.791
Absolutely.

1920
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:24.881
Well,

1921
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:25.151
hold on.

1922
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:25.890
Let me back up on,

1923
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:26.131
on,

1924
00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:26.290
uh,

1925
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.940
let me get back to someone's just doing their job.

1926
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:28.660
But yes,

1927
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.110
it is.

1928
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.050
It would be way easier just to kick off my shoes and go through it and be quiet.

1929
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:34.660
But I saw it one day I was on a POC Cokie obviously,

1930
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:35.890
and I was looking at them.

1931
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.950
I like an hour to my plane took off and I was looking at them just stopping

1932
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:39.461
everyone in.

1933
00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:41.540
Each and every person having to go through that scanner,

1934
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.221
the old scanner,

1935
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:44.460
we had to raise your hand and now again the new scanner,

1936
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:45.303
you have to raise your hand.

1937
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.170
It looks like they're conditioning us there.

1938
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:49.620
<v 1>Sorry,</v>

1939
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.371
who are they?

1940
00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:50.880
If they,

1941
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.680
if they found the states government,

1942
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:56.720
if they found a guy with his fucking shoe or the bomb packed and they shoe and

1943
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.770
that guy could have been on an airplane.

1944
00:49:58.771 --> 00:50:02.460
If they don't check and on someone goes in with a bomb in a fucking shoe and

1945
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:03.570
blows you out of the sky,

1946
00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:04.980
then what?

1947
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.813
Yeah,

1948
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:06.803
that's

1949
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:08.040
current.

1950
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.850
Do you not think that there's a deterrent for bringing a board bombs and bring a

1951
00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:15.690
board really dangerous shit on that could take down a plane like checking

1952
00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:16.524
people's bags

1953
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.140
<v 5>and you're not allowed to say you walk on that plane loads the Turner.</v>

1954
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.053
It's okay.

1955
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.880
But that doesn't excuse that.

1956
00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:25.620
This is not the right way to do it.

1957
00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:26.120
Detroit.

1958
00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.391
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1959
00:50:26.391 --> 00:50:28.370
How do you think they should check your bag?

1960
00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:29.060
<v 0>Um,</v>

1961
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:29.893
I think they should.

1962
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.281
Yeah,

1963
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:31.611
maybe.

1964
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:32.090
I don't know.

1965
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:32.721
I have no idea.

1966
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:33.110
Yeah,

1967
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:33.950
but I will tell you this,

1968
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:34.784
that I have read this.

1969
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:38.210
Those things don't even check for those types of explosives.

1970
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.650
The X rays.

1971
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.951
Yes,

1972
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:40.490
I do.

1973
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.151
The X rays.

1974
00:50:41.151 --> 00:50:41.391
Yes,

1975
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:43.850
they do x rays tests for plastic explosives.

1976
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:47.390
[inaudible] got a very unique way it looks,

1977
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:50.870
it looks like a big brick of clay and if you have c four,

1978
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:53.090
if you have anything and it looks remotely like that,

1979
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:54.470
they do a secondary check.

1980
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.140
You know you for you to say maybe no reason.

1981
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.641
No,

1982
00:50:57.641 --> 00:50:57.750
no.

1983
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.460
There is a reason.

1984
00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.160
There's a deterrent.

1985
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.310
I just don't think they're organized in any way.

1986
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:04.010
And I don't like the word because there are people,

1987
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.611
the check points,

1988
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:08.060
this is with the 65,000 corrupt people,

1989
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.170
corruptible people corruptible,

1990
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.600
but they're also just people that are there for a job that exists because

1991
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:18.740
there's a need and the need is to make sure that people don't go on planes with

1992
00:51:18.741 --> 00:51:22.760
fucking bombs because people are crazy ass holes and a lot of people are willing

1993
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:25.490
to do something like that and blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people

1994
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:28.070
because it's terrorism and become,

1995
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:29.360
it scares the fuck out of people.

1996
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.970
And because it has a lot of value politically,

1997
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:35.600
obviously more throws a lot of value to blow people out of the sky.

1998
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.061
You know,

1999
00:51:36.061 --> 00:51:37.010
you want to prove your point,

2000
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:37.510
you know,

2001
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.610
they will never end well then you have to be checked.

2002
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:44.060
But I don't think we have to give up our civil liberties in order to stop.

2003
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:44.900
Um,

2004
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.100
what may happen,

2005
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.670
Ari,

2006
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.250
you're not giving it the able to delivery.

2007
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:49.370
You're getting checked.

2008
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.070
You're making sure that your,

2009
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:51.351
yeah,

2010
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:55.400
when they were able to do search for then and then they found out and did it.

2011
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:56.660
And did some shit.

2012
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:58.100
X Rays loosens people up.

2013
00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.001
There's a bunch of said,

2014
00:51:59.001 --> 00:51:59.241
okay,

2015
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:01.930
we have to stop that now let's be a little bit more stringent.

2016
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:02.890
Diplo,

2017
00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.690
the people who were in nine 11 and flew fucking planes into the towers,

2018
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.120
Jack the,

2019
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.911
they didn't blow it up,

2020
00:52:07.911 --> 00:52:08.744
but they hijack the planet.

2021
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.290
Okay.

2022
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.400
One of them blew up,

2023
00:52:10.401 --> 00:52:12.950
but they think that I was actually the United States government that blue,

2024
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:15.680
that fucker from this guy flight 93 instead of went down.

2025
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.221
Yeah,

2026
00:52:16.221 --> 00:52:16.821
we'll actually,

2027
00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:20.240
Rumsfeld said it was shot was Rumsfeld or one of them said it was,

2028
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.870
I believe it was Roosevelt said it was shot from the sky and then corrects

2029
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.580
himself.

2030
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.413
Yeah.

2031
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.020
Shot that fucking thing down.

2032
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:27.730
They,

2033
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.161
they,

2034
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:32.270
they even had the eye witnesses who saw a military jet scrambling after that

2035
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:32.600
plan.

2036
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.840
Have you seen them fucking harass people in wheelchairs?

2037
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:36.171
Yeah.

2038
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:36.441
You know,

2039
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:39.020
why are you seeing the of why are shit left and right?

2040
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:44.000
They are just people and you get a wide variety with people.

2041
00:52:44.001 --> 00:52:46.490
You get competent people and you get income trained.

2042
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.810
They're not trained well.

2043
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:49.580
Well for them to be in charge of you.

2044
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:50.503
I agree.

2045
00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.860
Get statement.

2046
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.410
They make 50 50 an hour.

2047
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.040
They're not true.

2048
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.140
There's no training process.

2049
00:52:56.141 --> 00:52:57.320
Whether it's so small.

2050
00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.401
That's not like a cop.

2051
00:52:58.401 --> 00:52:59.270
We got to go through a whole,

2052
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:00.830
I've researched it a little bit.

2053
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.331
I agree.

2054
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:03.290
Don't they don't have them.

2055
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:04.770
They don't have like any firearm training.

2056
00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.500
There's nothing they do like a police officer does.

2057
00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:07.040
They don't.

2058
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.900
They don't really know what the code is.

2059
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.450
They never,

2060
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:10.640
none of them agree at all.

2061
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:11.450
Well,

2062
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.140
you know why?

2063
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.150
Because there's no people and here's why.

2064
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:16.850
It's a giant bureaucracy and at this point that came out,

2065
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:17.361
pare it down.

2066
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:18.560
They cannot make it more efficient.

2067
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:24.690
But a bunch of people that's working that's just running checkpoints on other

2068
00:53:25.521 --> 00:53:26.110
people.

2069
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:26.330
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2070
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:26.720
but he,

2071
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.520
that's his job if you don't like,

2072
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:29.331
but they don't like it.

2073
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:31.460
You don't attack the boys.

2074
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.510
You do.

2075
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.260
Here's why.

2076
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.770
Just because someone's paying you to do something does not excuse that behavior.

2077
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.753
Good or bad,

2078
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.900
this case or another case,

2079
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.770
but someone paying you to do something is not an excuse for behavior.

2080
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:44.480
Whether no matter what it is,

2081
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.410
<v 0>I think we're dealing with some Holocaust share here.</v>

2082
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.360
<v 5>Yes.</v>

2083
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.890
I mean you don't want to jump straight to that,

2084
00:53:48.891 --> 00:53:50.630
but let's just say it was something else.

2085
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.321
Yeah,

2086
00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:51.951
absolutely.

2087
00:53:51.951 --> 00:53:53.330
It looks exactly like that.

2088
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.340
Why are we raising our hands?

2089
00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.260
Why are we taking shit off?

2090
00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.140
Because they're checking you for bomber underwear.

2091
00:54:00.141 --> 00:54:02.960
Bombs again is trapping you for that.

2092
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.950
That's what the fucking radar thing

2093
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.911
<v 0>for whatever it's called.</v>

2094
00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:06.744
The X ray thing.

2095
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:07.650
Ari.

2096
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.510
That's why they're checking you better

2097
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.790
when you're going through the screen about the x rays,

2098
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.850
but they used to use and they sometimes use that use to use what?

2099
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:18.684
X Rays.

2100
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.400
The X rays.

2101
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.340
The the box.

2102
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:21.660
The same thing you're talking about.

2103
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:23.730
Well those have more radiation.

2104
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.031
No,

2105
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:24.150
no,

2106
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.581
but what?

2107
00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:25.031
What happened?

2108
00:54:25.031 --> 00:54:25.621
But they still use them.

2109
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:29.010
Sometimes they started using this other thing because it's a visual imagery.

2110
00:54:29.011 --> 00:54:29.761
It works better.

2111
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:31.920
You can actually see where the prominent issue is.

2112
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.480
If someone's wearing a vest or something like that and the vast isn't metal and

2113
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:37.890
you go through a metal detector.

2114
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:38.100
Right.

2115
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.431
Hold on.

2116
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:40.200
What if the vest is in metal?

2117
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:40.530
Look,

2118
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.550
my watch doesn't go off in metal detectors.

2119
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:42.900
Yeah.

2120
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:43.400
Okay.

2121
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.730
Looking at all it's metal go right through my weapon actors.

2122
00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:48.490
It's a battle,

2123
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.240
a fucking bomb and a switch isn't a weapon either.

2124
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:56.450
If you have a bomb and a switch on you likely it would be easier for you to go

2125
00:54:56.551 --> 00:55:00.120
through a metal detector that it would go through one of those scanner things.

2126
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.770
When you're holding your hands up,

2127
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.960
they could see if you have gum wrappers in your pocket.

2128
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.530
Okay.

2129
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.340
It's no joke.

2130
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:05.611
Those,

2131
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:07.140
those machines are incredible.

2132
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.970
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:09.980
I had a dime and it told me,

2134
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:10.371
he's like,

2135
00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:11.091
you have something to write pop.

2136
00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:11.271
I'm like,

2137
00:55:11.271 --> 00:55:12.060
no.

2138
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:12.410
I'm like,

2139
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:13.041
Oh yeah,

2140
00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:14.090
there's a little diamond there.

2141
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:14.600
Yeah.

2142
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.550
I had pills in my pocket pocket

2143
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:16.420
<v 0>once and they said,</v>

2144
00:55:16.421 --> 00:55:16.540
uh,

2145
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.141
what's in your pocket?

2146
00:55:17.141 --> 00:55:18.130
And I was like something and they said,

2147
00:55:18.131 --> 00:55:18.600
take it out.

2148
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:18.851
I was like,

2149
00:55:18.851 --> 00:55:19.684
no,

2150
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.040
what are you supposed to take it out?

2151
00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:23.110
So they know that you don't have anything that could blow.

2152
00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:24.490
I have pills in my pocket.

2153
00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:26.470
I can boner pills in my pocket.

2154
00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.290
I didn't feel like taking them out in front of everyone.

2155
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:28.930
At the airport.

2156
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:31.060
You know that giving up these,

2157
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:31.390
yeah.

2158
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:32.740
You know that's what you had in your pocket.

2159
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.150
What if you had a stick of c four and what have you sat in fucking exit door and

2160
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:38.500
blow your fucking brains out?

2161
00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:42.790
I punched a hole in the plan and they're not catching anyone doing those things.

2162
00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.660
I don't know that.

2163
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:44.830
And I don't think you know that either.

2164
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.750
They're not catching anyone doing those things.

2165
00:55:46.751 --> 00:55:47.650
Here's the deal.

2166
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.610
The deal citing national security concerns and TSA will not point to any

2167
00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:56.020
specific cases in which a screener stopped a would be terrorist at a checkpoint.

2168
00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:56.231
You know,

2169
00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:58.810
they don't need that to check us for the liquids anymore.

2170
00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:00.610
You can just pretty much carry through.

2171
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.013
Why did you do that?

2172
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.160
Cause I think I there,

2173
00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.000
there,

2174
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.590
there the techs are thing that the belt either recognizes it,

2175
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.450
they have the technology to do that or they'd no longer think that's a

2176
00:56:10.451 --> 00:56:11.260
threatened anyway.

2177
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.210
I don't think three years ago.

2178
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.300
I think unless they're using some other equipment,

2179
00:56:16.301 --> 00:56:16.511
I don't know.

2180
00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:19.150
See how you could see what they can do it.

2181
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.130
The old guy who ran the Tsa said that,

2182
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:21.700
oh,

2183
00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:22.990
but because it's hard to,

2184
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.190
the guy who used

2185
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.840
<v 2>to be the head of the TSA set it</v>

2186
00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:28.380
<v 0>and so he's going to completely discount what he said.</v>

2187
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.590
Well I didn't know what you're talking about.

2188
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:30.990
You're the old guy who ran the TSA.

2189
00:56:30.991 --> 00:56:32.310
I thought you were talking about somebody you met.

2190
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:32.670
Okay.

2191
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.820
I didn't know you met the guy who ran the head of the CSI.

2192
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.720
Sad that what three years ago.

2193
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.160
What was the exact quote?

2194
00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.590
I don't have the exact quote in my head.

2195
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.000
Well do,

2196
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.490
what is the exact statement?

2197
00:56:41.491 --> 00:56:46.080
Is he saying that you can detect regular the thing when they send your bag

2198
00:56:46.081 --> 00:56:48.270
through they can just detect explosive liquids

2199
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:49.221
<v 2>or,</v>

2200
00:56:49.221 --> 00:56:50.054
and the other one,

2201
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.730
so you don't need that anymore.

2202
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.750
It's a visual.

2203
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:54.470
But he goes,

2204
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:55.250
it's too,

2205
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.510
too much work to change it.

2206
00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:01.540
So no one's bothered to change it because it's such a big corporation of 65,000

2207
00:57:03.021 --> 00:57:04.160
employees as army has,

2208
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:05.743
um,

2209
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.613
uh,

2210
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.030
that they just won't change it.

2211
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.223
Right.

2212
00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:10.550
Ah,

2213
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:10.941
so again,

2214
00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:13.570
we just can't do stuff and they have the excuse.

2215
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:13.851
I was like,

2216
00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:13.971
well,

2217
00:57:13.971 --> 00:57:14.511
if you don't like it,

2218
00:57:14.511 --> 00:57:14.931
don't fly.

2219
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.210
Or You make some statement like,

2220
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:18.290
well you know,

2221
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.510
planes are flying out of the sky,

2222
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:21.860
they're blowing up planes left to right.

2223
00:57:21.861 --> 00:57:23.360
You don't want planes being blown up to you.

2224
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:28.010
So if you're in favor of any sort of like these guys are taking it too far,

2225
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.890
then you're in favor of planes blowing up,

2226
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.163
which is not the case.

2227
00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:32.571
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2228
00:57:32.571 --> 00:57:34.070
But they actually have busted people.

2229
00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:37.220
It turns out they busted a guy named Kevin Brown,

2230
00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:39.780
a US army veteran who was uh,

2231
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.340
trying to check luggage containing pipe bombs.

2232
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:44.871
It's crazy.

2233
00:57:44.871 --> 00:57:48.740
Motherfucker had pipe bomb making materials and his luggage,

2234
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.390
it was trying to put together a pipe bomb.

2235
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:52.130
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2236
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.621
it was recent,

2237
00:57:52.621 --> 00:57:53.454
right?

2238
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:54.570
Yeah,

2239
00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:54.990
he wasn't,

2240
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.950
he was just trying to check it.

2241
00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:56.761
Yeah,

2242
00:57:56.761 --> 00:57:58.060
he was checking a pipe bomb.

2243
00:57:59.310 --> 00:57:59.700
I mean,

2244
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:00.361
imagine if did,

2245
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:01.860
they didn't have that security though.

2246
00:58:01.861 --> 00:58:04.710
And especially with all the recent school shootings and shit like that.

2247
00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:07.050
It seems like if they got rid of it,

2248
00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.130
we,

2249
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:09.240
it would just open up.

2250
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:10.720
You don't care for more on it.

2251
00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:11.910
Definitely go back to the old way.

2252
00:58:11.911 --> 00:58:14.070
And you definitely got to lock the cockpit door and tell him,

2253
00:58:14.071 --> 00:58:15.420
I'm waving in front of your own way.

2254
00:58:15.421 --> 00:58:16.111
What is the issue?

2255
00:58:16.111 --> 00:58:16.600
What issue?

2256
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.910
What would we do in two thousand two thousand what'd we do there for security?

2257
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:21.461
<v 0>Well,</v>

2258
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:22.151
whatever they did,

2259
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:24.070
it didn't work to the tech box cutters.

2260
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:24.460
Yeah.

2261
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:28.270
So we should figure out what they're doing now that's different and then figure

2262
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.650
out if you really want to criticize it,

2263
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.770
what it is is it's a

2264
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:36.850
<v 2>checking people for bombs and for things that are going to try to kill people on</v>

2265
00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:37.840
a plane and take down a plane.

2266
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.700
That's fine box cutters,

2267
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.140
but they've proven over again.

2268
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.040
You can get those on now.

2269
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.930
We still got those wrong over and over again is through component,

2270
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:49.670
<v 0>but that's not the fault of the people that have arranged that.</v>

2271
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:52.060
<v 2>I'm saying it doesn't really work for what would have happened.</v>

2272
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.980
What would have worked is locked the cockpit door.

2273
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:54.750
Right.

2274
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:55.250
Then that day.

2275
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.290
Then they do that now.

2276
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:57.100
Oh yeah.

2277
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.120
That's a new thing they've learned.

2278
00:58:58.121 --> 00:58:58.390
Yeah.

2279
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.200
For the most part,

2280
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.750
that's probably [inaudible] nine 11 when they did it there.

2281
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:06.190
So you agree that they have to check your bags to make sure you don't have

2282
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:07.024
bombs.

2283
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:07.923
They check something.

2284
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:08.651
Okay,

2285
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:11.590
so what do you have a problem with specifically that you get so riled up to

2286
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:15.160
65,000 person army that has control over us.

2287
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.930
That can tell you come with me.

2288
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:19.450
Open up that let everyone look at you.

2289
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:20.463
They can,

2290
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:21.800
they can push

2291
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.540
<v 5>people that have no legs,</v>

2292
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.500
they can,

2293
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:29.030
they can embarrass old ladies and we have to do what they say.

2294
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:31.850
They can steal our belongings and we have to do what they say.

2295
00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:35.680
And there's just an untrained random dudes that are doing that,

2296
00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.190
that are making us raise our hand.

2297
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:39.020
Like we're under arrest and I just don't like it.

2298
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:39.883
I don't like it.

2299
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:41.211
It's just gross.

2300
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:41.961
The whole thing has growth.

2301
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:42.800
No one likes it.

2302
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.090
No one goes there and goes,

2303
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:45.440
thank God these guys are doing their job.

2304
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.080
We reacted under under a time of intense,

2305
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:51.770
intense emotion where we didn't really have time to think it out and now we

2306
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:54.470
already have all these things in place and we can't rethink what the TSA is.

2307
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:57.680
<v 0>Wasn't there checks before.</v>

2308
00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:59.960
You'd have to check your luggage through a radar detector.

2309
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:00.380
Yeah.

2310
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:00.800
Yeah.

2311
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.461
Or whatever it's called.

2312
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:02.031
Not write about tech.

2313
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:02.750
The X ray.

2314
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.081
Yeah,

2315
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:04.160
they've always checked it.

2316
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.500
What specifically is the issue?

2317
01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:07.610
The pat downs,

2318
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.590
the um,

2319
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.250
they only pat dial if you opt out.

2320
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.110
I don't get patted down.

2321
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.800
I've never had a problem with anything.

2322
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.720
I fly right through the security.

2323
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:16.130
I'm in and out and gone.

2324
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:19.670
It's like why even bother making that harder or more like,

2325
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:21.980
especially if you had some weed on you or something ridiculous,

2326
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.140
like why can't I mean fake weed but a fuck are you doing?

2327
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:27.470
They just,

2328
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.110
they're just a bunch of people you put up with like forties.

2329
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:30.650
Yes.

2330
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:31.910
But I think that's the issue.

2331
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:34.580
Whenever you have people that are in any sort of position,

2332
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:36.620
it becomes a job.

2333
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:37.161
Whatever it is,

2334
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:37.790
it needs to be done.

2335
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.400
Say it needs to be you gotta you gotta Guard,

2336
01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:42.020
but the Guy Leans are coming in because there's a fucking,

2337
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:44.470
this is your Barista at Starbucks with the aliens land.

2338
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.231
You gotta be ready.

2339
01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:46.700
You got to have guys that are ready to guard it.

2340
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.151
Well,

2341
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:49.100
those guys are gonna fuck off their guys.

2342
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:50.300
Normal people.

2343
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.950
No matter what you do,

2344
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:56.550
you're always going to have people that poorly implement whatever strategy you

2345
01:00:56.551 --> 01:00:56.810
have.

2346
01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:57.650
Their great the TSA,

2347
01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:58.400
you,

2348
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.290
you're 100% I think they're great.

2349
01:01:00.291 --> 01:01:01.041
You're not a child.

2350
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.070
You know what I'm saying?

2351
01:01:02.071 --> 01:01:02.904
So what do you think,

2352
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.820
like why would you say that you think they're great?

2353
01:01:04.821 --> 01:01:05.540
I wouldn't say that.

2354
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.440
I know you're watching,

2355
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:07.274
forcing,

2356
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.560
forcing your opinion by exaggerating mine.

2357
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.010
No,

2358
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.500
because I want you to tell me what you think the problems are with Tsa.

2359
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.010
Okay.

2360
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.980
The problems are with Tsa.

2361
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.270
Say the same problems there are with any system where people get in any position

2362
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:18.110
of power over people,

2363
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.830
the obs automatically act like Douche bags to same as security guards.

2364
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.780
I mean the same as bouncers at clubs.

2365
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.010
It's the same as some cops.

2366
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.270
And so is he difficult thing to have that kind of power over people and not

2367
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:30.770
abuse it and not be cocky about it.

2368
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:33.860
I remember when we got to the airport and there's this one guy who was being,

2369
01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:36.620
or just really attention to Horry attention ladies,

2370
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:37.191
gentlemen,

2371
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:38.240
please get your day.

2372
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.720
It was like going through this big speech and [inaudible] and then,

2373
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.820
well I would like one more request.

2374
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.080
Everybody please smile.

2375
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:46.040
I'm like,

2376
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.930
you fucking Weirdo.

2377
01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:49.450
You just put us,

2378
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.600
show you a fuck head.

2379
01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:52.400
It's like a street performer or something.

2380
01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:53.720
I mean it was like that's what it was doing.

2381
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:57.860
Like he decided this is what he does cause everybody has to listen because he's

2382
01:01:57.861 --> 01:01:58.840
the man with the power,

2383
01:01:58.860 --> 01:01:59.750
the TSA guy.

2384
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.880
But that's just one douchey guy.

2385
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.800
I've met a million people that do it,

2386
01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:05.810
that are friendly is how he like how did you have a good time?

2387
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:05.991
Yeah,

2388
01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:06.480
it was great.

2389
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:06.930
Good.

2390
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:07.700
Enjoy Chicago.

2391
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.780
Chicago is awesome.

2392
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.381
Boom,

2393
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:09.771
you're in,

2394
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:10.281
you're out.

2395
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:13.010
Everything's fine when you're just interacting with some people that are doing

2396
01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:13.551
their job.

2397
01:02:13.551 --> 01:02:17.150
And I personally find I've never had a problem.

2398
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:17.390
I've,

2399
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.991
I've always,

2400
01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:18.950
they've always been pleasant to,

2401
01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.300
I've no one's ever got douchey

2402
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.133
<v 1>with me.</v>

2403
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:22.340
You know,

2404
01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.690
if I accidentally have my belt on,

2405
01:02:23.691 --> 01:02:26.000
I say I'm sorry and I take the belt off and I put it in the thing.

2406
01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:26.391
You know what I mean?

2407
01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:27.950
It's like your prostrate yourself for them,

2408
01:02:27.951 --> 01:02:28.221
Paul.

2409
01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:29.360
It's not prostrating.

2410
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.330
It's just being nice to people while you're doing their gig.

2411
01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.100
Their Gig doesn't bother me.

2412
01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:34.700
Okay.

2413
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.390
I don't,

2414
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.270
I don't wanna I don't wanna I'm not flying with any bombs.

2415
01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:39.530
I'm not flying with any guns,

2416
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.720
so I not worried about them checking my underwear.

2417
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:42.410
Okay.

2418
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.651
My,

2419
01:02:42.651 --> 01:02:44.000
my bag's pretty sample.

2420
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:44.541
The Go.

2421
01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:45.261
Go ahead and look in there.

2422
01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.190
There's some toothbrush.

2423
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.550
Toothpaste is no,

2424
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.890
there's nothing to worry about,

2425
01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.251
you know,

2426
01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:51.260
so as long as there's nothing to worry about,

2427
01:02:51.261 --> 01:02:52.430
you sail right through.

2428
01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.940
Do I think that logic,

2429
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.190
they could tap your phone if you're a law abiding,

2430
01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:58.520
no,

2431
01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.290
that it's not the same logic.

2432
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.330
Jesus Christ your underwear.

2433
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.080
Because tapping your phone and listen to intimate conversations.

2434
01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.400
Find out aspects of your life that you wouldn't want revealed or find out where

2435
01:03:10.401 --> 01:03:11.151
you live,

2436
01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:11.990
what you're doing,

2437
01:03:11.991 --> 01:03:13.250
what your plans are.

2438
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.920
That's not the same thing as checking for them,

2439
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:17.690
but under those circumstances sort of,

2440
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:20.320
it's just that looking at intimate parts of your life and they can look,

2441
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.160
looking at clothes.

2442
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.660
I mean unless you got a bag of Dildos,

2443
01:03:23.661 --> 01:03:25.130
which by the way Stan hope did,

2444
01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:29.120
but if you're in the closet and you actually a purpose brought a bag of fucking,

2445
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:34.170
after September 11th I had a whole suitcase filled with rubber fists and rubber

2446
01:03:35.751 --> 01:03:40.751
vaginas and Fis and decks and just everything and he just sent it through the x

2447
01:03:41.691 --> 01:03:44.750
ray so that if they had to like open it up and check it and it's like,

2448
01:03:44.751 --> 01:03:45.230
yeah,

2449
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.441
yeah,

2450
01:03:45.441 --> 01:03:46.274
that's my stuff.

2451
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.311
<v 5>Are you,</v>

2452
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:51.020
if you go to the Burbank and say turned to one of them on something like that.

2453
01:03:51.021 --> 01:03:52.150
So they had to find which one it was.

2454
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:53.763
What I was saying.

2455
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.860
Yeah.

2456
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.980
If you go to the Burbank airport,

2457
01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:59.230
almost every single person that works there,

2458
01:03:59.231 --> 01:04:02.140
the staff of the people that check check you.

2459
01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:03.910
I've never had one problem.

2460
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.110
Those are the most friendliest,

2461
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.330
nicest ever just doing their job.

2462
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.990
Aren't you scared from being such an Asshole,

2463
01:04:10.991 --> 01:04:12.520
I guess is what you would call it.

2464
01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.570
These people to get on some kind of no fly list,

2465
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.150
especially since you're a comic and half of your job,

2466
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.450
there's no fly list and here's where that fear comes from.

2467
01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:25.510
Them holding over you that if you cause too much trouble for us,

2468
01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.410
we're gonna threaten you to fear that you will no longer be allowed to fly.

2469
01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:30.460
That's a real thought,

2470
01:04:30.461 --> 01:04:31.230
but people have,

2471
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.481
right?

2472
01:04:31.481 --> 01:04:32.320
You're not the first one.

2473
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.770
Right.

2474
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.390
And stop terrorism.

2475
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.120
They are that to help them stop terrorism,

2476
01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.690
but be someone would put like someone like me or someone who mouths off too much

2477
01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:45.691
on a no fly list that would help us stop terrorism to make people live in fear,

2478
01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.740
<v 1>but they might decide that you make things very uncomfortable and unpleasant for</v>

2479
01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:53.620
a lot of people around you as well when you're at the airport because you were

2480
01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:55.190
yelling out that.

2481
01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.860
<v 5>Do a lot of people just scared to say it on,</v>

2482
01:04:57.861 --> 01:04:58.190
on,

2483
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.840
on podcast too or anything like that,

2484
01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:03.160
just for the sake of put you on no fly list.

2485
01:05:03.161 --> 01:05:03.530
Yeah.

2486
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.060
That's a real thought people have.

2487
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.510
Oh,

2488
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.800
they can just do this to you.

2489
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:07.750
They can,

2490
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:10.760
they can grab your ability to fly in the dark,

2491
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:13.340
like a fucking gulag and just take you out of there.

2492
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:13.821
All right.

2493
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:16.820
My friend is so scared to fly that she has to take.

2494
01:05:16.821 --> 01:05:18.190
So drugs just

2495
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 4>to calm her heart rate down just enough so she can even be there.</v>

2496
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.390
If you start like being intense to where she will freak out.

2497
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.900
You know,

2498
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.700
if you were to be intense around her,

2499
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.230
she might go crazy.

2500
01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.120
<v 0>That's when I was in intensive that Dennis will be the same thing.</v>

2501
01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:32.580
Yeah.

2502
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.210
Yeah.

2503
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:34.170
She's on my responsibility.

2504
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.220
<v 4>But Frank's a big,</v>

2505
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:36.791
yeah,

2506
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:38.560
but flying is a big deal for a lot of people.

2507
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:38.801
I mean,

2508
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:39.760
my mom's scared to fly.

2509
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:41.080
I know a lot of people that are just doing that.

2510
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:45.520
Bert Kreischer gets blackout drunk before he flies with blackout drunk.

2511
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:47.680
She made him go to the movies.

2512
01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.100
Well,

2513
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.120
some get fucked up.

2514
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.541
Well,

2515
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:50.800
he's also scared of balloons,

2516
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:51.130
Joe.

2517
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:52.090
Oh,

2518
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:53.590
you gotta fucking balloon.

2519
01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:54.521
Jesus Christ.

2520
01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:55.354
Where's the booze?

2521
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.151
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:05:58.151 --> 01:05:59.410
Bird Christ is used to that shit.

2523
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:00.280
And this is excused.

2524
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.250
He's away from his wife and kids got no responsibilities going to get hammered

2525
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.620
on a plane and there's nothing wrong with that bird.

2526
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:06.490
Just fess up,

2527
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.190
fess up with your anxiety ridden.

2528
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:11.140
Here's the,

2529
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.580
I don't mind taking the shoes off.

2530
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:13.900
It's not that it's just there.

2531
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.860
They're being there.

2532
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:15.970
I don't like I,

2533
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:16.870
you know what?

2534
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.070
I think they're necessary.

2535
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.200
I think at this point in our reality,

2536
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:21.580
I wish they weren't necessary.

2537
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.440
I wish I didn't have to believe,

2538
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:28.060
and I'm not necessarily saying that it has to be run the way it's run.

2539
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:28.480
I know.

2540
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.340
I don't think it's efficient,

2541
01:06:30.341 --> 01:06:31.720
but I don't think that anything's efficient.

2542
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.100
You know what else isn't deficient?

2543
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.550
The DMV do you go to the DMV when you go to get your fucking license?

2544
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:37.384
Just starts screaming.

2545
01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.520
I was for those who want a fucking car.

2546
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.960
I don't want to Julie your bullshit.

2547
01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:42.420
It was a corrupt organization,

2548
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:43.990
but I can get their license online.

2549
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:45.070
I don't have to come in contact with them.

2550
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.473
Can you really?

2551
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.433
Yeah.

2552
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:48.730
You can renew it online now.

2553
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:48.890
Yeah.

2554
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.920
Why not go in there and take a photo or anything.

2555
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:51.610
That's beautiful.

2556
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:51.761
Well,

2557
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.750
you know there's a thing you could do at the TSA or you get preapproved and when

2558
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:56.561
you get preapproved,

2559
01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:57.700
you don't even take your shoes off.

2560
01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:00.580
You just go right through because we fly a lot and they assume you wouldn't be.

2561
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:00.880
No,

2562
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.900
they do a check on you.

2563
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.450
They do a check to make sure you're not some fucking psycho.

2564
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.070
Yeah,

2565
01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:05.321
no,

2566
01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.890
not make sure he never got arrested at the airport for harassment with Tsa.

2567
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.450
I thought you were going to get arrested.

2568
01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.070
Well,

2569
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.880
Ari wouldn't be a rough yelling at them because you're yelling at people like

2570
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:15.590
it's said illegal swearing.

2571
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:15.761
Yes.

2572
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:17.170
I'm calling them idiots.

2573
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.580
Yeah.

2574
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:17.830
Yeah.

2575
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.030
He was calling the fucking idiots.

2576
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.020
Why is that illegal Brody and going out though?

2577
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:24.010
He did threaten to bring over the cops on me.

2578
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:24.341
Well,

2579
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:24.941
this is what I said,

2580
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.220
that the TSA is trained authority over him.

2581
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:27.610
He said,

2582
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.760
I'll bring over metropolitan security officer or police officer.

2583
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:31.570
That's what they do.

2584
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.300
If I say the arrest you,

2585
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.070
the other people arrest you.

2586
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:39.100
What they're worried about is that you are being aggressive and they thought

2587
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:40.330
that you could have been a crazy person.

2588
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.730
[inaudible] they drove me crazy.

2589
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.870
Right,

2590
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.550
but the way you reacted to it,

2591
01:07:45.551 --> 01:07:49.180
it's like seven and ones a little scared violation.

2592
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.571
No,

2593
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:50.140
I'm not scared.

2594
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.370
Don't you think that's a little weird that everyone's scared of being put on

2595
01:07:52.371 --> 01:07:53.230
this no fly zone.

2596
01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:53.381
I'm like,

2597
01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:54.101
that's a real thought.

2598
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:56.410
Like don't piss them off or they'll put you on a no fly list.

2599
01:07:56.910 --> 01:08:01.210
Tsa and you should be worried about government corruption and anybody that puts

2600
01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:06.211
you in a government no fly list because you have espoused views that they,

2601
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.451
you know,

2602
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:09.280
they don't feel like fits the company line.

2603
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.293
That's very scary.

2604
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.190
Very scary and very dangerous,

2605
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.720
but that's not what's going on here.

2606
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:16.190
Well you need to worry company and put

2607
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.100
<v 1>on a no fly list.</v>

2608
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.410
It's just because of your behavior.

2609
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:19.911
It's just you.

2610
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:20.990
You made a scene.

2611
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.970
I'm allowed to call him an idiot all I want.

2612
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.230
It's not the way you're doing it,

2613
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:24.771
your way.

2614
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.600
You're doing it like you were like you,

2615
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:30.020
you yelled and you escalated and you made it like a big deal.

2616
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:31.500
So what are your problems with Tsa?

2617
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.690
It's not good.

2618
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:33.523
It's not efficient.

2619
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.680
It's not this crazy long dumb lines.

2620
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:40.160
It's a bunch of people running things like that guy with this stupid and one

2621
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:40.994
more thing,

2622
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.103
please smile.

2623
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:43.400
That's very annoying.

2624
01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.293
It is annoying.

2625
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:47.180
That's a person in a position of power.

2626
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:48.500
And I think those same issues.

2627
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:50.030
I think it's a problem with humanity.

2628
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:51.890
When people get into positions of power,

2629
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:53.850
they actually do feel like they have a,

2630
01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:55.100
you have to listen to them,

2631
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.820
you know?

2632
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.091
I mean,

2633
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:57.380
I've had that with bosses.

2634
01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:57.890
I've had,

2635
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.810
I mean we've all had that with teachers,

2636
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.640
but people get in a position of power.

2637
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:03.740
They act as if they have some,

2638
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.770
an alien.

2639
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.670
There's some indefensible authority over you,

2640
01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:08.751
you know,

2641
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:09.260
they're just,

2642
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.070
they're powerful and it's a natural thing.

2643
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:13.530
They started,

2644
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:13.821
well,

2645
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:15.260
that's opportunistic people.

2646
01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:16.370
That's poor people also,

2647
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.190
<v 5>they were laughing and doing naked pictures of people.</v>

2648
01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:18.750
They will laugh.

2649
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.460
They were sitting in control and he's laughing.

2650
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.240
I would too.

2651
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:21.990
You went to,

2652
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.910
they had that chance.

2653
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.340
Humor.

2654
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.030
I wouldn't have that big of job are you would probably come on those pictures.

2655
01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:27.900
I probably would.

2656
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:29.550
I wouldn't be any better.

2657
01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:30.180
Don't get me wrong.

2658
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.650
I wouldn't be better if I was in that job.

2659
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:32.340
Right.

2660
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.550
So I do the,

2661
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.730
the fucking travelers as the enemy also.

2662
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.590
I don't think it's that bad of a job.

2663
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.000
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

2664
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:40.040
I really don't harass,

2665
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:40.741
harassing people.

2666
01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:41.371
That's your job.

2667
01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:42.360
It's harass people.

2668
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.360
Because you have,

2669
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:46.410
doesn't mean it's a real thing that no one has.

2670
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.270
Obviously this.

2671
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.720
Sometimes you have people doing anything in a position of power.

2672
01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:55.410
There's a certain percentage of wrong interactions are going to take place.

2673
01:09:55.411 --> 01:09:58.350
Where I'm putting untrained people in these positions of power of it.

2674
01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.910
Why was it would cost even more

2675
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.350
<v 1>taxpayer money to train these assholes and to pay him more money and to,</v>

2676
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:07.730
to to go and get more qualified,

2677
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.240
more socially advanced people for the job.

2678
01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:11.391
I mean,

2679
01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:11.901
what are you going to do?

2680
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:12.734
Where are you gonna get him?

2681
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:13.940
You're getting people.

2682
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:16.370
A lot of these people that work for the TSA,

2683
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:17.780
there's not a lot of other jobs,

2684
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:18.880
you know,

2685
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.440
and that's what the issue is like they have to take this job.

2686
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:22.340
It's not a bad job.

2687
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.020
What do you want?

2688
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.480
<v 5>They can't get rid of the can't downsize it now they're unable to.</v>

2689
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:26.591
And is that what it is?

2690
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:27.880
If it could be 5,000 employees,

2691
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.560
it would make a tremendous dent.

2692
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.680
You would see the mark on the on time or not necessarily

2693
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:34.390
<v 1>to downsize it.</v>

2694
01:10:34.391 --> 01:10:34.960
They they,

2695
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.960
they need to make it more efficient and it would be nice if people were more

2696
01:10:37.961 --> 01:10:38.441
pleasant,

2697
01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:38.711
hostile,

2698
01:10:38.711 --> 01:10:39.544
we privatized.

2699
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.181
That's a,

2700
01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:41.450
that's an issue with human being.

2701
01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:44.220
Maybe prioritize it even if they privatized it,

2702
01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:44.330
man,

2703
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.440
to be even creepier because then it would be some fucking giant corporation

2704
01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:48.760
instead of something that government,

2705
01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:49.530
that's what it was before.

2706
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.460
Let's see what airlines would hire people.

2707
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:52.090
Yeah.

2708
01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:53.380
I Dunno if that's good or bad.

2709
01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:54.250
I really don't know.

2710
01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.240
But what I do know is that you know your,

2711
01:10:58.241 --> 01:10:59.980
your anger about it,

2712
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.530
it's going to get you in trouble.

2713
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.800
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2714
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.010
You were people doing their email.

2715
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.873
That's scary.

2716
01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:06.661
That's crazy.

2717
01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:07.920
You should not scream at anyone,

2718
01:11:07.921 --> 01:11:08.400
man.

2719
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.233
He goes,

2720
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.450
that's putting out bad.

2721
01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:11.170
Anyway,

2722
01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:14.440
I'm calling roll with my supervisor and the supervisor comes over.

2723
01:11:14.441 --> 01:11:14.770
He goes,

2724
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:15.603
oh great.

2725
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:16.200
He goes,

2726
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.510
the head idiot and this corrupt organization and he goes fuck

2727
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:21.181
<v 1>doing.</v>

2728
01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:22.014
What do you want?

2729
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.580
Like he's like talking to him like that.

2730
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.650
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2731
01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:25.230
What if he was,

2732
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.940
I don't like them in a fan of yours.

2733
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.480
That would have nothing to do with my feelings.

2734
01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:32.550
I thought your uh,

2735
01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:33.960
your comedy CD online.

2736
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:34.794
It was really

2737
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.930
punching nuns.

2738
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:37.380
Cool.

2739
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.610
Cause he said he was a fan of mine.

2740
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:40.560
Doesn't have any awesome just doing my job.

2741
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:40.951
I know,

2742
01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:43.190
but I've already told you I don't have,

2743
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.660
I have a job above that.

2744
01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:47.760
You need to really care this much about it.

2745
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.950
You need to fight the guy that's in charge of all,

2746
01:11:49.951 --> 01:11:51.300
it's not that they implied that.

2747
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:55.260
They're just trying to tell everybody that the head of the TSA,

2748
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:59.280
the guy who ran the TSA is the guy who owned the company that made those

2749
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.660
scanners that we don't use anymore.

2750
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.531
He was the one who said,

2751
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:02.550
we need those scanners.

2752
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:03.810
And then he sold to himself.

2753
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.370
So the head of this company,

2754
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.373
did you sure about that?

2755
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:07.920
Yeah,

2756
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.810
he was the former head went to this,

2757
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:12.060
he got the contract opened up,

2758
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.120
spent all this money that we use for two years and got rid of now the one that

2759
01:12:15.121 --> 01:12:16.230
was wasn't fully tested,

2760
01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:20.170
I guess he made billions and billions.

2761
01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:20.990
So much money.

2762
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.840
How much is one of those things?

2763
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:22.500
Costs,

2764
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.130
how much?

2765
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.330
I don't know how many dollars.

2766
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:25.500
More than 70 bucks.

2767
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.390
And they have them everywhere.

2768
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:28.770
And the only reason we had,

2769
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:29.640
and we didn't even invent,

2770
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.320
we didn't invent this time that somebody who was like,

2771
01:12:31.321 --> 01:12:31.471
oh,

2772
01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:32.370
somebody tried to get through,

2773
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:32.911
so we need this.

2774
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:33.450
He just said,

2775
01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:33.690
yeah,

2776
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.070
we need it now for no reason.

2777
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.210
And now he has to be.

2778
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:37.043
That's just from this

2779
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:38.023
<v 1>start,</v>

2780
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.250
TSA director,

2781
01:12:40.251 --> 01:12:41.540
Michael Chertoff.

2782
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:41.761
Yeah,

2783
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:42.594
that's his name.

2784
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:44.510
Body scanning company.

2785
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.180
So he's the former director.

2786
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.420
So he left and started a business that makes these body scanners and then sold

2787
01:12:53.211 --> 01:12:54.620
them to the Tsa,

2788
01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:55.371
like the TSA,

2789
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.690
how to buy his business.

2790
01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.270
So that sounds like some fuckery for sure.

2791
01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.133
Yeah.

2792
01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.770
So all this money's AV advocacy for the technology dates.

2793
01:13:03.771 --> 01:13:08.480
Back to his time in the Bush administration in 2005 homeland security ordered

2794
01:13:08.481 --> 01:13:10.460
the government's first batch of the scanners,

2795
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.550
five from the California based rapid scan systems.

2796
01:13:13.551 --> 01:13:13.971
Today,

2797
01:13:13.971 --> 01:13:17.030
40 body scanners are in 19 airports.

2798
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.433
Listen to this.

2799
01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:23.710
The TSA purchased 150 machines from them with $25 million in American recovery

2800
01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:26.450
and reinvestment act funds.

2801
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.340
So in this summer when you know there's like,

2802
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.911
Oh man,

2803
01:13:31.911 --> 01:13:33.380
we got to bring this economy back.

2804
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.740
Number one,

2805
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.520
they're throwing all that money back and vet the jobs they made.

2806
01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.180
They,

2807
01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:43.180
they threw $25 million at this cunt and his stupid fucking scanning machines.

2808
01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.191
If yeah,

2809
01:13:46.191 --> 01:13:47.900
if you had to choose between that going money,

2810
01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:52.610
going to that or men money going to mental health and you know,

2811
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:56.420
education when he 5 million nutrition for schoolkids,

2812
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:57.890
fuck you.

2813
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.570
<v 5>I just think you should find it on a larger scale than attacking poor employees</v>

2814
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.420
of Burbank airport or lax airport.

2815
01:14:05.421 --> 01:14:07.190
You know that when they're just trying to do their job.

2816
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:07.510
I mean,

2817
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.140
I already told you I don't respect that.

2818
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:11.000
Just trying to do my job argument in any,

2819
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:11.980
that's not

2820
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.791
<v 0>an excuse for it.</v>

2821
01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:14.350
You're making it unpleasant,

2822
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:15.760
but you're still going through it.

2823
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.860
All you're doing is making an unpleasant,

2824
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:18.080
yeah,

2825
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.540
I would like to make it unpleasant for them.

2826
01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:21.130
I don't like with l let me ask you a question.

2827
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.830
What if they would go further to get better testing,

2828
01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:24.611
even more tests.

2829
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:26.710
They give me more clear about what you have in you.

2830
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.480
Why would you want to go further?

2831
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.631
Well,

2832
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.880
they already did to get these scanners right,

2833
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:32.500
but why would they have to go further than that?

2834
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.940
It seems like we have to go that far because they didn't have scanners that

2835
01:14:35.941 --> 01:14:37.090
could see bombs.

2836
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.170
Um,

2837
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.190
I went to the,

2838
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:42.430
if you were strapped

2839
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.150
in response to anything,

2840
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.460
drugs taped to your body or you're concealing something,

2841
01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:52.240
but wouldn't it be better like a plastic weapon strip search to be the best

2842
01:14:52.241 --> 01:14:52.750
thing?

2843
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:53.560
Um,

2844
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.420
my guests strip search would be the best thing.

2845
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.020
Yeah,

2846
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.700
but so why would we not go that far?

2847
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.910
Like,

2848
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:58.680
why are they,

2849
01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.110
I'm just,

2850
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:02.020
it's sort of a slippery slope and I don't see why it's gone this far.

2851
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:03.880
And I don't know why it wouldn't go even further.

2852
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:04.121
Well,

2853
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:07.180
the only way it would go even further as if something cataclysmic happened.

2854
01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:08.123
Yeah.

2855
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.593
But the scanners,

2856
01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.480
there wasn't a result of anything happening or anything even trying to be ha to

2857
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:13.800
happen.

2858
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:13.900
No,

2859
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:14.920
but it's just more efficient.

2860
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.050
That's all it is more Joe,

2861
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.900
you still go through those old machines with his watch on every time you'd like

2862
01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:22.030
to look at this and that crazy.

2863
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:23.650
Now that doesn't happen.

2864
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.440
Yeah.

2865
01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.610
And now they know they got new iPhones.

2866
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:28.511
It,

2867
01:15:28.511 --> 01:15:30.010
it really is better technology.

2868
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.701
I mean,

2869
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:31.230
I,

2870
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:31.850
I,

2871
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:35.560
I think I made a forum post on me that maybe I didn't.

2872
01:15:35.561 --> 01:15:36.480
Maybe I said I was Kinda,

2873
01:15:36.481 --> 01:15:38.680
and I decided that wasn't a strip search to be the best technology.

2874
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:39.370
Yeah.

2875
01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.160
But we don't need that.

2876
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:40.311
Yeah.

2877
01:15:40.311 --> 01:15:41.470
But they're not doing that argue.

2878
01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:42.121
It's like you're,

2879
01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:45.640
you're arguing against them escalating past the point where they're at right

2880
01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:46.030
now.

2881
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.270
Well,

2882
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.541
but,

2883
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:49.360
but they escalated past the point where they were before and it wasn't based on

2884
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:50.200
any need.

2885
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.100
Joe Wasn't based on the need.

2886
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:53.980
That old machine with this wash on,

2887
01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:54.820
you keep telling about his watch.

2888
01:15:54.821 --> 01:15:55.654
Who cares about his wife?

2889
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:56.703
That wasn't a thing.

2890
01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.780
It's an efficient machine.

2891
01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:00.360
You can make like no good.

2892
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.110
The texture watch,

2893
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:03.003
that's fine.

2894
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.690
If it doesn't detect a bomb or a knife,

2895
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.553
that's not fine.

2896
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.240
You would need to show me an example of that time.

2897
01:16:07.241 --> 01:16:10.010
They didn't detect the Obama nice seat plastic or guns.

2898
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.600
Those radio things didn't see plastic knives that you have concealed and taped

2899
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:17.140
to your body have plastic knives that are made of this composite plastic.

2900
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:19.930
They can fucking kill you easy and they can see those now.

2901
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.890
You can see those now.

2902
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:26.260
There's a lot of shit that used to be in detectable if they can find,

2903
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:26.981
you know,

2904
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:29.620
I don't think that these things cannot detect,

2905
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.060
but our eats nuts for you.

2906
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:33.760
It's not a different experience.

2907
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.440
You put your shit down.

2908
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.450
I just talked like taking the power.

2909
01:16:37.451 --> 01:16:39.880
I just don't like they're making a step through these checkpoints.

2910
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:43.390
I don't like that they have control and there's no say but yet you go through it

2911
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.320
because you decide that what you're going to do is go through it and just annoy

2912
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:48.154
people.

2913
01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:50.470
That's very childish though.

2914
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:51.790
Well that's like a waste of energy.

2915
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.800
Kind of like the seat on the airplane.

2916
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:57.280
I don't even know what the suit in the airplane leaning back your seat on the

2917
01:16:57.281 --> 01:17:01.690
airplane when you're like yelling and kicking the back that Ari does that he

2918
01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.550
needs people see if they lean back on him and it's upset that you lean your seat

2919
01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:07.384
back.

2920
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.960
You guys still still think that

2921
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.511
<v 5>it's ridiculous.</v>

2922
01:17:10.511 --> 01:17:10.710
Yeah.

2923
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:14.790
I think it sucks that day habit so that people will use it.

2924
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.100
<v 0>There's like no space that everybody gets no science but it's already know space</v>

2925
01:17:20.101 --> 01:17:21.650
and you're trusting dealt with the other side.

2926
01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:22.050
How much,

2927
01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:23.310
how much you should be able to lean back.

2928
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:27.360
The reality is everybody has a seat and everybody sees it has a button and if he

2929
01:17:27.361 --> 01:17:30.390
does that you can do that too and everybody sort of accepts that.

2930
01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:32.460
You decide that you don't agree with it.

2931
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.450
What if per seat went back?

2932
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:34.650
What if a seat went back?

2933
01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.270
Even don't say that because it doesn't.

2934
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.173
Okay.

2935
01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.553
Less far,

2936
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:39.421
it doesn't matter.

2937
01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.070
Then you would have no reason to argue about,

2938
01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.660
here's what I'm saying.

2939
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:46.830
You are trusting Delta or American or United to tell you as a person how,

2940
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.080
how much room you could take away from the person behind you.

2941
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.570
You're not taking away that person's room.

2942
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.980
Everyone's sharing space.

2943
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:57.990
Arm Chair goes like this and the person

2944
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.190
and their chair goes like that.

2945
01:18:02.191 --> 01:18:02.790
Also,

2946
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:04.650
you've just shared space in a different way.

2947
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.830
You're not taking away anything.

2948
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.010
Sandwich the emergency.

2949
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.801
Okay,

2950
01:18:10.801 --> 01:18:11.690
so you know why I'm British.

2951
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.540
See I just to get that little extra space for their legs and back.

2952
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.590
It's not like you have to move,

2953
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.191
have you not?

2954
01:18:17.191 --> 01:18:18.024
So that means

2955
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:23.820
exit row that that person doesn't annoy potential authors should fairs.

2956
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.980
That's why you don't find pictures.

2957
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.900
I seen a picture of crumpled up with a guy.

2958
01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:30.960
Can't even use this computer because the person in front of them lean backwards.

2959
01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:31.701
<v 5>All right?</v>

2960
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:32.330
And you know what?

2961
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:33.450
That's why you go to,

2962
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.340
you wouldn't think that'd be a cool thing to do,

2963
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.650
to not lean back and take it.

2964
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:37.690
<v 0>You nailed it.</v>

2965
01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.850
If you lean back when that guy's doing that,

2966
01:18:39.851 --> 01:18:41.140
that you would no longer have that issue.

2967
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.781
<v 5>It's not,</v>

2968
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:42.560
that's not it.

2969
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.430
That's not real.

2970
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:43.760
That's,

2971
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.900
that doesn't make up for it.

2972
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.710
That's you're wrong.

2973
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:48.170
It doesn't make up for that doesn't add the same amount of space to you.

2974
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:49.250
You still can't see.

2975
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.181
Then when they're back here,

2976
01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:50.700
I've already looked.

2977
01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:50.851
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2978
01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.980
so it's a purely a laptop issue,

2979
01:18:52.981 --> 01:18:53.611
is that what you're saying?

2980
01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:55.680
Just all sorts of just comfort issue.

2981
01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:58.010
If you want to look at this

2982
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:59.540
<v 5>green or in front of you and the guy leaves back,</v>

2983
01:18:59.541 --> 01:18:59.750
you're like,

2984
01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.380
ugh.

2985
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:00.680
You know,

2986
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.340
it's annoying when people lean back and forth,

2987
01:19:02.341 --> 01:19:02.420
you,

2988
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.440
everyone gets annoyed by that.

2989
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.303
Everyone does,

2990
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:08.150
but that doesn't mean he should kick the back of their make their whole day.

2991
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.650
Horrible because honestly it's Brian.

2992
01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.140
The last time I did it was five years ago.

2993
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:12.790
Okay.

2994
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.690
Do you get annoyed every time people do it?

2995
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.120
Every time people lean back and take away that space?

2996
01:19:17.121 --> 01:19:17.391
Yes.

2997
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:18.670
I get annoyed but I don't kick.

2998
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:22.610
<v 0>Do you know that that's ridiculous though that everybody has a seat.</v>

2999
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.630
Everybody's seed has a button and everybody used that button and no one ever

3000
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:27.980
ever says,

3001
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:29.330
oh my God,

3002
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.180
I can't believe this person in front of me is reclining their chair.

3003
01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:32.600
What?

3004
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.770
No one ever says that.

3005
01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:34.220
No,

3006
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:37.220
you didn't see that Twitter responses after the last time we talked about this.

3007
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.740
What hundreds of people tagging us both saying,

3008
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:39.921
yeah,

3009
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:40.700
that Shit pisses me off.

3010
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.271
<v 5>Pisses me off.</v>

3011
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:44.090
When people leave bad poor cons to it might suck,

3012
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:47.000
but like I like when somebody leans back and I'm on my laptop,

3013
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:47.380
I'm like,

3014
01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:47.980
yeah,

3015
01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:48.970
<v 0>that's his chair,</v>

3016
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.350
but he wants to lead his chair back.

3017
01:19:50.351 --> 01:19:51.790
I don't always lean my chair back,

3018
01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.010
but as a woman too,

3019
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:56.920
I want to be able to see that you are inflicting some sort of pain on another

3020
01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:57.641
human and say,

3021
01:19:57.641 --> 01:19:59.010
I'm not going to do this right.

3022
01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:03.280
Melodramatic fuck pain on someone by reclining your chair.

3023
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.860
You are taking away the small amount of comfort they have on an too small

3024
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.640
flight.

3025
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.301
<v 5>We've been over this.</v>

3026
01:20:09.301 --> 01:20:12.570
You've agree is all I have is already too small on this.

3027
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.210
It's already too small amount of space.

3028
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:14.911
Don't say that.

3029
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:15.630
I agreed on this.

3030
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.850
We have been over this and you have agreed that it's already period.

3031
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.251
Yes.

3032
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:24.120
It's almost not enough to take some more of that away.

3033
01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:25.430
You don't see you.

3034
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.880
How can you not see that?

3035
01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:28.260
That would be hard for somebody.

3036
01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:28.770
<v 1>Ari,</v>

3037
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:32.790
there's a huge difference between how could you not see that it's better if the

3038
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:34.800
guy doesn't recline and going,

3039
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.810
that's his CD wants to recline.

3040
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.960
He wants to recline because he's more comfortable when he's sitting back.

3041
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:41.220
I don't mind.

3042
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.510
I don't really give a fuck Ari.

3043
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.710
It doesn't bother me that much,

3044
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:46.130
but I certainly don't think that I should be able to kick his fucking

3045
01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:46.620
<v 5>I.</v>

3046
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.000
That's just five years ago.

3047
01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:49.380
I did it three times ever.

3048
01:20:49.381 --> 01:20:51.390
I'm just saying I got annoyed by that stuff.

3049
01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.490
<v 1>Got Annoyed to the point with a reason why we talked about it in the first place</v>

3050
01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.210
<v 5>because I hate it because I hate,</v>

3051
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.710
I hate it's going to start kicking.

3052
01:20:57.730 --> 01:20:57.910
You know?

3053
01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:00.190
They make a device that will stop people from leaning back.

3054
01:21:00.191 --> 01:21:01.910
Now you can attach it to their chairs.

3055
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.200
You can attach it to your your tray and so people can no longer lean back.

3056
01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:06.250
It's like a break,

3057
01:21:06.251 --> 01:21:07.580
so that day Pete bill in front of you,

3058
01:21:07.581 --> 01:21:10.690
you can't lean back their marketing,

3059
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:14.910
their marketing of that purely because of Ellen's apparently it is.

3060
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.240
It's only because of the con,

3061
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:18.310
their marketing and selling a device side one of those.

3062
01:21:18.311 --> 01:21:19.140
You're a cunt.

3063
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:19.870
Yeah.

3064
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:23.650
If you buy one of those things and it's stops the guy in front of you from a

3065
01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:24.371
client whose seat,

3066
01:21:24.371 --> 01:21:25.240
I say you're a cunt.

3067
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:27.060
That's a country thinking dude.

3068
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.770
Do have you thought picture of that guy like,

3069
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.581
yeah,

3070
01:21:30.581 --> 01:21:31.560
that's not real art.

3071
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:32.970
There's no that.

3072
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.420
That's like a parody.

3073
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.500
It's pretty close.

3074
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:36.790
All right,

3075
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:37.150
awesome.

3076
01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:41.260
When I see my computer screen closed as they fucking Shane back,

3077
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.560
come on.

3078
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.820
You then just don't use your computer.

3079
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.391
Awesome.

3080
01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:47.050
No dog.

3081
01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:50.140
Certain airlines that have more room than others.

3082
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:51.070
You also know that more.

3083
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:53.050
There are certain airlines that have more room than others,

3084
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.080
like I think it's American or something like that.

3085
01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:56.831
When you lean back,

3086
01:21:56.831 --> 01:21:58.810
there's room actually where the,

3087
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:01.840
that's the most room and then there's like Delta where it's like you're almost

3088
01:22:01.841 --> 01:22:02.674
about to die.

3089
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:04.130
<v 1>Question about it.</v>

3090
01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.710
They are giving you too little space.

3091
01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:06.920
Yeah,

3092
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.970
no question about it,

3093
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.320
but I don't think that's the fault of someone who's hitting the recline button

3094
01:22:11.321 --> 01:22:12.160
on an open chair.

3095
01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:12.411
Yeah.

3096
01:22:12.411 --> 01:22:17.110
It's not his fault that they give it to little [inaudible] little straight hair.

3097
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.890
I don't have any problem with it,

3098
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.500
but for the sake of leaning right

3099
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:21.383
<v 5>back.</v>

3100
01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.320
Yeah.

3101
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:22.531
Yeah.

3102
01:22:22.531 --> 01:22:24.600
I had no problem for some people it makes them more comfortable.

3103
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.340
I,

3104
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:26.551
yeah,

3105
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:28.050
it's like a blanket of human on you.

3106
01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:30.450
Especially with the girls high and you have a girl kind of laying on your,

3107
01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:34.450
<v 1>I don't think that ever happens all of a sudden Bryson fucking penthouse</v>

3108
01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:35.284
letters.

3109
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:36.310
You just making shit up.

3110
01:22:36.311 --> 01:22:37.060
You're fuck,

3111
01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:37.660
are you doing?

3112
01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:38.493
Yeah,

3113
01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:39.600
I can't.

3114
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.640
<v 5>I mean that's what business classes for two because that's,</v>

3115
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.180
you're supposed to have more room because you have a laptop and you're actually

3116
01:22:45.181 --> 01:22:47.040
doing business where most people like myself,

3117
01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.500
at least I lay back,

3118
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.500
I sleep the whole entire flight or something like that,

3119
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:52.861
you know?

3120
01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:54.780
So you're doing business.

3121
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:56.760
You're a taller person.

3122
01:22:56.761 --> 01:22:59.580
You might want to pay the extra $20 zero videos on my computer.

3123
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:02.040
It's one 20 bucks and it's way more than 20 bucks.

3124
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:03.240
It depends a lot on reason at all.

3125
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.650
<v 1>Do you still have an iPad son when those little seven inch ones?</v>

3126
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:05.861
Yeah.

3127
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:06.010
Look

3128
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.310
<v 0>at this.</v>

3129
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:07.143
Read this bitch.

3130
01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.350
Cute little baby.

3131
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:09.420
Cute.

3132
01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.420
So easy to use.

3133
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:11.254
Look at that.

3134
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.080
Aren't you?

3135
01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.690
Buy them all over the mushroom soon.

3136
01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.310
Oh we need to do much of it.

3137
01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:17.560
Cause you're kicking people and yell at people at the airports.

3138
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:18.640
Jesus Christ.

3139
01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:20.020
Not projective.

3140
01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:20.854
That is,

3141
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.110
I don't think we need to do mushrooms.

3142
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.630
Why do we need to do mushrooms?

3143
01:23:24.631 --> 01:23:24.901
All right,

3144
01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:25.750
please explain.

3145
01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:27.200
Because I don't think it would be that,

3146
01:23:27.201 --> 01:23:27.580
that,

3147
01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:30.230
that rude to another human it once if you do them right.

3148
01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:31.093
Oh my God.

3149
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:32.650
I think you a first class.

3150
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:32.951
Okay.

3151
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:33.401
No I don't.

3152
01:23:33.401 --> 01:23:34.170
I don't either.

3153
01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.220
I don't recline on people.

3154
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:35.801
Okay.

3155
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:36.341
And by the way,

3156
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:37.720
if I did recline at people,

3157
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.280
I don't think it'd be that big of a deal.

3158
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:39.970
You don't,

3159
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:41.580
there's no zero plenty of spots.

3160
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:44.980
But I pay for that space because I don't like the issues I do.

3161
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.650
I do agree that coach tickets suck a fat Dick.

3162
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:48.291
They're there,

3163
01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:50.080
they're fucking spaces too small.

3164
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.230
So I go out of my way and pay extra money and I understand that other people

3165
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:53.771
can't afford that.

3166
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:56.050
Some people don't lean back on.

3167
01:23:56.051 --> 01:24:01.051
So most of my life I did do that and most of life I did fly coach and when I

3168
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:04.720
flood coach I would recline if I wanted to clear the people in front of me.

3169
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.810
And you said it a thousand times,

3170
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:08.263
believe

3171
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.390
Jesus fucking Christ.

3172
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:13.270
You think that we need to do mushrooms because we don't agree with you and

3173
01:24:13.271 --> 01:24:14.830
you're hyper aggressive way of kicking.

3174
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.300
I think it's,

3175
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.050
I think it's a,

3176
01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:19.150
that was pretty much him kicking people's chairs.

3177
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:22.660
But I think this is why you needed a bunch of us because it helps you find an

3178
01:24:22.661 --> 01:24:23.590
empathy with other people.

3179
01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.000
I see the empathy,

3180
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:25.320
I,

3181
01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.740
but I also see that you're,

3182
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.360
you get real aggro about shit that can be avoided and I think that if someone

3183
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:35.410
leans their chair back and I'm sitting in coach and the thing is like this and I

3184
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:36.160
can't do it anymore,

3185
01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.950
I will fucking close it and I'll pick up a book or I'll do nothing.

3186
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:42.760
I'm not going to get upset at some guy who's just using his chair function.

3187
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:44.230
It's not that big of a deal.

3188
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.020
You saying that I need to do mushrooms because I don't see the empathy and

3189
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:50.200
you're going Berserk over something you're not going to ever control is

3190
01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:51.730
ridiculous.

3191
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:53.310
The TSA agent,

3192
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.160
Ari,

3193
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.510
you're not screaming at this guy.

3194
01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.310
I don't like their jobs at all.

3195
01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:57.670
Yeah,

3196
01:24:57.670 --> 01:25:00.820
well you're not looking at them as seen the most aggravated like I in my life,

3197
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:02.050
pretty much the TSA people.

3198
01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.910
He's being really hypocritical on that.

3199
01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.690
That's it,

3200
01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:04.991
rob,

3201
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:05.201
kind of.

3202
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:06.700
So you're saying that you don't,

3203
01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.480
we don't have empathy for you getting upset because you can't use your laptop

3204
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:14.200
and these people just have a job that you don't necessarily like and they're not

3205
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:15.760
necessarily being shitty to you at all.

3206
01:25:15.761 --> 01:25:18.490
That I saw the way those people reacting to you and you were yelling at them.

3207
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:18.780
No,

3208
01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:18.850
no,

3209
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:19.140
no.

3210
01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:19.381
Stop.

3211
01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:20.380
Just not the individuals.

3212
01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:21.760
I went over this with Brendan Walsh wants,

3213
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:22.331
then he was like,

3214
01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:23.440
he made it kind of clear to me.

3215
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:25.810
It was like they just them saying,

3216
01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:26.591
you have a job.

3217
01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:28.330
It's not a reason to do anything.

3218
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.160
Obviously you could take it back to Holocaust Times.

3219
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.130
You went over it with Brendan Walsh.

3220
01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:33.430
So what we're saying makes no sense.

3221
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:33.730
No,

3222
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:33.941
no.

3223
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:35.140
He just sort of made it clear to me.

3224
01:25:35.141 --> 01:25:35.411
It was like,

3225
01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:35.711
I was like,

3226
01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:35.861
well,

3227
01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:36.251
come on man.

3228
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:37.001
They're just doing their jobs.

3229
01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:37.601
The same sort of thing.

3230
01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:38.070
But I just,

3231
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.840
I just sort of became clear trend in Washington.

3232
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:41.170
Another guy looks for problems.

3233
01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:41.650
I,

3234
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.101
I don't,

3235
01:25:42.101 --> 01:25:42.934
I don't agree.

3236
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.100
I think that these people are just doing their job.

3237
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:45.321
I know,

3238
01:25:45.321 --> 01:25:50.320
but that they would ask their job is hard didn't if they were actually being

3239
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:50.921
shitty to you.

3240
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:51.281
Yes.

3241
01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:52.730
But we're not being shitty.

3242
01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:53.231
It's not that,

3243
01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:53.890
it's not that it's,

3244
01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:57.040
I think they work for this organization that just is bad for us.

3245
01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:57.990
We don't like it.

3246
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.510
Okay.

3247
01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:01.840
But while you're there and you are interacting with them,

3248
01:26:01.841 --> 01:26:03.980
you're choosing to make things difficult.

3249
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:05.930
<v 1>It's not a difficult experience.</v>

3250
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:10.130
You're creating a difficult experience out of an experience that's not difficult

3251
01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.770
because you have a problem with the fact that they exist.

3252
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:13.130
Yeah.

3253
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:13.700
But yet,

3254
01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.610
you know they exist and yet you know you're going to interact with them.

3255
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.190
So you're choosing what you're saying.

3256
01:26:19.191 --> 01:26:20.270
And I tried this once,

3257
01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:20.970
I tried to,

3258
01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:23.360
like the first time I saw it and I looked at what they were and I was like,

3259
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.511
oh,

3260
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:23.871
they're just,

3261
01:26:23.871 --> 01:26:25.410
people make us go through checkpoints.

3262
01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:27.200
I think I thought this over and I was like,

3263
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:28.034
it's even worth,

3264
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:28.940
you know,

3265
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.870
having a problem with that.

3266
01:26:29.871 --> 01:26:30.770
Is it even worth like,

3267
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:30.981
you know,

3268
01:26:30.981 --> 01:26:32.150
getting upset at all about it.

3269
01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:33.051
But man,

3270
01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:34.580
it just sort of just bothers me.

3271
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.980
I know why you need to do mushrooms.

3272
01:26:36.981 --> 01:26:37.730
You fuckhead.

3273
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.240
Yeah,

3274
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:38.571
I will.

3275
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:39.261
So silver,

3276
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:39.681
difficult.

3277
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:40.070
Awesome.

3278
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.240
This is such a ridiculous stance to take because you're a professional comedian,

3279
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.480
you fly all the time and it's just an experience.

3280
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:48.530
It's not bad.

3281
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.620
The idea behind it behind Andy,

3282
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.650
loss of civil liberties and bedtime time,

3283
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.790
any loss of privacy.

3284
01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.211
I don't,

3285
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.890
I'm not a fan of any of that shit,

3286
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:02.360
but that's what this is a part of flying.

3287
01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.090
It's not a major issue in my opinion.

3288
01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:10.300
And when I see these aberrations that people like to point out examples of

3289
01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:11.960
things that Tsa has done,

3290
01:27:11.961 --> 01:27:13.160
like someone stole something,

3291
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.170
I absolutely think that can happen.

3292
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.990
I absolutely think that people can fuck up people.

3293
01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:20.150
Can you hire the wrong person?

3294
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:23.120
People can sneak through the net and be assholes.

3295
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.100
But in my experience with the TSA,

3296
01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:26.090
they're just people.

3297
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.640
They're just regular people and this is what they do.

3298
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.760
And I do a whole organization,

3299
01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:32.570
I say hi and they say hi back.

3300
01:27:32.571 --> 01:27:32.871
I say,

3301
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:33.411
how you doing?

3302
01:27:33.411 --> 01:27:34.191
Everything's good man.

3303
01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:34.760
How you doing?

3304
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.080
And it seems like really easy.

3305
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.530
I see a bunch of people that are just working and you know,

3306
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.890
they're trying to do their job when there's fucking thousands of people going

3307
01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:47.891
through there every day and it's trying to keep chaos and everything orderly.

3308
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.760
It's gotta be really fucking difficult.

3309
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:51.050
What do you think everyone's problem is with them?

3310
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.453
They suck.

3311
01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.180
They suck.

3312
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.360
That's during you through it.

3313
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:57.800
I always said that the papers to people that work at the TSA are often the same

3314
01:27:57.801 --> 01:27:59.300
people that work in the fast food counters.

3315
01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:00.260
They just switch roles.

3316
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:00.891
You know,

3317
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.320
like the ones at the airport,

3318
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:03.470
he used to work for Burger King.

3319
01:28:03.471 --> 01:28:04.340
Now your bomb scanning.

3320
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:05.380
How that I'm up.

3321
01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.253
You know,

3322
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.740
they're just,

3323
01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.790
they're just people with jobs,

3324
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:08.570
man.

3325
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.781
You know,

3326
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:09.980
I don't want that job.

3327
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:11.770
I'd wish that job wasn't necessarily,

3328
01:28:11.771 --> 01:28:13.760
but it seems to be necessary and someone needs to do it.

3329
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:15.050
So who the fuck is going to do it?

3330
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.291
Well,

3331
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.060
unless they're paying people 50 bucks an hour,

3332
01:28:17.061 --> 01:28:18.200
you're not going to get people that are,

3333
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:18.680
you know,

3334
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.910
that have a lot of other options.

3335
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:21.740
So they don't have that many options.

3336
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:22.880
So who are these people?

3337
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.470
These are people that are impoverished.

3338
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.390
They don't live in the best neighborhoods,

3339
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:27.650
they don't have a lot of opportunities,

3340
01:28:27.651 --> 01:28:28.340
whatever it is.

3341
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:31.180
And so those are the people that they're trying to get to be professional.

3342
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.590
Those are the people that are trying to get to represent their company.

3343
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.180
And of course it doesn't run smoothly.

3344
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:37.130
Like most human beings.

3345
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.170
You put them in a bunch of,

3346
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.340
you'd put them in a situation,

3347
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:41.240
any situation,

3348
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:45.740
and have a group of them that are in control over a massive group of people and

3349
01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:47.450
you ask them to behave orderly.

3350
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.710
Good luck with that.

3351
01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.790
Good luck with that.

3352
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.660
But my point is that when you go to the airport,

3353
01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:56.330
you know that there are going to be Tsa agents,

3354
01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:57.920
you know the whole procedure.

3355
01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:58.870
That's what are alike.

3356
01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:00.440
But there are going to be though.

3357
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:01.230
But this,

3358
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:02.160
I've had one of the guys say

3359
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:02.341
<v 0>like,</v>

3360
01:29:02.341 --> 01:29:02.641
I was like,

3361
01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:03.480
why don't we take our shoes off?

3362
01:29:03.481 --> 01:29:03.931
And he was like,

3363
01:29:03.931 --> 01:29:04.350
you got it.

3364
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.531
I'm like,

3365
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:05.110
why don't we take her shoes?

3366
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:06.150
And I was being moved me Jim,

3367
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:06.600
same way.

3368
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.250
But,

3369
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.760
um,

3370
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.720
does the answer at the end was if you don't like it,

3371
01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:10.554
don't fly.

3372
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:11.701
And I was like,

3373
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:13.730
that doesn't seem like a good enough reason.

3374
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.970
He doesn't represent the companies.

3375
01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:15.691
Just a dude.

3376
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:19.470
He's just working your some dickhead who doesn't want to take your shoes off?

3377
01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:19.741
He's like,

3378
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:21.120
I have to tell you to take your shoes off.

3379
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.110
That's my job.

3380
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:23.520
My job is when you go through here,

3381
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.140
I have to make sure he shoes don't have bombs on him.

3382
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:26.040
Please take your shoes off.

3383
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:27.600
Why do I have to go shoes off?

3384
01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:27.870
You're like,

3385
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:28.710
Oh God.

3386
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.311
He's like,

3387
01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:30.144
cause you have to,

3388
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.230
why should I say,

3389
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:31.771
yeah,

3390
01:29:31.771 --> 01:29:33.330
you should be able to see it from his point of view,

3391
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.930
your,

3392
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:37.470
your lack of empathy for them is a very hypocritical when you want people to be

3393
01:29:37.471 --> 01:29:39.250
empathetic black.

3394
01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:41.640
Well yeah.

3395
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.950
Obviously I'm totally,

3396
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.600
definitely not on exact point from my whole life,

3397
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:46.561
but this is a,

3398
01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:47.880
an unnecessary,

3399
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:48.301
yeah,

3400
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:50.040
I thought about that and I don't know,

3401
01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:50.190
it's,

3402
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:51.360
this is all new stuff for me.

3403
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:52.470
I'm trying to figure it out,

3404
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:54.330
but I don't like that the fact that the TSA is,

3405
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:56.420
they're taking away our civil liberties and I don't,

3406
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:59.310
I hate even saying the word civil liberties because it because it makes it seem

3407
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.560
like you're a really blurry about civil liberties.

3408
01:30:01.561 --> 01:30:05.760
The TSA is not a concern with you should be focusing your efforts on the

3409
01:30:05.761 --> 01:30:06.594
national defense,

3410
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:08.370
the Patriot Act.

3411
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.810
You should be focusing your,

3412
01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:10.680
your your,

3413
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:11.820
but this is the one I sent.

3414
01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:15.690
This is when I come in combination from the Obama Administration that they've,

3415
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.300
they've protocol to use drones,

3416
01:30:18.301 --> 01:30:22.280
armed drones on u s civilians and they're trying to figure out how,

3417
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.370
how to get away with that.

3418
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.930
Like drones with guns like to shoot you out of the fucking sky like that,

3419
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.970
that if you want to worry about civil liberties,

3420
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:30.804
I'm with you,

3421
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.240
but this is not one in my opinion,

3422
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:36.690
it needs the kind of attention that you're not doing it.

3423
01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:39.750
Maybe it's just that I'm not used to it yet or something.

3424
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.340
Once I've seen it,

3425
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.230
you're choosing to get upset.

3426
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:47.790
You're not being upset because someone is forcing you into a position where you

3427
01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:50.280
have to angrily react to stop them from doing it.

3428
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.730
You're choosing to turn this into an aggressive moment and it's not necessarily,

3429
01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:56.491
absolutely.

3430
01:30:56.491 --> 01:30:57.141
I was choosing to,

3431
01:30:57.141 --> 01:30:57.360
yeah,

3432
01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:02.010
but it's not necessary and I don't think even I avoid it doesn't accomplish

3433
01:31:02.011 --> 01:31:03.990
anything and makes us angry to accomplish it.

3434
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.910
But what it is is childish.

3435
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.171
It's not necessary.

3436
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:10.770
It's childish and it's negative and you you fuck up the day or the,

3437
01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:13.680
at least the experience and depending on how people are.

3438
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.460
Yeah,

3439
01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.450
that was definitely the intent.

3440
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.560
That's definitely a 10.

3441
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.221
I understand,

3442
01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:18.054
but you shouldn't,

3443
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.140
it's not necessary.

3444
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.420
I would run into those same people.

3445
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.320
You know what I'm say hi.

3446
01:31:22.321 --> 01:31:22.741
What's up?

3447
01:31:22.741 --> 01:31:23.490
How you doing?

3448
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:24.920
And Brian would run into a saint.

3449
01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.080
Yeah,

3450
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.251
yeah,

3451
01:31:25.251 --> 01:31:26.040
yeah obviously.

3452
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.630
But we both get to the same goal and one of us avoided or we all,

3453
01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.090
Brian and I avoided any conflict.

3454
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.420
Whereas you went through this stressful situation.

3455
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:37.890
If I yell at someone,

3456
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.161
okay,

3457
01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:39.600
if I get to the point of yelling at someone,

3458
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:41.280
it's because I want to kill you.

3459
01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.270
Okay.

3460
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.871
Cause you,

3461
01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:47.871
you've done something that's either horrible or you're dangerous or you're

3462
01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:52.080
threatening my health and I'm in a situation where I'm letting you know,

3463
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:53.340
like I'm yelling too.

3464
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:56.970
This shit could get crazy right now that you're not getting crazy at the

3465
01:31:56.971 --> 01:31:57.391
airport,

3466
01:31:57.391 --> 01:31:59.860
you're yelling because you know they're not going to yell back.

3467
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.330
You're yelling because you know that they're forced to act in this very

3468
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.530
politically correct.

3469
01:32:05.531 --> 01:32:06.550
And that's bullying.

3470
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.790
Yeah,

3471
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:07.291
because you're,

3472
01:32:07.291 --> 01:32:10.330
you're putting them in a position where they can't react to you the way you're

3473
01:32:10.331 --> 01:32:13.960
reacting to them go or your fucking head idiot at this fucking corrupt

3474
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:14.590
organization.

3475
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.030
But they can't talk to you like that.

3476
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.253
Me through this.

3477
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.980
Okay.

3478
01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:19.210
Because aren't they also,

3479
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.170
I'm not trying to be right here,

3480
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:25.090
but aren't they also putting us in a position of having to fucking just every

3481
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:28.030
single time we go having to like give up a little something,

3482
01:32:28.031 --> 01:32:28.960
feel a little bad.

3483
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.830
Well not the one where they hesitant check your shit,

3484
01:32:32.831 --> 01:32:34.330
but I don't feel bad.

3485
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.430
I'm telling you when I go through it,

3486
01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:37.600
I don't feel bad.

3487
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.730
I,

3488
01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:39.370
it doesn't bother is a way for him.

3489
01:32:39.371 --> 01:32:40.960
I don't have to put my trays away.

3490
01:32:40.961 --> 01:32:42.850
I could leave him there and I know that they would put them.

3491
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.770
I tried to help them out of a nice thing to do.

3492
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:49.830
I've gone off there almost every UFC when I go to the airport,

3493
01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:55.210
I talked to some dude who's a UFC fan who works there and we always have

3494
01:32:55.211 --> 01:32:56.044
conversations.

3495
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.630
Holy Shit Man.

3496
01:32:57.631 --> 01:32:58.900
But that one was crazy.

3497
01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:00.640
Like what do you think's next for George Saint Pierre?

3498
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:01.181
You know?

3499
01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:03.590
I mean obviously that's me and I'm in a different situation.

3500
01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.240
That was nice then,

3501
01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.620
but once I saw that it was like,

3502
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:06.490
this is sort of like,

3503
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:08.350
it's too much what they're doing.

3504
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.950
Okay.

3505
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.360
And once I saw that that I had more,

3506
01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:11.640
I had a lot more trouble with it.

3507
01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:13.120
Now I don't know what naked scanner,

3508
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.970
the naked scanner scanner.

3509
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.800
Just the stop your checkpoints on Hbo.

3510
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:20.730
You pulled your cock out on Hbo and you worried about that.

3511
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.250
You can go look at my Dick while you're still worried about not worrying at me.

3512
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:27.640
It's not that I'm worried about them taking the control to be able to laugh at

3513
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:28.030
me.

3514
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.870
It's just a job,

3515
01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:29.350
man.

3516
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.770
It's a,

3517
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:32.470
I don't know what I'm saying is as the group that the transportation security

3518
01:33:32.471 --> 01:33:33.100
administration,

3519
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.180
them taking that,

3520
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:35.251
taking that power.

3521
01:33:35.251 --> 01:33:37.510
So it's just because of the naked scanning.

3522
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.100
Then that was sort of all of it.

3523
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:39.821
You know,

3524
01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:43.000
that they have to look at bags to make sure that people don't have explosives.

3525
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:43.511
You know,

3526
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:44.870
the people are crazy fucks.

3527
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.660
You know when we were in Vegas,

3528
01:33:46.661 --> 01:33:48.640
do you know this weekend when we worked at Mandalay Bay,

3529
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.691
which was by the way,

3530
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:50.524
fucking awesome,

3531
01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:51.640
great time.

3532
01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.080
When we worked at that venue,

3533
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.610
they had to go through metal detectors.

3534
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.930
Who did the people,

3535
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.150
the people that came to that show.

3536
01:33:57.151 --> 01:33:57.550
Yeah.

3537
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.701
Yeah.

3538
01:33:57.701 --> 01:33:58.930
When you go to Mandalay Bay,

3539
01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.860
you go through metal detectors.

3540
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.020
It's not cause Vegas wants to take away your civil liberties.

3541
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:02.650
Okay.

3542
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:03.910
It's cause he didn't want anybody to get hurt.

3543
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.070
They want to make sure that,

3544
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:06.551
you know,

3545
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:07.720
maybe we should grab knives with.

3546
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:09.910
Maybe it's a fucking Ted Nugent concert.

3547
01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:11.470
Do you want to bring their own bows and arrows?

3548
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.813
He can't.

3549
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:13.421
He can't.

3550
01:34:13.421 --> 01:34:13.900
Vegas of,

3551
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.280
okay.

3552
01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:14.771
Hey,

3553
01:34:14.771 --> 01:34:15.670
what are you doing with arrows?

3554
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.271
Oh Man,

3555
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:16.750
I don't even know.

3556
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:21.370
I think it's just because of the lines that here's what I think in large groups

3557
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.270
of humans that makes me mad or I'm,

3558
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:23.620
yeah,

3559
01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.040
I think,

3560
01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.750
I think it's very stupid if I me and you fly almost every week that we have to

3561
01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:31.480
wait in the same line as this woman that's never flown out.

3562
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:33.610
When you're doing well you don't in a way.

3563
01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:34.890
But at TSA appreciate it.

3564
01:34:34.891 --> 01:34:35.360
You could do that.

3565
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.193
I never really go.

3566
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:37.060
Yeah,

3567
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.130
I'm saying that you can do that.

3568
01:34:38.131 --> 01:34:38.920
No I can't.

3569
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.490
Why not?

3570
01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:40.210
Try it.

3571
01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:41.070
You can know.

3572
01:34:41.071 --> 01:34:41.680
What do you mean?

3573
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.513
It's not everybody.

3574
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:43.930
Did you try to sign up online?

3575
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.680
Uh Huh.

3576
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.513
What'd they say?

3577
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:46.720
They won't accept you client.

3578
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.190
Really?

3579
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.653
It's not everybody.

3580
01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.890
It's not like I'm a flyer.

3581
01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:52.660
I can just get checked waiting on it.

3582
01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.513
That's just what people,

3583
01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:54.580
no,

3584
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:54.731
no,

3585
01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:55.030
no.

3586
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:57.380
Almost everybody I know that works for the UFC goes that.

3587
01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:58.730
What did they decline you on?

3588
01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:01.280
What do you mean when they,

3589
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:02.930
when you ask say pre,

3590
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.930
so what you're saying is you went through the security,

3591
01:35:05.931 --> 01:35:08.180
the pre security screening thing online.

3592
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.520
It's Tsa for lady told me to do it.

3593
01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:15.320
So you gave in your information and they just decided to decline you?

3594
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.333
Yeah.

3595
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.570
When did this happen?

3596
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.090
Three months ago.

3597
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.110
When was I in DC.

3598
01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

3599
01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:22.500
<v 0>It was a,</v>

3600
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.333
it was uh,

3601
01:35:23.610 --> 01:35:24.720
it was at the DC airport.

3602
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:25.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

3603
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:27.140
<v 0>Do you have a record in any way?</v>

3604
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.861
No.

3605
01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:29.730
I went online and tried to do it and it's like you can't do,

3606
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.520
you can't get it.

3607
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.161
But yes,

3608
01:35:32.161 --> 01:35:32.994
Tsa pre,

3609
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.600
but it did it like ski.

3610
01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.550
Do you give them your social security number or something?

3611
01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.340
All that stuff.

3612
01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:37.910
And then they,

3613
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:39.680
they did a background check on you,

3614
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.730
I guess.

3615
01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:40.881
Yeah.

3616
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:41.691
I don't really know how it is.

3617
01:35:41.691 --> 01:35:42.770
Amazing Racist Shit.

3618
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:43.460
Probably some,

3619
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.640
someone saw that and like this motherfucker thinks he's funny.

3620
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:48.960
It's probably make it fun.

3621
01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.690
So what do you think it is?

3622
01:35:50.691 --> 01:35:50.851
Why?

3623
01:35:50.851 --> 01:35:52.440
Why do you think I have the hatred there?

3624
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.270
Think you're a smart guy and you see a logical shit,

3625
01:35:56.271 --> 01:35:58.250
but what I think is that you're not,

3626
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:59.400
you're,

3627
01:35:59.401 --> 01:36:04.401
you're not being empathetic and you're creating an employee unnecessary anger.

3628
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:06.320
You're creating unnecessary anger.

3629
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:07.370
You're creating for the,

3630
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.941
for you,

3631
01:36:07.941 --> 01:36:08.421
for them.

3632
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:09.254
For everybody.

3633
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.711
For me,

3634
01:36:09.711 --> 01:36:10.311
it's not so bad.

3635
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:10.701
Generally,

3636
01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:11.121
you were there,

3637
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:11.841
so we kept talking about it,

3638
01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:12.740
but generally I do it.

3639
01:36:12.741 --> 01:36:16.000
I forced myself to fuck with them and then I just go back to being high and,

3640
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.840
and how much time you didn't take your day,

3641
01:36:17.841 --> 01:36:18.231
do you?

3642
01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:19.370
Do you smell all of it?

3643
01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:22.171
Like no,

3644
01:36:22.171 --> 01:36:22.341
no.

3645
01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:22.761
Seriously,

3646
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:23.594
like

3647
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:25.670
online right now.

3648
01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.460
[inaudible] dot com slash always Shaffir poster along with it.

3649
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:29.840
I just think it's,

3650
01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.290
it's,

3651
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.370
it's unnecessary.

3652
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:31.910
It's,

3653
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:32.070
yeah,

3654
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.311
yeah,

3655
01:36:32.311 --> 01:36:32.511
yeah,

3656
01:36:32.511 --> 01:36:32.701
yeah.

3657
01:36:32.701 --> 01:36:33.351
If you're going,

3658
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:34.161
I thought about this too.

3659
01:36:34.161 --> 01:36:36.320
It's like I'm only Raleigh myself up,

3660
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:39.440
and even that stuff about the NDA or whatever else that is,

3661
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:42.440
it's like what do we have the power to stop any of these things?

3662
01:36:42.441 --> 01:36:43.940
But you have to do with the power of the con,

3663
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.320
contact your congressman,

3664
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:47.840
you have the power to write letters to senators.

3665
01:36:47.841 --> 01:36:49.790
You have the power to make petitions online.

3666
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:51.800
You have the power to talk about it in social media.

3667
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:54.590
So they understand that people are very upset about these trends and they

3668
01:36:54.591 --> 01:36:56.390
understand that when voting comes around again,

3669
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:59.120
they're not going to vote for people that represent these trends.

3670
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.790
You know?

3671
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:02.270
That's why so many people were excited about Ron Paul.

3672
01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:02.490
Yeah.

3673
01:37:02.490 --> 01:37:03.500
That's why so many people,

3674
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:08.010
I think Obama sort of represents the same representative.

3675
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.610
Same thing too,

3676
01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:09.630
but if he's going to be the one that,

3677
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.211
fuck no,

3678
01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:13.400
he doesn't represent that he was representing it.

3679
01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:13.750
No.

3680
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:14.690
Was representing it.

3681
01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:15.050
I mean,

3682
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:15.711
I mean he was like,

3683
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:18.350
for the first term he was portraying that thing.

3684
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.780
He was representing someone who would be Justin for the people.

3685
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:21.021
Well,

3686
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:24.410
he said a lot of things that were just not accurate at all.

3687
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:28.550
Like about closing Guantanamo Bay and about changing the way we do business.

3688
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.440
I think once he got in there,

3689
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:32.360
he realized he was dealing with a machine.

3690
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:33.830
It's way more fucking crop.

3691
01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:37.190
What I'm talking about is a guy like Ron Paul who really,

3692
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:39.280
absolutely 100% set.

3693
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.250
And if you know,

3694
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:40.940
if you,

3695
01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:41.700
did he say a ball buster?

3696
01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:42.533
Tsa.

3697
01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:42.801
Well,

3698
01:37:42.801 --> 01:37:45.680
he thinks that you should abolish the fucking Federal Reserve.

3699
01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:46.940
He thinks you should.

3700
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:47.500
Oh yeah.

3701
01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:51.890
He thinks she should get rid of like a lot of major government organizations.

3702
01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:54.830
He thinks they're ineffective and he thinks that they're criminal.

3703
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.081
Well,

3704
01:37:55.081 --> 01:37:55.530
you know,

3705
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:56.340
the fucking

3706
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.900
<v 1>Kennedy wanted to get rid of the CIA,</v>

3707
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.450
but the thing is those things will just keep them if they're corporations,

3708
01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:02.080
which they are each like branch has said,

3709
01:38:02.081 --> 01:38:02.914
so incorporation.

3710
01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:03.730
Yeah.

3711
01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:04.140
Um,

3712
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:04.570
they really,

3713
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:04.820
they,

3714
01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.850
they fight to stay alive.

3715
01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.490
The corporation will fight to stay alive,

3716
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:12.220
which is like the DEA getting organization necessarily,

3717
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.860
which is why the dei keeps posting medical marijuana.

3718
01:38:14.861 --> 01:38:15.031
I went,

3719
01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:16.650
it's been proven over and over again.

3720
01:38:16.651 --> 01:38:18.240
The marijuana is just not dangerous,

3721
01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:20.880
but the reason why they're going in and busting it because it's written down on

3722
01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:24.360
paper somewhere and because if they don't do it,

3723
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:27.630
then how do they justify the fact that they have x amount of agents?

3724
01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:30.030
If all of a sudden 50% of their busts,

3725
01:38:30.031 --> 01:38:30.210
if,

3726
01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:33.600
let's just say 50% of all the Da's buster marijuana bus,

3727
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:34.470
I don't know if that's true,

3728
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.600
but let's say that all of a sudden now there's 50% less work mean it's 50% less

3729
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:40.201
agents,

3730
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:41.610
50% less offices,

3731
01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.020
and it's lots of federal government.

3732
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.220
If you don't need congress,

3733
01:38:44.221 --> 01:38:45.660
let's say you don't even need congress right now,

3734
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:49.950
which is how the whole transition from prohibition to prohibition against

3735
01:38:49.951 --> 01:38:50.491
marijuana,

3736
01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:51.720
so it was so seamless,

3737
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:54.030
it's just keeping swipe a year and a half,

3738
01:38:54.031 --> 01:38:54.721
two years,

3739
01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:55.560
the same people,

3740
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:58.320
they just filtered them from one to the other.

3741
01:38:58.890 --> 01:38:59.723
Yeah.

3742
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.673
Cunts.

3743
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.880
It's people.

3744
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.420
It's,

3745
01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:06.810
and I think the real problem is that we,

3746
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:07.650
it's an,

3747
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.030
there's an ineffective method of communication that we've been operating under

3748
01:39:12.031 --> 01:39:16.560
for the longest time and that method is writing things down on paper and then

3749
01:39:16.561 --> 01:39:19.230
that becomes a frozen doctrine.

3750
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:19.591
Okay.

3751
01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:20.550
That's one issue.

3752
01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.230
And then there's the other issue where other people are allowed to come along

3753
01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:29.080
and altered that doctrine because they were elected officials like presidents

3754
01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:32.100
when they do executive orders and things along those lines.

3755
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.331
And it becomes like,

3756
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:33.721
wait a minute,

3757
01:39:33.721 --> 01:39:34.021
wait a minute,

3758
01:39:34.021 --> 01:39:34.470
wait a minute.

3759
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:35.700
You are just,

3760
01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:39.780
you're making these decisions without consulting the will of the people that are

3761
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:45.150
absolutely fundamentally altering the rights and liberties of the people that

3762
01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.850
elected you into a position of power in the first place.

3763
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.270
You're essentially removing their power once they've given you power.

3764
01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:51.940
Yeah.

3765
01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:53.430
That's the reason we don't trust them.

3766
01:39:53.431 --> 01:39:54.060
We don't trust,

3767
01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:54.661
we don't trust them,

3768
01:39:54.661 --> 01:39:55.530
the people anymore.

3769
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.640
They're going to fuck straight up.

3770
01:39:56.641 --> 01:39:57.530
So we'll take the power away.

3771
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:58.383
And so for them,

3772
01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.820
according to the founding fathers,

3773
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:00.570
that's treasonous.

3774
01:40:00.570 --> 01:40:01.351
That's treasonous.

3775
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:05.370
It's absolutely everything that's against the concept of being American.

3776
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.470
But like anything else,

3777
01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:08.670
once you're,

3778
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.040
once you've established an organization,

3779
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:14.550
if fight to stay alive and government is fighting to stay alive,

3780
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.270
[inaudible] positioning itself more and more complicated and intertwined with

3781
01:40:18.271 --> 01:40:23.271
our lives because the reality is when we have more access to each other the way

3782
01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:25.140
we have now with the Internet,

3783
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:25.711
you know,

3784
01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:27.270
the way we have now with podcasting,

3785
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:31.110
we have an ability to explain things and communicate with people in a way that's

3786
01:40:31.111 --> 01:40:32.550
never existed before.

3787
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.520
So you don't rely on daddy anymore as much.

3788
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:38.820
You don't rely on daddy government to let you know what the news,

3789
01:40:38.821 --> 01:40:41.600
our daddy government doesn't have to tell you what the news is.

3790
01:40:41.601 --> 01:40:42.030
Daddy,

3791
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.863
daddy government.

3792
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.823
You know what I mean?

3793
01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.360
You can go on Twitter and you find out what's going on in Congress.

3794
01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.370
The reason we got Congress,

3795
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:51.660
cause if you're live in Tennessee,

3796
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.020
you can't go to Washington,

3797
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.913
make your voice heard.

3798
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.590
So we'd all get together all as Tennesseans and say,

3799
01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:57.250
Hey Bob,

3800
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:57.701
you go,

3801
01:40:57.701 --> 01:40:58.690
you'll be our congressman.

3802
01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.020
Right.

3803
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:00.130
You know why they did it?

3804
01:41:00.210 --> 01:41:00.610
Why?

3805
01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:01.930
Because people had horses.

3806
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:02.470
Yeah.

3807
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:03.460
But now email,

3808
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.171
now we have email.

3809
01:41:04.171 --> 01:41:05.080
So we don't even need,

3810
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:06.250
we don't need that job.

3811
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.660
The reason we have that job,

3812
01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.190
US congressmen,

3813
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:09.580
yeah,

3814
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.630
there's no longer necessary.

3815
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:12.800
Well they won't let that job go away.

3816
01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:14.980
Don't think that's necessarily the case.

3817
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.530
I think some of them evolved since the leaves in,

3818
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:18.070
you know,

3819
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:19.540
the constitution and you know,

3820
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:21.100
they can be effective as a politician.

3821
01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:22.840
I don't think it's necessary to get rid of Congress,

3822
01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:26.500
but I think that like everything else it's like,

3823
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:31.530
it's really hard to find really good people that can think and that are smart

3824
01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:34.930
and motivated and are doing it for the right reasons.

3825
01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:36.850
Like why do most people want to be senators?

3826
01:41:36.851 --> 01:41:38.260
Why don't most people want to be congressman?

3827
01:41:38.261 --> 01:41:38.820
Why wants to be,

3828
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:39.640
want to be mayors?

3829
01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.690
Are they really looking out for themselves or they looking out for the people?

3830
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:44.920
Are they really these amazing,

3831
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:48.130
amazing humanitarians that are just trying to elevate their community?

3832
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.720
I say very few are,

3833
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.620
I say a lot of them are just people like the Tsa because it's doing a job.

3834
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.161
Yeah.

3835
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:56.320
Cause when we were kids we looked at all the politicians like these,

3836
01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.030
these like Uber Noble people.

3837
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:59.390
Cause there are a few offer.

3838
01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:00.610
A few are.

3839
01:42:00.611 --> 01:42:02.140
It's almost like ideally it is,

3840
01:42:02.141 --> 01:42:04.510
but really it's just some guy we would like though,

3841
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:07.480
like in a movie the president has always like Super Noble,

3842
01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:08.170
you know?

3843
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:08.670
And it was,

3844
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.300
we would love to go down with the ship.

3845
01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:10.811
Yeah,

3846
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:11.680
we would love that.

3847
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:15.790
But we all know it's really hard to find super noble people,

3848
01:42:15.791 --> 01:42:16.510
period.

3849
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.911
You know,

3850
01:42:16.911 --> 01:42:17.744
why do we keep,

3851
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.903
I mean,

3852
01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.040
I tried to be the nicest.

3853
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.400
It's sort of become disillusioned.

3854
01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:23.080
I'm not a super noble person.

3855
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:23.440
I mean,

3856
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.550
I guess I might be if you compare me to a lot of Douche bags,

3857
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:28.840
but I,

3858
01:42:28.841 --> 01:42:29.351
you know,

3859
01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:34.351
I'm a guy who regularly breaks marijuana laws federally.

3860
01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.200
Don't anymore.

3861
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.033
Just quit,

3862
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:38.290
quit a couple of days.

3863
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:41.801
But you know what I mean?

3864
01:42:41.801 --> 01:42:42.011
I mean,

3865
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:42.281
I,

3866
01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:42.630
uh,

3867
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:42.851
I,

3868
01:42:42.851 --> 01:42:45.820
I occasionally will drive above the speed limit.

3869
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.270
I,

3870
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:48.040
but I don't,

3871
01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:48.941
I mean,

3872
01:42:48.941 --> 01:42:50.950
I called people [inaudible] on an Internet show.

3873
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.100
I don't think I do anything necessarily bad,

3874
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.560
but I wouldn't want,

3875
01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:57.131
I wouldn't,

3876
01:42:57.131 --> 01:43:00.970
but what I'm saying is I wouldn't want me as a fucking president,

3877
01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:01.451
you know,

3878
01:43:01.451 --> 01:43:04.960
it's like to get a person to a position where you think they would be the right

3879
01:43:04.961 --> 01:43:05.231
person.

3880
01:43:05.231 --> 01:43:06.220
You want a Yoda,

3881
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:06.681
you'd hook up,

3882
01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:07.514
you know?

3883
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:08.261
Yeah.

3884
01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:08.711
You know,

3885
01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:09.251
you want to,

3886
01:43:09.251 --> 01:43:10.990
why master?

3887
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.850
And we're not in it for good.

3888
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:14.950
We're not dealing with wise masters.

3889
01:43:14.951 --> 01:43:17.890
We're not dealing with people that have spent their time doing yoga.

3890
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:22.891
And Meditating and contemplating the the best possible potential future of our

3891
01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:26.170
culture where we're dealing with idiots.

3892
01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:26.361
I mean,

3893
01:43:26.361 --> 01:43:28.750
he left Mitt Romney almost got into fucking office,

3894
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:29.980
a guy in a cult,

3895
01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:35.250
an active guy in a cult who made a career at a fucking over corporations and

3896
01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:41.191
fucking over people and essentially hijacking a system and making millions and

3897
01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:42.220
millions of dollars.

3898
01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.480
He's a total twat bag.

3899
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.220
He was 43% president.

3900
01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:46.330
He was almost there.

3901
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:48.460
I think it was more than 403 7%.

3902
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:49.343
It was pretty close.

3903
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:50.231
Close enough.

3904
01:43:50.231 --> 01:43:51.064
So it's shocking.

3905
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:51.800
Fuck.

3906
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.610
I mean when I drove for unknown,

3907
01:43:53.611 --> 01:43:54.444
the Mormon,

3908
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:55.783
I drove from

3909
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:00.640
La to San Francisco during the whole election thing was like right,

3910
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.670
right when it was going down.

3911
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:02.721
Oh my God.

3912
01:44:02.721 --> 01:44:04.040
It was a wreck in a railroad track.

3913
01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:04.980
Everywhere you look,

3914
01:44:04.981 --> 01:44:07.820
there were these fucking Romney posters.

3915
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:09.140
When you get to farm land,

3916
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:10.580
all those dumb fucks.

3917
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:12.830
This is funny thing about those,

3918
01:44:12.831 --> 01:44:13.970
those farmer folks,

3919
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:16.280
like not saying that all farmers are dumb fucks,

3920
01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:18.970
but a lot of them are dumb fucks and a lot of them,

3921
01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:20.120
like they just all,

3922
01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:23.030
they'd go straight conservative right away.

3923
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:27.620
Conservative like automatic knee jerk conservativism like the perfect kind of

3924
01:44:27.621 --> 01:44:32.600
like dumbo secure conservativism whether just dumb just dummies,

3925
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:35.240
just they're not doing it because they sought things through.

3926
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:35.571
They're doing,

3927
01:44:35.571 --> 01:44:35.830
it goes,

3928
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:36.100
oh,

3929
01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.230
these barker and the hippies and that was everywhere you go,

3930
01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:41.080
there's just giant Mitt Romney poster.

3931
01:44:41.081 --> 01:44:41.750
So I'm like,

3932
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.931
well,

3933
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:46.931
you're saying is you're looking at a guy who's in an organization that was

3934
01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:52.751
created by a con man who was 14 years old who created a fake religion that's

3935
01:44:54.471 --> 01:44:57.000
based on 100% bullshit you like,

3936
01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.360
it's just tough because people are born with it to then I was like,

3937
01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:00.470
they can't fight it anymore.

3938
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:00.801
Oh,

3939
01:45:00.801 --> 01:45:01.850
he wasn't just born with it.

3940
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:06.830
He was born with it from a fucking dad who lived in Mexico.

3941
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:09.200
His Dad was born in Mexico,

3942
01:45:09.490 --> 01:45:10.510
one in Mexico.

3943
01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.050
Do you know about all that?

3944
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:12.830
I didn't know they went,

3945
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:13.550
oh dude,

3946
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:14.240
he's such a,

3947
01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.680
he's not just a regular Mormon.

3948
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:17.020
You don't understand who Mitt Romney is.

3949
01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:22.180
Mitt Romney was a part of a Mormon sec that left America because they wanted a

3950
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:24.350
fuck multiple wives.

3951
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:28.420
So they moved to Mexico and the 1800 [inaudible] away with it.

3952
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:29.250
Yeah.

3953
01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:33.690
So the Romney family still has a massive fucking ranch in,

3954
01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:34.940
in Mexico.

3955
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:35.960
Yeah.

3956
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.510
And there's not just one Mormon family down there.

3957
01:45:38.511 --> 01:45:39.201
There's a bunch.

3958
01:45:39.201 --> 01:45:39.841
Was that the ranch?

3959
01:45:39.841 --> 01:45:40.470
It was called the,

3960
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:41.303
and Bob.

3961
01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:42.740
Who had that?

3962
01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:43.580
Who at that ranch?

3963
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:44.611
It was called the,

3964
01:45:44.611 --> 01:45:45.500
did you say n bomb?

3965
01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.670
You just sit embalm.

3966
01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:47.031
I don't know.

3967
01:45:47.031 --> 01:45:51.110
I figured there'd been enough gas as he's backing.

3968
01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.460
So passive aggressive.

3969
01:45:52.570 --> 01:45:53.403
Um,

3970
01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.110
I don't think,

3971
01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:55.010
I don't know if it's them.

3972
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.173
I don't think it is,

3973
01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.230
but there's more than one gigantic Mormon family down there.

3974
01:46:00.231 --> 01:46:02.960
And in fact they've had like shootouts with the cartels.

3975
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:03.560
Really?

3976
01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.161
Yeah.

3977
01:46:04.161 --> 01:46:04.820
Because you know,

3978
01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:07.910
they don't want the cartels around the cartels have kidnapped them and killed

3979
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:09.110
some of them and you know,

3980
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:09.291
they,

3981
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:11.120
their arm to the fucking teeth down there.

3982
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:12.130
It's crazy.

3983
01:46:12.130 --> 01:46:16.730
Like when they moved there in the 18 hundreds there was really virtually very

3984
01:46:16.731 --> 01:46:18.740
little difference between America and Mexico.

3985
01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:20.060
I mean there was differences,

3986
01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:20.910
but right across the,

3987
01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:21.111
yeah,

3988
01:46:21.111 --> 01:46:23.000
because it wasn't enough to warrant,

3989
01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:23.600
you know,

3990
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.670
staying in America and having one wife,

3991
01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:26.031
they're like,

3992
01:46:26.031 --> 01:46:26.864
what?

3993
01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.410
How does it go there?

3994
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:29.510
Fucking crazy.

3995
01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.400
And you get all the same TV shows they do,

3996
01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:32.240
which is none.

3997
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.560
But if you had like nine wives,

3998
01:46:33.561 --> 01:46:35.110
you got to cut your eight wives loose.

3999
01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:35.410
You're like,

4000
01:46:35.410 --> 01:46:35.930
oh,

4001
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:37.030
I got to pick up money bitches.

4002
01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:37.611
And you know,

4003
01:46:37.611 --> 01:46:38.271
if you pick one,

4004
01:46:38.271 --> 01:46:38.481
you're like,

4005
01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:38.940
God damn,

4006
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.773
I picked the wrong one.

4007
01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.453
You know,

4008
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:42.950
you'd always ever Gretz a year.

4009
01:46:42.951 --> 01:46:43.521
And she's like,

4010
01:46:43.521 --> 01:46:44.420
I don't want to blow you anymore.

4011
01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.050
What?

4012
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.940
Ah,

4013
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:50.130
but Margaret and you start sending pigeon letters to those eight women

4014
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.990
<v 0>that you cut loose cause back then,</v>

4015
01:46:51.991 --> 01:46:52.141
you know,

4016
01:46:52.141 --> 01:46:53.610
you can't even fucking calm and say,

4017
01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.720
oh you don't.

4018
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:55.171
Oh yeah.

4019
01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:56.670
Let me make phone calls real quick.

4020
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.313
Let me see if

4021
01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:00.663
I can even make it out.

4022
01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.190
It's still alive.

4023
01:47:02.490 --> 01:47:02.761
Yeah,

4024
01:47:02.761 --> 01:47:05.280
you could get those a lot to Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee.

4025
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:06.330
You could send Morse code,

4026
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:07.501
they add,

4027
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:08.160
um,

4028
01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.310
teletype or

4029
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.670
telegraph.

4030
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:12.241
They had,

4031
01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:13.074
um,

4032
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.640
Morse code was,

4033
01:47:14.670 --> 01:47:16.020
that's like military though.

4034
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:18.150
But when they would send messages,

4035
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:21.600
remember like those old west movies are like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee will get the

4036
01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:22.520
wires coming in today.

4037
01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:22.980
Do,

4038
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:27.980
did he do like someone could send a message to say it's a larger goal.

4039
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.050
You just need to think it through instead of just reacting.

4040
01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:34.020
Just like there was something distasteful to her when I saw that they was just

4041
01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:34.890
just tasteful.

4042
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:35.670
Well,

4043
01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:37.320
it certainly can be.

4044
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:40.290
And if you run into someone who really is being a cunt,

4045
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:41.940
that's just a human issue.

4046
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.200
If you run into some guy,

4047
01:47:43.201 --> 01:47:43.411
I mean,

4048
01:47:43.411 --> 01:47:44.100
I've seen,

4049
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.780
there was one time I saw this dude,

4050
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:46.171
oh,

4051
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:46.920
I know what they were.

4052
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.753
They were um,

4053
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:51.130
telling this lady that she had to get out of her wheelchair and uh,

4054
01:47:51.150 --> 01:47:54.030
she had to go through a scanner and this lady was really busted,

4055
01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:54.570
showed up.

4056
01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:57.330
She was really old and busted up and uh,

4057
01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.193
it was sad.

4058
01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:58.591
I'm just like,

4059
01:47:58.591 --> 01:47:59.220
come on man,

4060
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.150
this is ridiculous.

4061
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:01.860
You should be able to wheel that wheelchair in,

4062
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.790
scan it,

4063
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:06.750
make sure there's nothing in and that lady should be able to stay in her fucking

4064
01:48:06.751 --> 01:48:07.560
wheelchair.

4065
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.730
90 fucking years old.

4066
01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:09.481
I know what it was now,

4067
01:48:09.481 --> 01:48:12.570
but the liquids that they can have up at slower process and so they can have

4068
01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:14.940
people elected to could go through there so they can take that perfume,

4069
01:48:14.941 --> 01:48:15.930
whatever or snow globe,

4070
01:48:15.931 --> 01:48:16.764
whatever they bought,

4071
01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:19.500
they can go there but it would be slower and to take more work for them.

4072
01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.940
It's to that line.

4073
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:21.833
But they said no.

4074
01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:23.100
Well yeah,

4075
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:24.540
that sounds like a pain that Dick.

4076
01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:25.100
I'm like,

4077
01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:25.190
no,

4078
01:48:25.190 --> 01:48:28.110
I want to wait for my flight to bleed delayed because you've got some Chanel

4079
01:48:28.111 --> 01:48:30.450
number five that Brad Pitt's pushing.

4080
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:31.890
Well they won't delay a flight for you.

4081
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:32.783
I know that.

4082
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:33.721
That's,

4083
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:34.171
that sounds.

4084
01:48:34.171 --> 01:48:35.010
That sounds annoying.

4085
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.401
Yeah,

4086
01:48:35.401 --> 01:48:36.990
that sounds like it would slow the process down.

4087
01:48:37.150 --> 01:48:37.351
Yeah.

4088
01:48:37.351 --> 01:48:39.000
You have to be like one line of the site and all that.

4089
01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:39.843
You go there,

4090
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:41.520
they go there voluntarily.

4091
01:48:41.670 --> 01:48:42.720
I think the real problem,

4092
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:46.890
why is or is going to be guys who want to blow up plants and I don't want them

4093
01:48:46.891 --> 01:48:48.660
to be able to go on with fucking,

4094
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.823
you know,

4095
01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:54.960
a big flask of explosives strapped to their back that no one saw when they were

4096
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:56.610
coming to the radar detector waited.

4097
01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:57.503
Um,

4098
01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.620
I wouldn't have been planes became as the most important thing.

4099
01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.690
Well they thought about blowing up planes.

4100
01:49:03.691 --> 01:49:07.800
United States was using that and operation Northwoods is a part of a false flag

4101
01:49:07.801 --> 01:49:08.101
event.

4102
01:49:08.101 --> 01:49:11.370
They were going to blow up planes and they were going to blame it on the Cubans.

4103
01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.390
It's one of the things that people are scared of the most.

4104
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.740
They're scared of plane flight,

4105
01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.060
they're scared of crashing.

4106
01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:22.980
So one of the best ways to instill terror in people is to add the fear of death,

4107
01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:27.140
which everybody already has and then add it to a fear of flying.

4108
01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.260
That's why they don't scratch it like a,

4109
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.530
like a super bowl or anything like that.

4110
01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.680
Why hasn't that happened?

4111
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.730
Think about that.

4112
01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:33.480
Think about,

4113
01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:33.751
I mean,

4114
01:49:33.751 --> 01:49:35.860
if you really had like a,

4115
01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:39.210
a nuke bomb or something like that and you really had something that you really

4116
01:49:39.211 --> 01:49:42.360
want to scare the fuck out of people and you know there's going to be 80,000

4117
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:45.720
people in this town and there were all gonna come down to watch this one game,

4118
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:46.950
why wouldn't you drop it on?

4119
01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.150
I think I started with radar

4120
01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:49.760
<v 1>detective metal detectors for um,</v>

4121
01:49:49.890 --> 01:49:50.723
malls.

4122
01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:52.050
They probably should.

4123
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:52.800
Yeah.

4124
01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.500
So every time somebody walks in and you should have maybe,

4125
01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.260
yeah,

4126
01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:56.580
I mean it was it a movie theaters,

4127
01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:57.540
theaters here.

4128
01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.040
They should do that in the bad neighborhoods.

4129
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:00.090
You know,

4130
01:50:00.090 --> 01:50:03.510
and I'm not saying that people who have been approved for concealed carry

4131
01:50:03.511 --> 01:50:04.650
permits and you know,

4132
01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.390
security specialist and the like,

4133
01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.530
it shouldn't be allowed to carry.

4134
01:50:07.531 --> 01:50:08.820
I think they should be allowed to carry,

4135
01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.530
I don't have a problem with people having guns.

4136
01:50:10.890 --> 01:50:13.690
I have a problem with crazy Pete with people unlicensed people that aren't going

4137
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:14.870
to have a problem show your license.

4138
01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.780
I think we have a real issue with people not reporting and dealing with people

4139
01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:20.640
who have serious mental issues.

4140
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.870
To almost every one of these people that have done something really fucked up.

4141
01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:26.460
A lot of people saw it coming.

4142
01:50:26.490 --> 01:50:29.730
Almost everyone in the street that looked like newly homeless,

4143
01:50:29.731 --> 01:50:30.420
some old man.

4144
01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:30.990
It looked like,

4145
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.111
oh,

4146
01:50:31.111 --> 01:50:32.400
you just stop taking your meds.

4147
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.720
Like he sought a suit on,

4148
01:50:33.721 --> 01:50:34.590
but it was like dingy,

4149
01:50:34.591 --> 01:50:35.430
but not to digits.

4150
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:36.720
That's scary.

4151
01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.110
And just like,

4152
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:37.943
ah,

4153
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:39.630
just like trudging along.

4154
01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:39.901
Well,

4155
01:50:39.901 --> 01:50:44.520
there are folks who they need something to keep them straight and when they're

4156
01:50:44.521 --> 01:50:45.510
off that something,

4157
01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.610
they're reality becomes really distorted,

4158
01:50:47.970 --> 01:50:52.140
especially when they're taking it and then they stopped taking it because

4159
01:50:52.141 --> 01:50:54.160
there's a withdrawal where your brain is,

4160
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:57.870
know what the fuck is going on in reality can get really slippery.

4161
01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:03.150
They said that 90% of school shootings came from people who are either on Ssri

4162
01:51:03.210 --> 01:51:06.960
or we're off them and we're suffering from withdrawal from them.

4163
01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:08.760
Yeah.

4164
01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:08.971
You know,

4165
01:51:08.971 --> 01:51:11.520
we got a PR that's a problem that again,

4166
01:51:11.521 --> 01:51:13.600
90% of all schools,

4167
01:51:13.601 --> 01:51:14.370
shootings,

4168
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:19.370
90% either came from someone who was on antidepressants or was suffering through

4169
01:51:20.071 --> 01:51:21.990
withdrawals from stopping.

4170
01:51:21.991 --> 01:51:23.850
Taking them recently was Columbine kids.

4171
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.193
They were on him.

4172
01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:25.860
You know,

4173
01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:27.080
Phil Hartman's wife was on him.

4174
01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.030
Phil Hartman's wife was on Zoloft and cocaine.

4175
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:32.730
I wonder if I'm on an Ssri or the other one.

4176
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.360
I don't know.

4177
01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.071
She'd probably find out.

4178
01:51:35.071 --> 01:51:36.090
Maybe that's making you wacky.

4179
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:37.943
It could be man.

4180
01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:39.430
Roadying I've been,

4181
01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.680
no it's just the TSA.

4182
01:51:40.681 --> 01:51:41.600
It's the only time I get.

4183
01:51:41.610 --> 01:51:42.360
Wow.

4184
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.040
Well that was like Brian and I had a conversation on that.

4185
01:51:45.150 --> 01:51:46.970
Brian and I had a conversation about it like,

4186
01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:50.610
and you know Brian was like concerned about you and I said he was great with

4187
01:51:50.611 --> 01:51:53.430
people like all weekend and he was like super friendly and easy to get along

4188
01:51:53.431 --> 01:51:53.581
with.

4189
01:51:53.581 --> 01:51:54.930
It's not like you had like,

4190
01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:55.600
like all of a sudden.

4191
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:55.790
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

4192
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:56.860
nothing matters general.

4193
01:51:57.190 --> 01:51:58.830
I've never seen it before cause I was like wait,

4194
01:51:58.831 --> 01:52:00.700
I know it's a conscious decision.

4195
01:52:00.730 --> 01:52:02.290
It wasn't like a reaction to it.

4196
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:03.870
Like let me make a decision here.

4197
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.960
Had to get off that one man.

4198
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.710
Then maybe I should.

4199
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:05.931
Yeah,

4200
01:52:05.931 --> 01:52:06.820
I should get off at one.

4201
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:07.640
Not Good.

4202
01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.780
You see that Korean Ufo footage that looks real.

4203
01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:12.430
That's one of the first check.

4204
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:14.620
Check this out it up here.

4205
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:15.791
This is so real.

4206
01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:16.624
Look,

4207
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:19.861
that's signed.

4208
01:52:19.861 --> 01:52:21.840
Even Korean didn't make enough noise right now.

4209
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:23.460
Imagine we've found that out right here.

4210
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:24.423
Watch

4211
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:30.440
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

4212
01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:32.320
<v 2>you son of a bitch.</v>

4213
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:34.960
I knew it was going to be something not a Ufo.

4214
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:37.250
I thought it would be super fake.

4215
01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:38.650
I did not want to watch that.

4216
01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:40.030
Don't make lift over.

4217
01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:41.163
Don't do that.

4218
01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.400
Don't do that ever again.

4219
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.851
Okay.

4220
01:52:42.851 --> 01:52:43.684
For Real.

4221
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:44.860
Scary was scary,

4222
01:52:44.861 --> 01:52:46.190
but I don't want you doing that ever again.

4223
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.550
<v 1>I don't like that shit.</v>

4224
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:47.951
Stupid.

4225
01:52:47.951 --> 01:52:48.290
Yeah.

4226
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:51.710
Fakey me and making me watch horrific things where I know somebody died.

4227
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.960
I don't want to watch that Brian.

4228
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.510
That's not a Ufo.

4229
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:58.271
Don't do it.

4230
01:52:58.271 --> 01:52:59.390
Definitely knew it was all gone.

4231
01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.201
You don't do that.

4232
01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:02.570
Being around Brian locking up looks man people,

4233
01:53:02.571 --> 01:53:05.570
there's certain people don't want to watch certain amount of things.

4234
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.470
There's certain shit that is unpleasant and that's one of those things.

4235
01:53:09.471 --> 01:53:11.450
It's really unpleasant and he just watched somebody die.

4236
01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:12.860
It's scared the fuck out of me.

4237
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:13.250
Yeah,

4238
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:14.180
I've seen a bunch of those.

4239
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.193
They terrifying.

4240
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:16.041
And you know what,

4241
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:17.810
if you looked at that and you know,

4242
01:53:17.811 --> 01:53:18.110
he said,

4243
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:18.681
aw man,

4244
01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:20.210
just drive and we should stop driving.

4245
01:53:20.670 --> 01:53:22.010
Like you're not going to stop driving.

4246
01:53:22.590 --> 01:53:23.810
You're going to keep driving.

4247
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:24.171
It's just,

4248
01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:27.350
it's an unfortunate aberration that happens once every,

4249
01:53:27.351 --> 01:53:27.800
you know,

4250
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.540
x amount of passages of vehicles is going to be fuck ups and more so now than

4251
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:34.340
ever because people are fucking texting.

4252
01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:37.460
There's a sprint APP apparently that keeps you from texting while you're,

4253
01:53:37.461 --> 01:53:38.570
your car's in motion.

4254
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:39.463
I don't know what it is,

4255
01:53:39.610 --> 01:53:40.460
but I think it's awesome.

4256
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:42.650
It seems like it's a good idea to fucking,

4257
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:45.950
when you get in your car that your car has Bluetooth.

4258
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:47.150
If you get in your car,

4259
01:53:47.151 --> 01:53:48.140
I think on modern cars,

4260
01:53:48.141 --> 01:53:50.930
your car's Bluetooth should recognize that you're in a car and it should kill

4261
01:53:50.931 --> 01:53:51.800
your fucking texting,

4262
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:53.180
but it should be mandatory.

4263
01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.880
Pasture could suck his dick.

4264
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:57.223
Who Cares?

4265
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:58.880
It's not worth it.

4266
01:53:59.120 --> 01:53:59.953
It's not worth it.

4267
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:01.250
I mean,

4268
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:02.360
it's just not worth it.

4269
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:03.470
People are too crazy.

4270
01:54:03.471 --> 01:54:07.010
I saw a guy driving on the fucking four oh five with no hands.

4271
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:08.390
He was texting,

4272
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.960
texting with both hands while he was flying down the four oh five and we were

4273
01:54:14.121 --> 01:54:14.954
watching them.

4274
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:16.550
Almost everyone does it.

4275
01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:17.800
That's what the studies is shown me.

4276
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:21.650
It almost everyone does it and almost everyone who does it looks down on people

4277
01:54:21.651 --> 01:54:22.484
who do it.

4278
01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.310
When to see everybody.

4279
01:54:24.450 --> 01:54:25.370
That's crazy.

4280
01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:25.970
Yeah.

4281
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:28.910
I might look at something at a red light and type something out before the light

4282
01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:29.810
turns green real quick.

4283
01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.970
But I do this every time the light turns green.

4284
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:34.400
I throw it on my passenger seat every time.

4285
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:35.770
Yeah.

4286
01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:37.160
It's not worth it.

4287
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:37.994
It's not.

4288
01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:38.720
There's not.

4289
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.690
I can make phone calls with the little button thing on my phone.

4290
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:42.261
It's great.

4291
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:42.591
You just,

4292
01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:44.210
I press a button on my console.

4293
01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:44.400
I don't,

4294
01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400
I don't have to take my eyes off of anything.

4295
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:47.570
I could press this.

4296
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:51.200
I could press a button on my steering wheel that has a little,

4297
01:54:51.201 --> 01:54:51.740
um,

4298
01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:52.970
a little phone icon.

4299
01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:54.200
I press it and I say,

4300
01:54:54.201 --> 01:54:56.150
call Ari Shaffir I fought through that.

4301
01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.860
No on my steering wheel,

4302
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:59.690
so I don't have to do shit.

4303
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.900
Oh.

4304
01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.920
So as I'm driving,

4305
01:55:00.921 --> 01:55:01.940
I pressed the steering wheel.

4306
01:55:01.941 --> 01:55:03.950
Go Call Ari Shaffir that's boring.

4307
01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.580
It just calls you so I don't take my eyes off it.

4308
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:07.910
I don't have to look on my phone.

4309
01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:08.960
I have to press that button.

4310
01:55:08.961 --> 01:55:11.330
If you have the earphones and you just have to like touch the thing.

4311
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:11.931
Yeah,

4312
01:55:11.931 --> 01:55:12.610
that's cool too.

4313
01:55:12.610 --> 01:55:13.010
Yeah.

4314
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.490
Yeah.

4315
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.921
That's nice.

4316
01:55:13.921 --> 01:55:14.360
It's helpful.

4317
01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.620
You can also text people that way.

4318
01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:16.500
Yeah,

4319
01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:16.760
yeah,

4320
01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.031
yeah.

4321
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:17.570
You can.

4322
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:18.110
Yeah,

4323
01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:20.560
but Noah people,

4324
01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:21.890
no,

4325
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:22.830
don't text routes.

4326
01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:25.010
Text Jason Tebow.

4327
01:55:25.610 --> 01:55:26.540
Text mom.

4328
01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:27.591
Yeah.

4329
01:55:27.591 --> 01:55:29.150
Sometimes they're ridiculously off

4330
01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.130
texts.

4331
01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:33.030
The fit Balt you know,

4332
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.700
my favorite thing is the,

4333
01:55:34.701 --> 01:55:35.180
um,

4334
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:36.590
the Shazaam APP,

4335
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.770
the ability to listen to music and tell you what the song is.

4336
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:40.880
That's incredible.

4337
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.891
I mean that,

4338
01:55:41.891 --> 01:55:43.500
that seems like it's impossible.

4339
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:44.100
I use

4340
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.933
<v 0>it all the time.</v>

4341
01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.150
<v 4>If you heard sex with your friends yet,</v>

4342
01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:47.870
what's that?

4343
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:48.500
Jamie was talking.

4344
01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:49.540
Oh yeah.

4345
01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:53.810
It's a plugin that you put on your Facebook and you go through your friends list

4346
01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:54.740
and you go,

4347
01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.640
I would fuck you.

4348
01:55:55.730 --> 01:55:55.851
Oh,

4349
01:55:55.851 --> 01:55:56.684
I would not fuck you.

4350
01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:59.960
Like you just go through like if you would have sex with somebody and then they

4351
01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.080
put the plug in on their Facebook and they can go through to see all the guys

4352
01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:04.220
that would fucker like.

4353
01:56:04.221 --> 01:56:05.450
So it's a way to like go hey

4354
01:56:06.090 --> 01:56:10.080
<v 0>also like a friends with benefits thing like the idea is that you need to find</v>

4355
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:11.040
somebody that you have in common.

4356
01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.300
Is that yeah.

4357
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:14.380
You're not trying to get a relationship but just trying to hook up.

4358
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.610
Right?

4359
01:56:14.610 --> 01:56:15.540
Like who wants to hook up?

4360
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.861
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4361
01:56:15.861 --> 01:56:17.900
Who wants to hook up and no one else can see it,

4362
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:20.540
<v 0>but the people that agree.</v>

4363
01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:21.453
Yeah.

4364
01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:24.130
What someones trolling you scrambled to find people.

4365
01:56:24.131 --> 01:56:24.510
Troy,

4366
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.320
you almost,

4367
01:56:26.321 --> 01:56:28.810
every time I bring a girl back to wherever I'm going,

4368
01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:30.190
there's this thought like,

4369
01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:31.210
is this a troll?

4370
01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:33.080
Are you about to be like,

4371
01:56:33.081 --> 01:56:35.410
I lose sleep with you.

4372
01:56:36.850 --> 01:56:40.870
Almost every time we have a little insecurity know deep down.

4373
01:56:40.871 --> 01:56:41.700
So yeah.

4374
01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:41.960
Anyway,

4375
01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:42.940
that's the greatest thing.

4376
01:56:42.941 --> 01:56:44.380
Then when it girls are really into it though.

4377
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:45.460
You don't meet someone.

4378
01:56:45.461 --> 01:56:45.970
Yeah,

4379
01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:47.470
you're fucking getting along.

4380
01:56:47.471 --> 01:56:48.304
You're great.

4381
01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:50.230
You're at dinner or having a laugh.

4382
01:56:50.231 --> 01:56:51.130
Ha Ha.

4383
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:52.930
Let me get back to your place and like,

4384
01:56:52.931 --> 01:56:53.740
Holy Shit,

4385
01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:56.410
it's going to happen the first time it ever happens.

4386
01:56:56.411 --> 01:56:57.680
The first time you make it out and you,

4387
01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:58.810
Ooh,

4388
01:56:59.110 --> 01:56:59.990

4391
01:57:00.971 --> 01:57:01.804
she's into it.

4392
01:57:01.930 --> 01:57:02.470
Yeah.

4393
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:03.161
Isn't that wonderful?

4394
01:57:03.161 --> 01:57:04.960
That's one of the greatest things about being alive.

4395
01:57:05.590 --> 01:57:06.970
It's a pretty magical feeling.

4396
01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:08.500
As good as it gets.

4397
01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:09.400
It's the problem,

4398
01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:09.670
you know,

4399
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.151
and people say,

4400
01:57:10.151 --> 01:57:12.820
well why would people like lose their,

4401
01:57:12.821 --> 01:57:13.121

4402

4403
01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:16.631

01:57:16.631 --> 01:57:18.010
fresh got some strange,

4405
01:57:18.011 --> 01:57:20.050
that fucking pull is strong.

4406
01:57:20.090 --> 01:57:21.730
Jupiter's got a hell of a gravity,

4407
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:23.200
but it can't fuck with pussy.

4408
01:57:25.570 --> 01:57:28.990
They'll pull the Jupiter has a shit compared to pussy.

4409
01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:31.960
Pussy will make you derail your whole life.

4410
01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:33.340
Pushing me into president,

4411
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.340
stick his cock and knew a fat girl's mouth.

4412
01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.770
A little girl just hoping she'll keep it.

4413
01:57:38.771 --> 01:57:42.940
She was talking to this with a buddy of mine that he thought about some friend

4414
01:57:42.941 --> 01:57:43.181
of his,

4415
01:57:43.181 --> 01:57:44.290
some chick fan of his and he goes,

4416
01:57:44.291 --> 01:57:44.441
no,

4417
01:57:44.441 --> 01:57:45.161
we definitely should not.

4418
01:57:45.161 --> 01:57:45.431
Fuck.

4419
01:57:45.431 --> 01:57:47.050
That's a good friend of mine for a long time.

4420
01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:48.050
And then he said,

4421
01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:50.230
you're there and you see you have a chance and you're like,

4422
01:57:50.231 --> 01:57:50.351
oh,

4423
01:57:50.351 --> 01:57:52.130
maybe this time I'll go for it.

4424
01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:53.740
He had a trust is sober self.

4425
01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:54.580
Yeah,

4426
01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.110
the non drunk with pussy self.

4427
01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:56.501
We're like no,

4428
01:57:56.501 --> 01:57:59.530
you've already thought about this and you're not in your right mind right now.

4429
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.900
And that drunk dude listening.

4430
01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:04.803
Yeah,

4431
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:05.411
that drunk.

4432
01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:06.760
Fuck that part of you.

4433
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:08.950
That's what happened to see inside your head.

4434
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:11.140
It's tough to do anything once it's there.

4435
01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.540
And this could really happen.

4436
01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:17.980
And it's also like genetically you're wired to not just pursue,

4437
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:19.390
but to achieve,

4438
01:58:19.450 --> 01:58:19.871
you know,

4439
01:58:19.871 --> 01:58:21.880
to achieve copulation it's like,

4440
01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:22.953
it's the goal.

4441
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:24.830
It's the goal that your DNA is crop.

4442
01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:25.451
You don't,

4443
01:58:25.451 --> 01:58:25.621
you,

4444
01:58:25.621 --> 01:58:26.454
your DNA is like,

4445
01:58:26.650 --> 01:58:27.483
that's the girl that's a girl,

4446
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.850
two girls,

4447
01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:28.041
girls,

4448
01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:28.370
girls.

4449
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:29.860
She was right there and react to it.

4450
01:58:29.861 --> 01:58:31.240
She's hugging you and she says it.

4451
01:58:31.241 --> 01:58:32.180
She seems to have tits.

4452
01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:32.830
Uh,

4453
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:33.610
there's an ass.

4454
01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:34.540
Oh my God,

4455
01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:35.260
let's get in there.

4456
01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.510
And then the next thing you know,

4457
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.821
you're like,

4458
01:58:36.821 --> 01:58:38.200
I can't believe I'm doing this.

4459
01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:39.850
Oh my goodness.

4460
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:41.621
It's just,

4461
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:42.340
um,

4462
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:45.810
<v 1>we're so restrictive in our culture and the way we look at it.</v>

4463
01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:46.331
It was when,

4464
01:58:46.331 --> 01:58:46.660
it really,

4465
01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:50.230
it was really fascinating to having that Guy Christopher Ryan on the podcast,

4466
01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.670
the guy wrote sex at dawn.

4467
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:53.270
We talked about um,

4468
01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.550
our ideas of,

4469
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:55.480
of sexuality.

4470
01:58:55.481 --> 01:59:00.481
A lot of them are confusing because like our idea of promiscuous,

4471
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:02.770
like we'd look at like,

4472
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:03.220
um,

4473
01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:06.970
people that are in non monogamous relationships as being promiscuous.

4474
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:07.360
Yeah.

4475
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.700
So like if you think of promiscuity,

4476
01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.301
think of like,

4477
01:59:10.301 --> 01:59:11.140
especially with girls,

4478
01:59:11.141 --> 01:59:15.070
you think of someone who goes out and fucks a lot of guys and it's like shallow

4479
01:59:15.071 --> 01:59:15.671
relationships,

4480
01:59:15.671 --> 01:59:16.330
boom.

4481
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:20.140
That's not the original meaning of permissiveness that their original meanings

4482
01:59:20.141 --> 01:59:23.410
based on Latin or whatever the word for mixed.

4483
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.800
And the idea was that people in small tribes of like 50 people would have sexual

4484
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:33.400
relationships with more than one person before they knew these people very well

4485
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:34.300
their whole life.

4486
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.200
They knew these people.

4487
01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:39.820
So it wasn't that they were just having random sex with strangers because no one

4488
01:59:39.821 --> 01:59:41.560
ever does that in those tribes.

4489
01:59:41.561 --> 01:59:44.650
You don't meet someone in another tribe and because they might kill you and eat

4490
01:59:44.651 --> 01:59:45.230
you.

4491
01:59:45.230 --> 01:59:45.611
You know,

4492
01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:49.690
cause if you ran into another tribe and they weren't your people there,

4493
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:50.800
they could be the enemy.

4494
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:51.251
I mean,

4495
01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:54.340
they're not going to treat you the way you would go to Finland today.

4496
01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:56.770
Hop on a plane land and like,

4497
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:57.161
you know,

4498
01:59:57.161 --> 02:00:00.340
get your shit and go to an airport and nobody knows you.

4499
02:00:00.341 --> 02:00:01.151
You're not from there.

4500
02:00:01.151 --> 02:00:01.511
But they're like,

4501
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:02.250
Hello Matt,

4502
02:00:02.250 --> 02:00:02.711
help you.

4503
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:03.041
And you're like,

4504
02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:03.874
yeah,

4505
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:04.773
I doing.

4506
02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.990
They would just beat the fuck out of you and kill you.

4507
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:10.660
Like when people would run into people that they didn't know,

4508
02:00:10.661 --> 02:00:11.321
they automatically,

4509
02:00:11.321 --> 02:00:12.610
as soon as people were up to no good.

4510
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:15.790
So there wasn't a very little promiscuity in that sense.

4511
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:16.690
An early man.

4512
02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.980
How many school shooters are there been?

4513
02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:19.413
It's been quite a few.

4514
02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:20.231
And by the way,

4515
02:00:20.231 --> 02:00:22.300
they go way back to like the 1930s.

4516
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:22.840
Really?

4517
02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.021
Yeah.

4518
02:00:23.021 --> 02:00:24.310
They'd go back even before that,

4519
02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:24.850
I believe,

4520
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:25.390
uh,

4521
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.650
early.

4522
02:00:25.650 --> 02:00:25.931
Okay.

4523
02:00:25.931 --> 02:00:26.591
Let's find out.

4524
02:00:26.591 --> 02:00:28.420
We should know earliest school shooting.

4525
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:30.460
Wow.

4526
02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:30.581
Yeah.

4527
02:00:30.581 --> 02:00:35.440
The government has been using school shootings for reasons for since the 1930s

4528
02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.190
or the first school shooting was in Canada.

4529
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:40.510
Why?

4530
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:41.350
Wait a minute now.

4531
02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:42.184
Hold on a second.

4532
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:42.910
Oh my God.

4533
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:43.760
Older than America.

4534
02:00:43.761 --> 02:00:46.280
It took place in 1764 what?

4535
02:00:46.281 --> 02:00:50.860
Some dude just shot some like a kid or a teacher or something and someone shot

4536
02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.470
or Pennsylvania teacher in front of the class.

4537
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:58.000
1764 so this was before America was like,

4538
02:00:58.001 --> 02:01:00.190
officially I don't have that as a school shooting.

4539
02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:01.330
Well,

4540
02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:03.160
the first assassination in school,

4541
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:04.091
I mean,

4542
02:01:04.091 --> 02:01:05.140
that's just the first one.

4543
02:01:05.141 --> 02:01:07.180
They're counting when the kids start getting killed.

4544
02:01:07.610 --> 02:01:08.001
Right.

4545
02:01:08.001 --> 02:01:08.310
It's more,

4546
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:10.390
oh yeah.

4547
02:01:10.391 --> 02:01:11.440
Well that was Columbine.

4548
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:12.760
I think that was the first one,

4549
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:13.540
wasn't it?

4550
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:13.991
No,

4551
02:01:13.991 --> 02:01:17.770
because like wasn't the someone that some sniper,

4552
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:20.170
the tower,

4553
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:22.281
Canton,

4554
02:01:22.281 --> 02:01:22.541
Canton,

4555
02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:22.950
Ohio.

4556
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:25.630
Kent state was the National Guard.

4557
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:26.140
Yeah.

4558
02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:27.190
That was the actual,

4559
02:01:27.191 --> 02:01:29.530
the government with sharp shooting protesters.

4560
02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.053
Um,

4561
02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:32.321
yeah,

4562
02:01:32.321 --> 02:01:32.920
there's,

4563
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.300
there's been a lot man,

4564
02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:35.200
like,

4565
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:35.530
okay.

4566
02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:36.101
Columbia,

4567
02:01:36.101 --> 02:01:36.970
South Carolina,

4568
02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:41.610
a boy armed with a gun killed of his schoolmates and severely wounded.

4569
02:01:41.611 --> 02:01:46.410
Several others presumably firing upon them in retaliation for bullying.

4570
02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:51.330
He expressed no regret for his deed or miss was 1890.

4571
02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:52.140
Wow.

4572
02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:52.411
All right,

4573
02:01:52.411 --> 02:01:53.100
well that counts.

4574
02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:54.360
That's exactly what we're talking about.

4575
02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:55.763
1890.

4576
02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:56.610
Um,

4577
02:01:56.610 --> 02:01:57.560
you know Kevin's namaste.

4578
02:01:57.570 --> 02:01:58.403
That's all right.

4579
02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:58.980
No,

4580
02:01:58.980 --> 02:01:59.670
you know what man,

4581
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:01.740
bullying makes you depressed as fuck though.

4582
02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:03.670
<v 2>Is that the way out from under it?</v>

4583
02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:05.380
Plus your experience is so limited as a,

4584
02:02:05.381 --> 02:02:08.110
as a young child that you think this is what my life is going to be like

4585
02:02:08.111 --> 02:02:08.440
forever.

4586
02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.270
<v 1>A terrific.</v>

4587
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:10.440
And the people who are doing it,

4588
02:02:10.441 --> 02:02:12.500
they get caught up in a pattern of doing it and I,

4589
02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.010
you know,

4590
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.440
it's,

4591
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:13.701
they,

4592
02:02:13.701 --> 02:02:15.150
they need to be checked as well.

4593
02:02:16.110 --> 02:02:16.710
Yeah.

4594
02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:17.610
In 1891,

4595
02:02:17.611 --> 02:02:21.510
a seven year old man fired a shotgun at students in a school playground in

4596
02:02:21.511 --> 02:02:21.931
Newburgh,

4597
02:02:21.931 --> 02:02:22.764
New York.

4598
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:24.060
In 1946,

4599
02:02:24.061 --> 02:02:27.700
a 15 year old student was shot in the basement where Brooklyn school by seven

4600
02:02:27.701 --> 02:02:30.750
thugs school shootings are not a new phenomenon.

4601
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:32.730
Yeah.

4602
02:02:32.730 --> 02:02:33.031
They,

4603
02:02:33.031 --> 02:02:33.660
um,

4604
02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.471
they've been so kind of,

4605
02:02:34.471 --> 02:02:36.120
they have 90% of people that aren't Ssri.

4606
02:02:36.121 --> 02:02:37.650
It's one or they can come in and as her eyes,

4607
02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:40.770
um,

4608
02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.170
I dunno.

4609
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:45.140
I Dunno when it,

4610
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:45.601
well let's,

4611
02:02:45.601 --> 02:02:46.470
let's look that up.

4612
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.130
School shootings and Ssri.

4613
02:02:48.131 --> 02:02:52.530
So it's like that out to Canada is 90% maybe that accounts for 90%.

4614
02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:54.270
Maybe as soon as the SSRI I've kicked in

4615
02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.220
<v 2>Canada just released new money and they,</v>

4616
02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:57.631
you know,

4617
02:02:57.631 --> 02:02:58.780
they're melt in the sun.

4618
02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.061
No,

4619
02:02:59.061 --> 02:02:59.350
no,

4620
02:02:59.350 --> 02:03:00.870
but the paper or that the,

4621
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:01.331
what is it?

4622
02:03:01.331 --> 02:03:02.010
The,

4623
02:03:02.010 --> 02:03:05.570
the maple leaf is their national whatever leaf.

4624
02:03:05.610 --> 02:03:05.910
Yeah.

4625
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:07.150
And they've got the wrong leaf.

4626
02:03:07.151 --> 02:03:09.900
They printed the wrong leaf on the marijuana leaf.

4627
02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:13.860
It's like something crazy like nor do nor Regeneron exact time.

4628
02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:14.650
Yeah.

4629
02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:15.241
I just took a picture.

4630
02:03:15.241 --> 02:03:17.150
I don't maple leaf [inaudible] argument.

4631
02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.240
<v 1>The SSRI is that it's not,</v>

4632
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.780
um,

4633
02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:22.990
it's not the cause and that it's just a symptom of the fact these people were

4634
02:03:22.991 --> 02:03:23.920
depressed in the first place.

4635
02:03:23.921 --> 02:03:24.551
Willing to do that.

4636
02:03:24.551 --> 02:03:27.370
There's so many doctors at a will end up prescribing these things and not

4637
02:03:27.371 --> 02:03:30.670
necessarily caused by Ssri that that's a,

4638
02:03:30.671 --> 02:03:31.660
that is an argument.

4639
02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:34.210
The only problem with that argument is that one of the,

4640
02:03:34.211 --> 02:03:37.220
the very effects of antidepressants is the fact that you,

4641
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:38.770
you can just deal with shit easier.

4642
02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:40.720
It makes things easier to deal with.

4643
02:03:40.721 --> 02:03:42.580
It like lessens their impact on you,

4644
02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:45.550
makes them feel less real or make you more likely to be able to bless.

4645
02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:46.720
It makes it feels less real.

4646
02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:51.730
It was fucking blasting people over 66 school shootings involve SSRI drugs.

4647
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:54.310
If it's 66 school shootings,

4648
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:55.383
that's a lot.

4649
02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:57.363
Yeah,

4650
02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.021
it's pretty scary.

4651
02:03:59.021 --> 02:03:59.291
Shit,

4652
02:03:59.291 --> 02:04:00.124
man.

4653
02:04:00.130 --> 02:04:00.341
You know,

4654
02:04:00.341 --> 02:04:02.080
the real thing is,

4655
02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:02.560
um,

4656
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:02.801
what's,

4657
02:04:02.801 --> 02:04:06.040
what's really scary is the amount of people that are medicated in this country

4658
02:04:06.041 --> 02:04:09.460
and the lack of information we have about the longterm effects of some of this

4659
02:04:09.461 --> 02:04:10.294
medication.

4660
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:13.180
There's no one has been on antidepressants for 80 years.

4661
02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:13.811
No one's,

4662
02:04:13.811 --> 02:04:14.980
no one's been on in their whole life.

4663
02:04:14.981 --> 02:04:16.420
No one even knows if he can do that.

4664
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.460
If you've got 80 years,

4665
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:19.990
start seeing symptoms.

4666
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.740
Yeah.

4667
02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:21.573
That's not bad.

4668
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.870
I guess.

4669
02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:25.030
I don't think anybody's really doing it though.

4670
02:04:25.031 --> 02:04:25.511
You know what I'm saying?

4671
02:04:25.511 --> 02:04:25.841
I mean,

4672
02:04:25.841 --> 02:04:26.170
how many,

4673
02:04:26.170 --> 02:04:27.370
how long they been around?

4674
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:29.183
Um,

4675
02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.190
I think eighties.

4676
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:31.353
Yeah.

4677
02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:31.800
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

4678
02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:34.250
I don't know about before that 8.0 earthquake and in,

4679
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.991
in easier,

4680
02:04:34.991 --> 02:04:36.230
right now there's a huge tsunami.

4681
02:04:36.650 --> 02:04:37.060
Oh,

4682
02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:37.271
okay.

4683
02:04:37.271 --> 02:04:38.350
If you're stuck in Indonesia,

4684
02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:38.710
<v 1>uh,</v>

4685
02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:39.670
get my special,

4686
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.180
um,

4687
02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:42.460
passive aggressive are you goes out,

4688
02:04:42.650 --> 02:04:44.640
you're talking goes out title.

4689
02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.230
Use the solar power to download.

4690
02:04:47.231 --> 02:04:49.390
Download it for just 489 right now.

4691
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:50.171
Yeah.

4692
02:04:50.171 --> 02:04:51.120
I'm looking at these,

4693
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:51.370
uh,

4694
02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:52.240
these shootings.

4695
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.800
Yeah.

4696
02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:53.490
The uh,

4697
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:53.740
it's,

4698
02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:57.010
it's pretty scary when you go over all the different ones.

4699
02:04:57.340 --> 02:04:58.120
The real,

4700
02:04:58.120 --> 02:04:58.391
the,

4701
02:04:58.391 --> 02:04:59.500
what's going on.

4702
02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:00.340
No,

4703
02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:00.700
no,

4704
02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.750
no doubt about it.

4705
02:05:02.170 --> 02:05:05.620
Is that there's too many fucking people no doubt about that.

4706
02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:07.220
So you're going to have a nominee of law.

4707
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:07.990
More of them.

4708
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:09.640
We've lost our value.

4709
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:10.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

4710
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:12.410
<v 1>There's so many of us that we,</v>

4711
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:14.940
we've lost our value and we lost our uniqueness.

4712
02:05:14.941 --> 02:05:16.040
We've lost our values,

4713
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:16.920
our value.

4714
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:17.220
Yeah.

4715
02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:17.581
We don't,

4716
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:20.370
we're not worth as much and people get stuck in the,

4717
02:05:20.371 --> 02:05:24.630
to a school system and someone's not paying attention and someone allows that

4718
02:05:24.631 --> 02:05:29.600
person to get victimized and become a horrific monster because they're there,

4719
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:31.350
they get bullied and they get fucked with.

4720
02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:33.600
That is the case a lot of the time.

4721
02:05:33.601 --> 02:05:33.871
Man,

4722
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:35.880
that is the case a lot of the fucking time.

4723
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.550
And that's someone who doesn't feel like they have any value.

4724
02:05:38.551 --> 02:05:40.380
And if you want to unleash that,

4725
02:05:40.710 --> 02:05:41.041
that,

4726
02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:44.490
that feeling of lack of value on other people and they want to do something

4727
02:05:44.491 --> 02:05:46.770
horrible because they feel terrible themselves.

4728
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:47.650
Yeah.

4729
02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:49.620
We have to figure out a way to,

4730
02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:50.340
to,

4731
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.430
even though we are in a community of 300 million people,

4732
02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:54.680
we have to readjust.

4733
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:57.660
Re-Install the ideas of community,

4734
02:05:57.661 --> 02:05:58.740
of being nice to each other.

4735
02:05:58.741 --> 02:06:00.390
I want those people to be captured alive.

4736
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.030
I want to be able to talk to them and say the shooter school shooters.

4737
02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:03.480
Oh,

4738
02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:03.901
and be like,

4739
02:06:03.901 --> 02:06:05.320
what's going through your head beforehand?

4740
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:06.600
Sky was what type of

4741
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:09.490
Rosie really wasn't it?

4742
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:11.501
Which last?

4743
02:06:11.501 --> 02:06:11.890
Um,

4744
02:06:11.890 --> 02:06:12.600
shooter was cat.

4745
02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.420
No new town.

4746
02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:14.050
He's dead.

4747
02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:14.291
Oh,

4748
02:06:14.291 --> 02:06:14.880
the cow.

4749
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.461
I'm Aurora.

4750
02:06:15.461 --> 02:06:16.690
Colorado guy is a lot.

4751
02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:17.330
Columbine?

4752
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:17.550
No,

4753
02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:18.383
no.

4754
02:06:18.670 --> 02:06:18.971
Oh yeah,

4755
02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:19.300
yeah,

4756
02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:19.690
yeah,

4757
02:06:19.690 --> 02:06:19.841
yeah.

4758
02:06:19.841 --> 02:06:20.800
The movie theater guys alive.

4759
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:21.470
Oh yeah.

4760
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:22.303
What's he saying?

4761
02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:23.773
Oh,

4762
02:06:24.110 --> 02:06:26.020
here's this school shooter and candidate gets dead though,

4763
02:06:26.021 --> 02:06:26.261
right?

4764
02:06:26.261 --> 02:06:26.950
Yeah.

4765
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:27.790
Did he kill himself?

4766
02:06:28.210 --> 02:06:29.280
I think he killed himself.

4767
02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.390
Colorado kids tried to kill himself a few times.

4768
02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:34.000
The Colorado kids tried to kill himself while in,

4769
02:06:34.001 --> 02:06:34.970
in the jail,

4770
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.420
but it has the,

4771
02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:36.780
does the new count the kid,

4772
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:37.614
did they kill him?

4773
02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:39.210
I think he might have killed him,

4774
02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:40.780
but I don't know.

4775
02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:44.470
We should we look at that out there was something I remember recently of like of

4776
02:06:44.471 --> 02:06:44.950
like a,

4777
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:47.250
why do all these people kill themselves right off today?

4778
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.730
Uh,

4779
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:48.070
yeah.

4780
02:06:48.070 --> 02:06:51.770
Well they say that once they get engaged by someone who is,

4781
02:06:52.990 --> 02:06:53.310
yeah,

4782
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:54.160
they'll kill themselves.

4783
02:06:54.161 --> 02:06:55.630
I just want to flip damage or something.

4784
02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:56.493
It's weird.

4785
02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:57.671
Yeah.

4786
02:06:57.671 --> 02:06:58.181
I don't know,

4787
02:06:58.181 --> 02:06:59.014
man.

4788
02:06:59.080 --> 02:06:59.920
I don't know.

4789
02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:02.560
I don't know if this guy's alive or not.

4790
02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:03.550
I Dunno if he's dead.

4791
02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.341
I think he's gone.

4792
02:07:05.341 --> 02:07:05.670
I would've,

4793
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:06.481
we would've heard about him,

4794
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:07.140
right?

4795
02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:07.650
I Dunno.

4796
02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:08.670
New towns shooter.

4797
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:11.430
I wrote new towns shooter dead and nothing came up.

4798
02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.400
No.

4799
02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.560
Essentially was a cause of death.

4800
02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:14.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

4801
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:16.830
<v 1>I bet they'll say gunshot wound self-inflicted.</v>

4802
02:07:16.890 --> 02:07:17.360
Yeah.

4803
02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.480
Cause to the temple.

4804
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:21.303
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

4805
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:22.793
What Brian?

4806
02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.653
Nothing.

4807
02:07:23.850 --> 02:07:24.700
<v 1>You're fun in Vegas?</v>

4808
02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:26.193
No.

4809
02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:27.731
You went hard.

4810
02:07:27.731 --> 02:07:28.060
Yeah.

4811
02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:28.331
Okay.

4812
02:07:28.331 --> 02:07:30.130
His name is Adam Lanza.

4813
02:07:30.131 --> 02:07:30.461
Right.

4814
02:07:30.461 --> 02:07:31.294
So let's,

4815
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.640
yeah,

4816
02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.473
you went,

4817
02:07:34.610 --> 02:07:35.443
yeah.

4818
02:07:37.170 --> 02:07:37.360
Yeah.

4819
02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.800
He went away hard this week.

4820
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.790
<v 5>The last train.</v>

4821
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:40.700
Pete on his own pillow.

4822
02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:41.930
Oh yeah,

4823
02:07:41.931 --> 02:07:42.800
Jordy talking about that.

4824
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.870
What kind of touched on it yesterday?

4825
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:51.380
What I don't understand is why you always wet and I still laid on it for a good

4826
02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:51.650
hour.

4827
02:07:51.650 --> 02:07:53.810
Like I've woke up like why is it wet dude?

4828
02:07:53.811 --> 02:07:56.090
I woke up in La Jolla condo once and it was barf on the,

4829
02:07:56.150 --> 02:07:56.451
on the,

4830
02:07:56.451 --> 02:07:56.990
on the,

4831
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:58.910
on the sheets right next to me like under the,

4832
02:07:59.190 --> 02:08:01.720
and I was so sure that someone had done that from the week before.

4833
02:08:01.721 --> 02:08:04.820
I just hadn't seen it when I went to sleep that I called up like who was in the

4834
02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:07.730
condo and they were like Whitney and I was like,

4835
02:08:07.731 --> 02:08:08.740
what need did you barf from vet?

4836
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:08.991
She goes,

4837
02:08:08.991 --> 02:08:09.111
no,

4838
02:08:09.111 --> 02:08:10.060
I didn't even actually stay there.

4839
02:08:10.130 --> 02:08:10.941
I think Katie stayed there.

4840
02:08:10.941 --> 02:08:11.774
I just went home.

4841
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:12.111
I was like,

4842
02:08:12.111 --> 02:08:12.410
Katie,

4843
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:13.131
did you borrow from the bed?

4844
02:08:13.131 --> 02:08:13.341
He goes,

4845
02:08:13.341 --> 02:08:14.174
no,

4846
02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:14.631
what do you mean?

4847
02:08:14.631 --> 02:08:16.430
I really didn't even drink or anything and I was like,

4848
02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:17.661
mother Fucker,

4849
02:08:17.661 --> 02:08:18.560
I barfed in the bed.

4850
02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.433
I didn't know.

4851
02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:20.640
Oh my God damn it.

4852
02:08:20.641 --> 02:08:21.320
That's dangerous.

4853
02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:21.861
I know.

4854
02:08:21.861 --> 02:08:22.930
I know you're done.

4855
02:08:22.931 --> 02:08:24.890
Your sleep absolutely killed.

4856
02:08:24.891 --> 02:08:25.730
This guy killed himself.

4857
02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:26.140
He did.

4858
02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:26.410
Yeah.

4859
02:08:26.410 --> 02:08:27.100
<v 1>The new town.</v>

4860
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.720
As soon as the first responders arrived,

4861
02:08:28.721 --> 02:08:29.531
he blew his brains out.

4862
02:08:29.531 --> 02:08:33.480
And I'd like to hear it like the guy in Colorado didn't though.

4863
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:34.960
Like I was alive still.

4864
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:36.460
He's supposed to be batshit crazy.

4865
02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:38.250
Not even like have any sort of semblance of like,

4866
02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:38.890
well,

4867
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.070
I believe he was medicated and who knows what he's on now.

4868
02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:43.333
Uh,

4869
02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:46.150
whole experience of being an isolated,

4870
02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:49.810
solitary confinement like that for long periods of time.

4871
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:51.183
You know,

4872
02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.520
there's something that does,

4873
02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:57.730
he really breaks in a person's brain when they remove them from human

4874
02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:58.870
interaction.

4875
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:59.171
Yeah.

4876
02:08:59.171 --> 02:09:00.520
It's fucking really dangerous.

4877
02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.061
They say that,

4878
02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:01.661
that uh,

4879
02:09:01.661 --> 02:09:02.620
um,

4880
02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:03.580
South American five minutes,

4881
02:09:03.581 --> 02:09:05.140
one of the worst tortures you can give somebody.

4882
02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:05.950
Yeah.

4883
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:09.010
That Bradley Manning kid is kind of fucked because of that.

4884
02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:10.120
Not to ever recover.

4885
02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.241
Probably not.

4886
02:09:11.241 --> 02:09:11.950
It's probably broken.

4887
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:13.700
They're going to execute him and uh,

4888
02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.200
I bet they would like to just disappear,

4889
02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:18.280
make him disappear.

4890
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.750
But too many people are aware of him.

4891
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:20.500
You know,

4892
02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:25.500
I mean there's all these campaigns and all over online Twitter followers and d

4893
02:09:25.501 --> 02:09:27.850
two Twitter accounts dies now.

4894
02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:28.301
They'll be like,

4895
02:09:28.301 --> 02:09:29.680
no way did he die.

4896
02:09:29.710 --> 02:09:33.490
Well he's going through some sort of a legal process right now.

4897
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:34.900
You know me already.

4898
02:09:35.170 --> 02:09:35.561
Yeah.

4899
02:09:35.561 --> 02:09:36.400
And I think they're,

4900
02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:36.850
they're,

4901
02:09:36.850 --> 02:09:40.960
they're actually responding to the idea that maybe what they did to him was

4902
02:09:40.961 --> 02:09:42.010
cruel and inhuman.

4903
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:43.060
The,

4904
02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:43.893
you know.

4905
02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:44.733
Yeah.

4906
02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:49.210
It's Kinda crazy cause all the guy did was let everybody know that the

4907
02:09:49.211 --> 02:09:53.680
government did some really shady shit and this guy's being treated like he's a

4908
02:09:53.681 --> 02:09:54.520
mass murderer.

4909
02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:58.810
People who have killed people get better treatment than this guy.

4910
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.380
People who have murdered people with their bare hands get better treatment.

4911
02:10:02.381 --> 02:10:04.480
And this guy who thought he was being a patriot.

4912
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.651
And you know,

4913
02:10:05.651 --> 02:10:10.651
the real issue that people have to come to grips with is part of the idea of

4914
02:10:10.901 --> 02:10:14.740
liberty is that you're defending yourself against enemies,

4915
02:10:14.741 --> 02:10:16.360
both foreign and domestic.

4916
02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:17.100
You know,

4917
02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:18.790
it depends what you got to look at.

4918
02:10:19.150 --> 02:10:22.360
Corruption being domestic enemies.

4919
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:23.081
It's,

4920
02:10:23.081 --> 02:10:24.010
I mean it is if,

4921
02:10:24.011 --> 02:10:24.490
if,

4922
02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:29.230
if it's secretive and you can hide the information from the public,

4923
02:10:29.231 --> 02:10:30.850
but if the public saw that information,

4924
02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:32.590
they would be aghast and horrified.

4925
02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:33.080
Well,

4926
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.790
that information is stopping them from evaluating the actual landscape,

4927
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:41.660
the actual landscape that they're playing on the actual rules of the game,

4928
02:10:41.661 --> 02:10:44.840
the actual board in front of them because they don't really see that.

4929
02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.960
And by removing the information that's in involved in war,

4930
02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.050
by removing the bodies,

4931
02:10:52.051 --> 02:10:52.281
the,

4932
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:52.560
the,

4933
02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:53.660
the real video footage,

4934
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:54.411
then you,

4935
02:10:54.411 --> 02:10:54.770
you,

4936
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:59.770
you remove access to more of the truth that would help people decide whether or

4937
02:11:00.081 --> 02:11:01.940
not they support that or not support that.

4938
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:04.640
That in just by itself,

4939
02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:06.110
that lack of information,

4940
02:11:06.111 --> 02:11:08.500
that withholding of information is,

4941
02:11:08.730 --> 02:11:12.740
is there decision decisions that the public doesn't need this security and it's

4942
02:11:12.741 --> 02:11:15.020
contrary to the ideas of freedom.

4943
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.883
The idea of,

4944
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.790
yeah,

4945
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:21.560
the idea that also the idea that if we're informed and then we could debate on

4946
02:11:21.561 --> 02:11:21.711
this,

4947
02:11:21.711 --> 02:11:23.000
we could decide what we all want.

4948
02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:23.451
Instead,

4949
02:11:23.451 --> 02:11:24.470
we're being led.

4950
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.500
And one of the ways that are leading us is by withholding information,

4951
02:11:27.850 --> 02:11:28.683
but they also have,

4952
02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:29.693
they can't,

4953
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.471
they can't lie,

4954
02:11:30.471 --> 02:11:32.140
like covert operations people.

4955
02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:32.440
Right.

4956
02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:32.880
Let's stop.

4957
02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.910
That's why Wiki leaks didn't do any of that.

4958
02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:39.740
Wikileaks responded the way real journalism is sort of this to work.

4959
02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:43.370
They didn't release anybody's name who hadn't already been compromised.

4960
02:11:43.610 --> 02:11:45.710
They didn't put anybody's life in jeopardy.

4961
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:48.010
What they did was they released video footage.

4962
02:11:48.011 --> 02:11:49.520
It showed a fucking,

4963
02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:54.600
a patchy helicopter shooting down whatever the fuck those rounds were just

4964
02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:56.630
ripping people apart.

4965
02:11:56.631 --> 02:11:59.390
That turned out to be reporters that they won't let you.

4966
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.840
Oh,

4967
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:00.673
there's reporters.

4968
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:02.930
The fact that won't let you show,

4969
02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.793
um,

4970
02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:04.993
bodies coming home.

4971
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:06.171
Yeah.

4972
02:12:06.171 --> 02:12:06.890
It felt like,

4973
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:07.011
yeah.

4974
02:12:07.011 --> 02:12:08.270
That was during the Bush administration.

4975
02:12:08.271 --> 02:12:13.190
They stopped that photographing coffins because morale up because life magazine

4976
02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:13.811
could show the,

4977
02:12:13.811 --> 02:12:14.171
the,

4978
02:12:14.171 --> 02:12:15.980
the actual magnitude or those coffins,

4979
02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:19.790
you would freak the fuck out if this is what we should be allowed to freak the

4980
02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:20.350
fuck out.

4981
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:21.140
[inaudible] yeah,

4982
02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.840
but that would make you squeamish about the war.

4983
02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:24.530
So listen,

4984
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:25.430
we've already started this.

4985
02:12:25.431 --> 02:12:28.280
We've got to get things done and best way to get things done is to keep the

4986
02:12:28.281 --> 02:12:29.120
American public.

4987
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:30.680
A lone man.

4988
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:33.200
Things get things done is to have no one die.

4989
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:34.191
Yeah,

4990
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:36.650
but that's not going to happen because nobody wants to just give up their oil.

4991
02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:37.240
So yeah.

4992
02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.470
So then we have to see those things to listen to bother your ears.

4993
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:40.730
When you have monitor a long time,

4994
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.440
they're a little tight and you've got well wearing for a long time we might have

4995
02:12:45.441 --> 02:12:47.550
to switch to something a little more comfortable,

4996
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.060
like I'm a great headphones.

4997
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:50.520
Then I just like,

4998
02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:54.140
it seems like it like after about two hours I start getting like my ears for

4999
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:54.300
like,

5000
02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.220
I have glasses too.

5001
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:56.160
Maybe we should hit it.

5002
02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:56.961
Oh,

5003
02:12:56.961 --> 02:12:57.794
that's probably what it is.

5004
02:12:58.130 --> 02:13:01.620
Maybe we should just put them on and do a podcast until our ears bother us and

5005
02:13:01.621 --> 02:13:03.270
that will be the way we stopped podcasts.

5006
02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:04.153
That's a good idea.

5007
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:07.070
I just feel like this podcast was so negative in the beginning.

5008
02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:08.900
I know it's talk about poop.

5009
02:13:09.110 --> 02:13:09.800
Okay,

5010
02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:11.460
that's not what you're saying.

5011
02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:12.500
Let's talk about my special,

5012
02:13:12.501 --> 02:13:13.370
can we talk about that for a minute?

5013
02:13:13.371 --> 02:13:14.030
Sure.

5014
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.331
Well,

5015
02:13:14.331 --> 02:13:15.470
the fact that we're all,

5016
02:13:15.471 --> 02:13:17.820
and you are to doing these self-release specials.

5017
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:18.340
Yeah.

5018
02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.060
What do you think of all the beautiful,

5019
02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:20.781
I mean,

5020
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:23.510
obviously I'm a big fan of releasing content on the Internet.

5021
02:13:23.850 --> 02:13:24.141
This,

5022
02:13:24.141 --> 02:13:27.530
this whole podcast is changed all of our lives,

5023
02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:28.940
not just my life.

5024
02:13:28.941 --> 02:13:30.090
It's changed Joey's life.

5025
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:30.831
Dunkin's live,

5026
02:13:30.831 --> 02:13:32.120
you're births

5027
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:32.491
<v 0>life,</v>

5028
02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:33.324
Brian's life,

5029
02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:34.313
everybody's life.

5030
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:35.160
It's just,

5031
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.300
it's a new thing.

5032
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.650
And the ability to release things online like that is,

5033
02:13:39.651 --> 02:13:40.484
it's amazing.

5034
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:41.041
Yeah.

5035
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:41.731
I don't think,

5036
02:13:41.731 --> 02:13:42.564
um,

5037
02:13:42.570 --> 02:13:44.350
there's a better way to,

5038
02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:47.040
to get something directly to your fans.

5039
02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:48.870
The only issue is,

5040
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:49.530
um,

5041
02:13:49.530 --> 02:13:53.730
I think that something like comedy central is awesome for getting you new fans.

5042
02:13:54.230 --> 02:13:54.930
Yeah.

5043
02:13:54.930 --> 02:13:55.201
Yeah.

5044
02:13:55.201 --> 02:13:56.760
It looks like you put a special out,

5045
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:59.870
but I think you could probably wind up selling your content to comedy.

5046
02:14:00.290 --> 02:14:03.660
You do it yourself and then sell to your friends in six,

5047
02:14:03.661 --> 02:14:04.141
eight months later,

5048
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:04.501
a year later.

5049
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:05.850
Then you put it out on a network and then say,

5050
02:14:05.851 --> 02:14:06.100
okay,

5051
02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:06.470
anyway,

5052
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:07.740
new wants to check this out.

5053
02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:08.130
Yeah.

5054
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:08.641
By all means.

5055
02:14:08.641 --> 02:14:08.941
Yeah.

5056
02:14:08.941 --> 02:14:09.150
And,

5057
02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:11.880
but the real thing is that you should own it.

5058
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.421
And you're right.

5059
02:14:12.421 --> 02:14:13.254
That's why you own it.

5060
02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:14.670
You can decide what gets done with it.

5061
02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.490
And if you have a central wants to cuddle up to all hell and say we're going to

5062
02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:18.031
air it this way,

5063
02:14:18.031 --> 02:14:18.860
you can be like,

5064
02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:19.850
Nah,

5065
02:14:20.050 --> 02:14:20.560
yeah man,

5066
02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:21.390
I don't take that.

5067
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.900
Yeah.

5068
02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.621
And you know,

5069
02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:25.650
and you could always have it available in its full,

5070
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:30.651
an unadulterated form on your website to get it six years from now they can just

5071
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:34.160
get it instead of having to wait for a network to aerate against.

5072
02:14:34.161 --> 02:14:34.351
Yeah.

5073
02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:34.891
And I love it.

5074
02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:35.940
It's only five bucks.

5075
02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:39.190
Five bucks is perfect to get up a couple different downloads you get to

5076
02:14:39.191 --> 02:14:40.024
streaming.

5077
02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:41.403
It's half the price,

5078
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.400
super easy and third and it's good.

5079
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:45.900
And the thing about,

5080
02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:46.680
um,

5081
02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.970
these things is to,

5082
02:14:48.070 --> 02:14:49.650
I'm starting to treat it like a,

5083
02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.840
like an art project and I get excited.

5084
02:14:52.230 --> 02:14:53.910
You get excited about building a new one.

5085
02:14:53.911 --> 02:14:58.380
I get excited about new subjects and new bits and putting things together and

5086
02:14:58.381 --> 02:15:00.030
I'm excited about taking this,

5087
02:15:00.210 --> 02:15:00.600
you know,

5088
02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.510
our I'm doing right now and tightening it up to like perfect form print Jarvis,

5089
02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:07.320
I'm gonna release this new bitch in July I think.

5090
02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:08.220
Yeah,

5091
02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:09.030
I think so.

5092
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:10.700
I think that's um,

5093
02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:14.040
was like 15 months.

5094
02:15:14.130 --> 02:15:15.040
The great wave on this time.

5095
02:15:15.041 --> 02:15:15.810
It was a 20 years.

5096
02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:18.270
You can do it on your own schedule so you don't have to be like,

5097
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:18.451
oh,

5098
02:15:18.451 --> 02:15:20.130
I get some that would say instead of saying now,

5099
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:21.660
I mean after your first special,

5100
02:15:21.710 --> 02:15:23.970
it's so great on comedy central.

5101
02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:24.833
Yeah.

5102
02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:27.090
You wanted to do one like a year and a half later.

5103
02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:27.451
Yeah.

5104
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:29.970
They didn't want me doing one a year later we wanted to wait.

5105
02:15:29.971 --> 02:15:31.440
They wanted to wait three years and you're like,

5106
02:15:31.441 --> 02:15:32.220
but I'm ready.

5107
02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.000
Yeah.

5108
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.590
And you don't have to wait on anybody else's schedule.

5109
02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.690
Well I think I understand it from their point of view.

5110
02:15:36.710 --> 02:15:36.930
You know,

5111
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:39.270
they only have so many hours in a week and you know,

5112
02:15:39.271 --> 02:15:41.310
why should they put out another one of my specials?

5113
02:15:41.311 --> 02:15:41.461
You know,

5114
02:15:41.461 --> 02:15:42.420
even if it's good,

5115
02:15:42.421 --> 02:15:43.350
why are they doing that?

5116
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:45.240
Maybe if I had one of their shows,

5117
02:15:45.241 --> 02:15:47.040
like if I was on a comedy central show and they were,

5118
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:47.780
it would help,

5119
02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:48.450
you know,

5120
02:15:48.450 --> 02:15:50.280
cross promote but I don't.

5121
02:15:50.281 --> 02:15:52.710
So it doesn't really help them.

5122
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.970
Yeah.

5123
02:15:52.970 --> 02:15:54.420
You have this other dissemination vehicle.

5124
02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:55.111
That'd be cool too.

5125
02:15:55.111 --> 02:15:58.980
I'll do a couple of these on my own and then a year later I'll go to comedy

5126
02:15:58.981 --> 02:15:59.761
central and say,

5127
02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:00.121
Hey,

5128
02:16:00.121 --> 02:16:00.511
you know,

5129
02:16:00.511 --> 02:16:03.520
you guys want to do another and then maybe I could do one there and then I'll do

5130
02:16:03.521 --> 02:16:03.840
it.

5131
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.680
I'll do it both ways.

5132
02:16:04.681 --> 02:16:05.301
Do you just in your own,

5133
02:16:05.301 --> 02:16:05.520
you know,

5134
02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:06.360
I may give it to him later.

5135
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.630
Yeah.

5136
02:16:06.630 --> 02:16:08.490
Or do it on my own and sell it to them.

5137
02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:11.460
Everybody wants content.

5138
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:12.121
It's a,

5139
02:16:12.121 --> 02:16:16.080
it's a beautiful thing to be able to put out shit online like that.

5140
02:16:16.081 --> 02:16:16.830
Look at you,

5141
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:18.570
you wear a nice shirt and everything.

5142
02:16:18.571 --> 02:16:22.020
It's a button down and vice versions of me don't play any of his material,

5143
02:16:22.021 --> 02:16:22.260
man.

5144
02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:23.320
You'll ruin it if it's true.

5145
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:24.240
It was the trailer.

5146
02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:25.693
Um,

5147
02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:27.930
the best thing about it,

5148
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:29.740
and I don't know how much you did stuff on,

5149
02:16:29.741 --> 02:16:30.574
uh,

5150
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:31.960
on TV before,

5151
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:33.910
but nobody tells you what to say.

5152
02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:34.811
Oh yeah.

5153
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:35.440
I love that.

5154
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:35.651
Well,

5155
02:16:35.651 --> 02:16:36.101
you know what,

5156
02:16:36.101 --> 02:16:38.980
that has monkey's in space to really,

5157
02:16:39.010 --> 02:16:39.251
yeah,

5158
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:42.490
because I was under the zoo umbrella and so they told you all,

5159
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.930
I did it all through the UFC.

5160
02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:45.070
We produced it.

5161
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:46.370
So you were allowed to do whatever you want.

5162
02:16:46.371 --> 02:16:46.590
Yeah,

5163
02:16:46.590 --> 02:16:47.291
because it was on,

5164
02:16:47.291 --> 02:16:50.080
spike was on spike TV and you know,

5165
02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:54.100
back when the UFC was dominating spike TV,

5166
02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:54.820
the worst bike.

5167
02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:55.360
Yeah.

5168
02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:56.560
I mean spike was like,

5169
02:16:56.590 --> 02:16:59.020
they were like our good friends and you know,

5170
02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:01.750
it was really easy to do a special with them.

5171
02:17:01.751 --> 02:17:01.910
They,

5172
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:05.770
they had already seen me do stand up a hundred times because when we would do

5173
02:17:05.771 --> 02:17:06.820
these shows,

5174
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:09.400
like spike guys would come to the fights.

5175
02:17:09.430 --> 02:17:10.263
Yeah.

5176
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:11.351
So it was,

5177
02:17:11.351 --> 02:17:11.710
um,

5178
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:13.420
it was super easy.

5179
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:14.201
Yeah.

5180
02:17:14.201 --> 02:17:15.034
That's cool.

5181
02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:15.670
Yeah,

5182
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:16.520
it was talked about it.

5183
02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:17.733
Yeah.

5184
02:17:17.890 --> 02:17:18.461
It was a,

5185
02:17:18.461 --> 02:17:19.600
it was really easy to do that.

5186
02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:21.370
So I the the spike thing.

5187
02:17:21.371 --> 02:17:25.060
We also did it with like Herod after a UFC,

5188
02:17:25.450 --> 02:17:26.283
so that was awesome.

5189
02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:26.681
Oh yeah.

5190
02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:27.514
That's where it followed.

5191
02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:28.070
Yeah.

5192
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.330
Perfect.

5193
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:29.163
Follow.

5194
02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:31.400
It was mass like that showed that lands.

5195
02:17:31.430 --> 02:17:31.560
Yeah.

5196
02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.910
It was like 1.7 million people watched or something.

5197
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:34.690
Wow.

5198
02:17:34.690 --> 02:17:35.523
Yeah.

5199
02:17:35.590 --> 02:17:38.050
Did you see a bump and turn out like after that?

5200
02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:38.540
Oh yeah.

5201
02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:38.711
Yeah.

5202
02:17:38.711 --> 02:17:41.950
It definitely was a bunch of new people found out you were combat because I mean

5203
02:17:41.951 --> 02:17:44.110
a lot of people just didn't even know if I was any good.

5204
02:17:44.111 --> 02:17:44.290
You know,

5205
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:48.040
it's like we've seen a lot of people that are on TV that do stand up and then

5206
02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:48.820
you go see them and you're like,

5207
02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:49.001
oh,

5208
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:50.740
this is like a monkey shitty standard.

5209
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:51.470
Yeah.

5210
02:17:51.470 --> 02:17:53.920
Know that I've been doing standup for that long.

5211
02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:54.221
You know,

5212
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:55.180
a lot of people,

5213
02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:58.330
like I was like,

5214
02:17:58.360 --> 02:17:59.350
I could have been a beginner,

5215
02:17:59.351 --> 02:18:00.310
like they weren't sure,

5216
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:01.131
but I was lucky.

5217
02:18:01.131 --> 02:18:01.930
No clue that it was,

5218
02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:02.763
you know,

5219
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:06.160
I'd been doing it for long enough that it would actually,

5220
02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:08.980
it would make sense to go see and pay money for it.

5221
02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:12.060
Jeff props was a comic,

5222
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:13.990
but maybe,

5223
02:18:13.991 --> 02:18:15.850
but then you go see him if it was like,

5224
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:16.241
we've,

5225
02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:16.781
I don't want to,

5226
02:18:16.781 --> 02:18:17.221
I'm trying to,

5227
02:18:17.221 --> 02:18:17.451
I,

5228
02:18:17.451 --> 02:18:20.320
the reason why I'm awkward with my words here is I'm trying to dance around the,

5229
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:21.610
the closing.

5230
02:18:21.970 --> 02:18:22.750
Yeah.

5231
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:23.583
Trying to be nice,

5232
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.080
but when I think,

5233
02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:26.380
uh,

5234
02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:27.520
as a standup comic,

5235
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:30.040
you need like 10 years.

5236
02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:31.120
Yeah.

5237
02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:32.770
10 years until you're really a comic.

5238
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:36.070
It takes at least that long or close to it as a range.

5239
02:18:36.071 --> 02:18:37.000
I'm sure some people are sick,

5240
02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:37.900
some people or 15,

5241
02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:39.070
but that's the average.

5242
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:42.910
I could see that to be able to put out like an hour special it really 10 years

5243
02:18:42.911 --> 02:18:44.050
is probably pretty smart.

5244
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:46.970
It's probably a good amount of time to get your shit first.

5245
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:48.070
He told me this early on,

5246
02:18:48.071 --> 02:18:48.430
you're like,

5247
02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:50.140
I don't do shit for my first few years.

5248
02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:51.400
All I do is Arnold.

5249
02:18:51.850 --> 02:18:53.430
That's the only thing that Phil lasted.

5250
02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.910
Just a quick save or joke.

5251
02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:55.480
Oh yeah,

5252
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:56.230
yeah.

5253
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:57.130
The rest is all gone.

5254
02:18:57.131 --> 02:18:58.450
So it was like you're just learning ability.

5255
02:18:58.960 --> 02:18:59.321
Yeah.

5256
02:18:59.321 --> 02:19:01.600
You're learning how to get laughs.

5257
02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.553
The Mike.

5258
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:04.840
So you're really important for young guys.

5259
02:19:04.841 --> 02:19:07.540
I always tell people like those clunky jokes that you know,

5260
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:09.790
everybody has an act where,

5261
02:19:09.850 --> 02:19:10.300
um,

5262
02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:10.990
I mean I'm not,

5263
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:11.530
not everybody,

5264
02:19:11.530 --> 02:19:12.430
but a lot of comics,

5265
02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:16.030
they have an act where they have this like a couple killer bits and they have a

5266
02:19:16.031 --> 02:19:18.400
few bits that are just left over from the old days.

5267
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:18.701
I'm like,

5268
02:19:18.701 --> 02:19:19.720
you got to get rid of those.

5269
02:19:21.350 --> 02:19:22.183
Dangerous,

5270
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:25.660
they're dangerous because like when you have like a really shitty joke like

5271
02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:26.231
that,

5272
02:19:26.231 --> 02:19:27.710
that Shitty joke is a,

5273
02:19:27.711 --> 02:19:32.060
it's an echo of your lack of proficiency in the early parts of your career and

5274
02:19:32.061 --> 02:19:33.480
you're sort of repeating that echo,

5275
02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:34.850
why do you still have this?

5276
02:19:34.851 --> 02:19:35.810
You've got to abandon that.

5277
02:19:35.890 --> 02:19:36.160
Yeah.

5278
02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.640
You've got to abandon that and sort of,

5279
02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:38.450
you know,

5280
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:40.730
filling that time with your new perceptions,

5281
02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:42.110
filling that time with unique.

5282
02:19:42.111 --> 02:19:45.140
So if you have some old shit that's still stuck in there because it's like a

5283
02:19:45.141 --> 02:19:46.670
tool that you're used to using.

5284
02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:47.520
That's why I like this,

5285
02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:48.353
this,

5286
02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:48.771
you know,

5287
02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:49.401
a special year,

5288
02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:49.911
year and a half years.

5289
02:19:49.911 --> 02:19:50.450
So almost like,

5290
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:50.601
hey,

5291
02:19:50.601 --> 02:19:51.950
this is what I'm going through.

5292
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:53.203
2012,

5293
02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.513
of course,

5294
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.921
aggressive.

5295
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:55.341
That's what I,

5296
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:57.650
that was what was happening in my life at 2012.

5297
02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:00.320
How much did it force you to actually sit down and write things?

5298
02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:02.030
Cause I know you actually got an office.

5299
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:02.721
Oh yeah.

5300
02:20:02.721 --> 02:20:06.110
Well I used the office a lot or I use it sometimes and I started on the road a

5301
02:20:06.111 --> 02:20:07.580
lot and then I just couldn't use it as much,

5302
02:20:07.770 --> 02:20:10.160
right back for two days or whatever and I wouldn't go over there.

5303
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:11.210
So he stopped using it.

5304
02:20:11.290 --> 02:20:11.440
Yeah.

5305
02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:16.440
But what it made me really do is be real cognizant of like not wasting a comedy

5306
02:20:16.791 --> 02:20:17.624
store set,

5307
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:18.801
not just like,

5308
02:20:18.801 --> 02:20:18.941
oh,

5309
02:20:18.941 --> 02:20:19.774
I'll just run it,

5310
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.661
run some lines,

5311
02:20:20.661 --> 02:20:21.560
have already done before.

5312
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:22.790
It's like work on something.

5313
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:23.270
Right.

5314
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:24.200
What are you doing here?

5315
02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.240
Because you've got to build five minutes this month.

5316
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:27.500
You've got to have five minutes at spot.

5317
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:28.334
So where are you going,

5318
02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:29.770
you know?

5319
02:20:29.770 --> 02:20:30.280
Yeah.

5320
02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:31.113
Um,

5321
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:33.200
so I kept that marker in line.

5322
02:20:33.201 --> 02:20:34.520
So because you can get so complacent,

5323
02:20:34.521 --> 02:20:35.354
so easily.

5324
02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:35.611
Like,

5325
02:20:35.611 --> 02:20:35.681
Hey,

5326
02:20:35.681 --> 02:20:36.141
I'm doing fine,

5327
02:20:36.141 --> 02:20:36.590
I'm doing fine.

5328
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:39.020
And then all of a sudden three years passed and you're still doing the same

5329
02:20:39.021 --> 02:20:39.620
material.

5330
02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:40.453
Yeah,

5331
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:41.780
it was a month in two months,

5332
02:20:41.781 --> 02:20:42.614
then years.

5333
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:44.450
And then you are force yourself to,

5334
02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:45.081
and he,

5335
02:20:45.081 --> 02:20:45.920
George Carlin,

5336
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:47.420
I mean everybody really owes it to him.

5337
02:20:47.421 --> 02:20:49.910
He was the only guy that ever was doing that.

5338
02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:50.990
It was doing it every year.

5339
02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:51.973
That's amazing.

5340
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.571
It's amazing.

5341
02:20:53.571 --> 02:20:54.171
But why not?

5342
02:20:54.171 --> 02:20:55.004
Why not go through it?

5343
02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:57.110
Ever Picasso had his blue period,

5344
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.561
you know,

5345
02:20:57.561 --> 02:21:00.290
it's like you'll see the development of a person as a human through their

5346
02:21:00.291 --> 02:21:01.124
material.

5347
02:21:01.210 --> 02:21:01.421
Well,

5348
02:21:01.421 --> 02:21:06.421
well you got to realize a certain point in time is that you are the only person

5349
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:09.110
who can put out Ari Shaffir material.

5350
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:11.360
So if someone's an Ari Shaffir Fan,

5351
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:15.620
you're the only way that they can get that experience.

5352
02:21:15.621 --> 02:21:17.870
If they enjoy watching you and they,

5353
02:21:17.871 --> 02:21:18.380
they uh,

5354
02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:18.651
oh,

5355
02:21:18.651 --> 02:21:21.620
I saw Ari Shaffir and the way he made me feel,

5356
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:22.160
boy,

5357
02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.510
I became a fan.

5358
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:24.081
You know,

5359
02:21:24.081 --> 02:21:25.820
when you become a fan of somebody,

5360
02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:28.820
it's like you want more fucking content from that person.

5361
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:34.330
And the reality is if you go to see a guy and you go to cm six years later and

5362
02:21:34.461 --> 02:21:36.500
he's doing the same act in the same order,

5363
02:21:36.501 --> 02:21:38.000
you're not going to be a fan anymore.

5364
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:39.170
The same order.

5365
02:21:39.210 --> 02:21:39.530
It's,

5366
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:40.363
we've all seen it.

5367
02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.670
I don't want to say any names again,

5368
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:47.990
but I was watching this a showtime thing or mine invited me,

5369
02:21:47.991 --> 02:21:48.471
showtime,

5370
02:21:48.471 --> 02:21:52.070
one of those networks and it was standup comedy and it was a guy that I knew on

5371
02:21:52.071 --> 02:21:52.521
it and I'm like,

5372
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:54.770
this motherfucker did not just do that bit.

5373
02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.400
He was doing that bit 15 years ago.

5374
02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.960
She'll tell me it's got better specials.

5375
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:02.440
They need to invest in a better type of comedy.

5376
02:22:02.441 --> 02:22:04.160
You have such good fucking show,

5377
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:05.420
such good shows,

5378
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:06.511
but weeds and,

5379
02:22:06.511 --> 02:22:06.651
and,

5380
02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:06.951
and,

5381
02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:08.900
and California k they have cool shows.

5382
02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:10.240
So why their specials dog?

5383
02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:11.810
She's gotta be a different guy in charge of that.

5384
02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:12.860
But then not all dog shit.

5385
02:22:12.861 --> 02:22:14.500
They put Stan hopes on Stan hopes.

5386
02:22:14.501 --> 02:22:14.870
Um,

5387
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:16.220
I put it right here.

5388
02:22:16.221 --> 02:22:18.350
They're putting my a 2005 one on.

5389
02:22:18.351 --> 02:22:18.740
Really?

5390
02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:20.090
I just want to tell you it wasn't dog shit.

5391
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:20.301
No,

5392
02:22:20.301 --> 02:22:20.780
you're right.

5393
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:22.610
But he's sweating just a lot of what they put on.

5394
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:23.833
I'll tell you right now.

5395
02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:24.460
Um,

5396
02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:27.600
a lot of what they put on it didn't need to open Williams on did they put Katt

5397
02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.590
Williams on or is it um,

5398
02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:29.793
cat apocalypse?

5399
02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.750
Was that HBO or showtime?

5400
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:32.550
Was it showtime?

5401
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:33.450
I think it was showtime.

5402
02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:34.350
All those,

5403
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:36.570
the Greeks of combat blacklist is pretty good.

5404
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.433
And the,

5405
02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:37.981
and the like,

5406
02:22:37.981 --> 02:22:39.080
the theme shows that Scott,

5407
02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:39.930
my toy puts out,

5408
02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:41.843
oh,

5409
02:22:42.350 --> 02:22:42.640
oh,

5410
02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:43.530
sorry about that stuff.

5411
02:22:43.531 --> 02:22:45.450
Should never make it to the air.

5412
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:46.410
They should be illegal.

5413
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:48.000
Legal team shows,

5414
02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:48.901
hey,

5415
02:22:48.901 --> 02:22:49.890

5421
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:57.330
Fuck you.

5422

Yeah.

5423
02:22:58.111 --> 02:22:58.830
They,

5424
02:22:58.830 --> 02:23:01.110
they tried to get me to do the all Guinea shows,

5425
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:02.370

5426
02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:03.490
I was like,

5427
02:23:03.490 --> 02:23:04.350
are you crazy?

5428
02:23:04.470 --> 02:23:04.961
First of all,

5429
02:23:04.961 --> 02:23:05.760
I wasn't Guido's yeah.

5430
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.151
First of all,

5431
02:23:06.151 --> 02:23:07.410
my last name is Irish.

5432
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:08.303
Okay.

5433
02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:09.510
Only three quarters,

5434
02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.190
Italian and second off,

5435
02:23:11.191 --> 02:23:12.030
a second of all,

5436
02:23:12.031 --> 02:23:12.490
I'm a time,

5437
02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:17.310
I'm not sharing the stage of these current bags just cause we are an origins.

5438
02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:19.200
They all end up doing the same jokes.

5439
02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:19.650
Yeah.

5440
02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:21.900
Cause it has to be about all the Arabs are all the,

5441
02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:23.210
I'll let him telling me,

5442
02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:26.220
well I'll do the Arab accent out of the way.

5443
02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:29.070
Get it out of there and then triple he goes on to those shows and I was like,

5444
02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.810
I'm just going to talk about fucking chicks and cars.

5445
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.793
Yeah.

5446
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:32.070
We,

5447
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:33.990

5448
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:36.560
Different Aaa.

5449
02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:38.140
I love that guy.

5450
02:23:38.141 --> 02:23:39.030
He's so silly.

5451
02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:39.580
Yeah.

5452
02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:39.800
It's,

5453
02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:40.200
hey,

5454
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:40.800
have you heard about this?

5455
02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:41.633
You stuff?

5456
02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:42.210
What?

5457
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:42.760
What's going on?

5458
02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:43.680
Paying no Pang.

5459
02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:44.341
Oh No.

5460
02:23:44.341 --> 02:23:45.060
What's happening?

5461
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:45.720
Well,

5462
02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:46.710
I am revolt

5463
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:48.660
<v 2>three quarters of the way through that book about the comedy.</v>

5464
02:23:48.661 --> 02:23:49.980
So I strike in [inaudible] 79.

5465
02:23:49.981 --> 02:23:51.180
So tell me about that book.

5466
02:23:51.181 --> 02:23:52.014
What is it called?

5467
02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:52.780
It's amazing.

5468
02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.613
Um,

5469
02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:54.391
not that they've,

5470
02:23:54.391 --> 02:23:55.224
the laughter died.

5471
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:56.010
It was,

5472
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:58.320
I'm dying up here.

5473
02:23:59.460 --> 02:23:59.910
Yeah.

5474
02:23:59.910 --> 02:24:00.660
Is that what it was?

5475
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:01.141
I think so.

5476
02:24:01.141 --> 02:24:01.861
I'm dying up here.

5477
02:24:01.861 --> 02:24:02.071
Yeah.

5478
02:24:02.071 --> 02:24:03.780
I was just about a guy who was embedded with them,

5479
02:24:03.781 --> 02:24:05.070
a journalist who was embedded with them.

5480
02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:05.700
Yeah.

5481
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:08.880
I thought the 40 comics that were around at the time and how they started

5482
02:24:08.881 --> 02:24:09.571
getting pissed at,

5483
02:24:09.571 --> 02:24:10.404
um,

5484
02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:11.820
a lot of them couldn't afford food.

5485
02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:12.751
Yeah.

5486
02:24:12.751 --> 02:24:14.300
That was an interesting story.

5487
02:24:14.301 --> 02:24:14.731
So Tom,

5488
02:24:14.731 --> 02:24:15.301
Jason was,

5489
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:15.660
uh,

5490
02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:15.931
was,

5491
02:24:15.931 --> 02:24:16.320
uh,

5492
02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.180
it was only a laugh factory conflict now I guess,

5493
02:24:18.181 --> 02:24:20.160
but he was making like a few hundred grand a year.

5494
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:22.320
They should be where people came from too.

5495
02:24:22.350 --> 02:24:22.531
Like,

5496
02:24:22.531 --> 02:24:22.711
you know,

5497
02:24:22.711 --> 02:24:23.610
he came from Chicago,

5498
02:24:23.611 --> 02:24:25.080
I think work in clubs there.

5499
02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:26.010
So he got to the store,

5500
02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.830
got in making a few hundred grand a year and then all did a new year's show,

5501
02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:30.960
two sold out shows and the Orr,

5502
02:24:30.961 --> 02:24:32.010
maybe one of the main room.

5503
02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:32.851
And this kid,

5504
02:24:32.851 --> 02:24:34.320
one of them who's on that New Year's show,

5505
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:35.110
uh,

5506
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:36.630
they all went to canter's late at night every night.

5507
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:36.971
And he's like,

5508
02:24:36.971 --> 02:24:37.111
Hey,

5509
02:24:37.111 --> 02:24:38.820
can I borrow $5 for an Omelet?

5510
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:40.313
I don't have any money.

5511
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:40.921
And he was like,

5512
02:24:40.921 --> 02:24:41.220
yeah,

5513
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:41.671
no problem.

5514
02:24:41.671 --> 02:24:42.150
But then he was like,

5515
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.983
fuck,

5516
02:24:43.170 --> 02:24:44.790
how can you not afford an Omelet?

5517
02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:46.590
That doesn't make any sense.

5518
02:24:46.591 --> 02:24:48.420
You just did a sold out new year's show,

5519
02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:50.550
but the comics weren't getting paid anything.

5520
02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:52.140
The waitress has got paid.

5521
02:24:52.141 --> 02:24:52.700
The fucking,

5522
02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.360
the people who cleaned the toilets got paid.

5523
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:56.280
Comics didn't get paid anything.

5524
02:24:56.610 --> 02:24:58.470
And that UCB right now it's coming out.

5525
02:24:58.471 --> 02:24:59.670
It's like if they're not paying,

5526
02:25:00.210 --> 02:25:03.180
they're packed every night and they're charging $5 cover charges and the comics

5527
02:25:03.181 --> 02:25:04.014
don't get,

5528
02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:05.321
don't get anything.

5529
02:25:05.321 --> 02:25:06.154
I don't get anything.

5530
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:07.103
Yeah.

5531
02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:08.160
Why don't they get anything?

5532
02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:10.650
I've heard one stance is like,

5533
02:25:10.651 --> 02:25:10.841
well,

5534
02:25:10.841 --> 02:25:12.890
it's a showcase is really a popular club and you,

5535
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:15.300
if you don't like performing here at same thing as you know.

5536
02:25:15.301 --> 02:25:15.781
Other reasons,

5537
02:25:15.781 --> 02:25:16.231
not a good reason.

5538
02:25:16.231 --> 02:25:16.981
If you don't like performing here,

5539
02:25:16.981 --> 02:25:17.814
then don't perform.

5540
02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:18.810
You know?

5541
02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:20.130
If you don't like the exposure you're getting,

5542
02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:20.680
<v 0>but it's like,</v>

5543
02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:22.140
yes I am getting exposure.

5544
02:25:22.141 --> 02:25:24.430
You're getting UCB has people go into it?

5545
02:25:24.570 --> 02:25:24.760
Yeah,

5546
02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:26.800
but you're selling comedy.

5547
02:25:26.890 --> 02:25:29.080
But it's like I would get that exposure if you charge zero.

5548
02:25:29.290 --> 02:25:31.340
So the fact that you're charging five right?

5549
02:25:31.341 --> 02:25:32.174
Shouldn't.

5550
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.730
And how about,

5551
02:25:32.730 --> 02:25:33.730
don't you like that?

5552
02:25:33.731 --> 02:25:36.730
These awesome comics is Zach Galifianakis will show up at your club.

5553
02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:38.200
Don't you like that?

5554
02:25:38.430 --> 02:25:38.741
Yeah.

5555
02:25:38.741 --> 02:25:39.640
You get something out of that.

5556
02:25:39.641 --> 02:25:40.900
So give them 20 bucks.

5557
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.471
Yeah,

5558
02:25:41.471 --> 02:25:43.660
it's totally unfair way to look at it.

5559
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:47.020
The idea that you're getting exposure so you should work for free.

5560
02:25:47.021 --> 02:25:48.760
That's something that the club was not getting anything.

5561
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:49.151
Yeah.

5562
02:25:49.151 --> 02:25:50.500
Well that was the store's argument.

5563
02:25:50.501 --> 02:25:54.610
The store's argument was always at the store is the star and that you should be

5564
02:25:54.611 --> 02:25:56.110
happy that you're performing at the store.

5565
02:25:56.111 --> 02:25:57.850
Like I had this conversation with them about that.

5566
02:25:57.851 --> 02:25:58.240
Once I go,

5567
02:25:58.240 --> 02:25:58.840
listen,

5568
02:25:58.840 --> 02:25:59.111
I go,

5569
02:25:59.111 --> 02:26:02.560
you guys have a box with a microphone in it and you know what you sell,

5570
02:26:02.561 --> 02:26:03.850
you sell what we think up.

5571
02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:04.871
That's what you sell.

5572
02:26:04.871 --> 02:26:07.150
And if we're not there and we're not performing,

5573
02:26:07.330 --> 02:26:07.870
guess what?

5574
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:11.830
You have no show and no one's going to buy your fucking $20 Heineken's cause

5575
02:26:11.831 --> 02:26:13.300
that's not how it works.

5576
02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:14.860
It's not how it works.

5577
02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:15.360
You're,

5578
02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:15.580
you're,

5579
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:18.070
you're confused and no one's going there and saying,

5580
02:26:18.071 --> 02:26:18.581
oh my God,

5581
02:26:18.581 --> 02:26:19.120
this is amazing.

5582
02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.890
Unless you're giving tours of the place.

5583
02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:21.341
Well,

5584
02:26:21.341 --> 02:26:22.690
if you're giving tours of the place,

5585
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:27.220
that's the only the only know the value is in the history of the place.

5586
02:26:27.221 --> 02:26:27.970
That's it.

5587
02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:29.020
But when you're showing,

5588
02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:31.480
when you have shows you you're not,

5589
02:26:31.481 --> 02:26:34.180
no one's going there because it's this awesome old place.

5590
02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.830
They're going there because it's awesome.

5591
02:26:35.831 --> 02:26:38.830
I'll place that has fucked nominee and the deal is,

5592
02:26:38.831 --> 02:26:40.540
it's like no one's saying the commerce,

5593
02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:44.380
no commerce are saying we want all the money because the club does offer you

5594
02:26:44.381 --> 02:26:44.900
something.

5595
02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:47.420
It offers you that box office you workout,

5596
02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:49.270
but it's a mutually beneficial,

5597
02:26:49.271 --> 02:26:51.500
some level of split and it shouldn't be zero.

5598
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:52.690
It shouldn't be zero.

5599
02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:53.021
No,

5600
02:26:53.021 --> 02:26:53.854
it's ridiculous.

5601
02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:54.401
I mean,

5602
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:59.401
I didn't mind it being zero when I was making a lot of money in TV shows out

5603
02:26:59.431 --> 02:26:59.640
there.

5604
02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:00.760
It's your choice to keep my money,

5605
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:04.390
but it was my choice to help promote the club and keep it going because I

5606
02:27:04.391 --> 02:27:07.180
realized as a comic I need a place like that.

5607
02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:08.590
We all need it and I,

5608
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:09.460
it helps.

5609
02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:11.920
As long as that place was open and it was,

5610
02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.660
we could go onstage.

5611
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:15.160
It was good for all of us.

5612
02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:17.710
So I felt like it's what you have,

5613
02:27:17.770 --> 02:27:20.050
what you should do is do you realize that weren't,

5614
02:27:20.051 --> 02:27:21.220
they weren't making millions of dollars,

5615
02:27:21.221 --> 02:27:21.851
they were struggling.

5616
02:27:21.851 --> 02:27:22.241
So I'm like,

5617
02:27:22.241 --> 02:27:23.130
well I'll help.

5618
02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:24.910
I'll help cause I like this.

5619
02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:25.211
Yeah.

5620
02:27:25.211 --> 02:27:26.410
They were barely staying in business.

5621
02:27:26.411 --> 02:27:26.920
So I'm like,

5622
02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:28.510
I'll help because I can't.

5623
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.890
Yeah.

5624
02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:30.460
So it was the right thing to do.

5625
02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:35.140
But the wrong thing to do is to think that you owe them that and that somehow or

5626
02:27:35.141 --> 02:27:36.680
another you should work for free.

5627
02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:37.151
You don't want that.

5628
02:27:37.151 --> 02:27:39.550
Somehow or another you're getting exposure.

5629
02:27:39.551 --> 02:27:42.370
Like your whole thing is selling common.

5630
02:27:42.371 --> 02:27:43.360
And he said also it was like,

5631
02:27:43.361 --> 02:27:44.470
it was a workout class at the time.

5632
02:27:44.471 --> 02:27:44.860
The store,

5633
02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:45.490
not that UCB,

5634
02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:45.941
but at a time,

5635
02:27:45.941 --> 02:27:46.271
the store,

5636
02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:47.320
they said that's a workout room.

5637
02:27:47.321 --> 02:27:48.670
They don't want it to be about you,

5638
02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:49.630
your pay for comedy.

5639
02:27:49.631 --> 02:27:51.280
So you have to feel like you have to do something.

5640
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:53.710
But then they should put it in Pasadena.

5641
02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:53.951
Well,

5642
02:27:53.951 --> 02:27:55.300
but then they said this,

5643
02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:55.811
they said,

5644
02:27:55.811 --> 02:27:56.320
um,

5645
02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:00.580
Boosler Elaine Boosler was like the one girl comic at the time was um,

5646
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:02.980
I got to watch some of her old stuff because the way they make her see him in

5647
02:28:02.981 --> 02:28:03.401
this book,

5648
02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:04.660
like she was like pretty legit.

5649
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:07.150
She's legit and I don't really know any of her material.

5650
02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:07.841
She was legit.

5651
02:28:07.841 --> 02:28:08.770
It's definitely time.

5652
02:28:08.771 --> 02:28:09.161
But yeah,

5653
02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:10.270
she was definitely legit.

5654
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:10.900
But she said,

5655
02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:11.680
she said,

5656
02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:11.801
well,

5657
02:28:11.801 --> 02:28:12.310
wait a minute,

5658
02:28:12.310 --> 02:28:15.580
I've heard Mitzi say no to somebody because they were too experimental.

5659
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:17.470
So how can we tell me to be too experimental?

5660
02:28:17.471 --> 02:28:18.700
And also it could be a workout club.

5661
02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:18.941
Well,

5662
02:28:18.941 --> 02:28:20.200
worse off than that.

5663
02:28:20.201 --> 02:28:20.650
I mean,

5664
02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:21.483
no,

5665
02:28:21.490 --> 02:28:22.300
it's not a workout

5666
02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:25.400
<v 1>club because it was constantly visited by age.</v>

5667
02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.350
My manager know with Derek [inaudible] you didn't really work out because if you

5668
02:28:29.351 --> 02:28:30.340
ate dick up there,

5669
02:28:30.341 --> 02:28:30.851
that could be,

5670
02:28:30.851 --> 02:28:33.140
they're not kind of that someone saw you and you bought.

5671
02:28:33.370 --> 02:28:35.560
Whereas like if you go to a place like Pasadena,

5672
02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:39.670
like you could try out some shit out there because most likely it's 20 minutes

5673
02:28:39.671 --> 02:28:40.504
outside of La.

5674
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:42.250
It wouldn't get agents or Irvine.

5675
02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:42.760
<v 2>No,</v>

5676
02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.080
it's actually the exact opposite.

5677
02:28:44.081 --> 02:28:46.980
And one of the most invaluable tools I have is Tuesdays and Wednesdays at the

5678
02:28:46.981 --> 02:28:47.814
comedy store.

5679
02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.810
You don't even have time at the talent coordinator there,

5680
02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:50.591
you know,

5681
02:28:50.591 --> 02:28:51.361
it's early in the week,

5682
02:28:51.361 --> 02:28:52.480
so nobody really cares.

5683
02:28:52.481 --> 02:28:54.430
And it's like full impunity to bomb,

5684
02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:55.230
you know,

5685
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.411
with,

5686
02:28:55.411 --> 02:28:56.310
with full employment though,

5687
02:28:56.410 --> 02:28:56.981
you can just go,

5688
02:28:56.981 --> 02:28:58.060
you can just be bad.

5689
02:28:58.270 --> 02:28:58.890
Right.

5690
02:28:58.890 --> 02:28:59.260
Not you're,

5691
02:28:59.260 --> 02:28:59.981
you're trying to be,

5692
02:28:59.981 --> 02:29:01.660
but like there's no stakes for failing.

5693
02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:04.030
So it allows you to try some shit and it's empty.

5694
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:04.930
Yeah.

5695
02:29:04.930 --> 02:29:06.340
There might be 15 people there,

5696
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:07.480
you know,

5697
02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:08.200
so it's like,

5698
02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:09.640
I'm going to work on some things right now.

5699
02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:10.980
<v 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

5700
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:15.750
20 million people in La and they can only get 15 that is some of the most

5701
02:29:15.751 --> 02:29:16.890
incompetent shit.

5702
02:29:16.891 --> 02:29:18.150
And the history of the universe,

5703
02:29:18.390 --> 02:29:20.070
the way they run that fucking place,

5704
02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:22.410
the implant doesn't bring her show every night.

5705
02:29:22.470 --> 02:29:23.131
Well listen,

5706
02:29:23.131 --> 02:29:23.940
it's a lot of them,

5707
02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:24.481
there's a lot of them,

5708
02:29:24.481 --> 02:29:26.520
but even on the bringer shows the Improv,

5709
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:27.540
they'll still get a crowd.

5710
02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:28.180
Yeah.

5711
02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:28.651
Surprise me.

5712
02:29:28.651 --> 02:29:29.431
Sometimes on Tuesdays,

5713
02:29:29.431 --> 02:29:29.810
Wednesdays,

5714
02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:31.200
last few years have been a lot better.

5715
02:29:31.350 --> 02:29:32.430
We could organize.

5716
02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:32.791
I mean,

5717
02:29:32.791 --> 02:29:34.380
I think we do it every time.

5718
02:29:34.381 --> 02:29:36.620
We do shows at the ice house.

5719
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:37.010
You know,

5720
02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:37.250
we,

5721
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:40.980
we pack the Ice House on a Wednesday night at 10:00 PM show and we have 200

5722
02:29:40.981 --> 02:29:42.450
people stuffed into that place.

5723
02:29:42.570 --> 02:29:43.470
We do it all the time.

5724
02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:46.800
If we organized and you know,

5725
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:47.451
had a,

5726
02:29:47.451 --> 02:29:50.040
like a place where everybody,

5727
02:29:50.100 --> 02:29:52.720
everybody went out at a regular basis and,

5728
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:57.940
and split the revenue with the comedians figuring out a weird revenue at GM.

5729
02:29:58.600 --> 02:29:59.090
Yeah,

5730
02:29:59.090 --> 02:29:59.370
yeah,

5731
02:29:59.370 --> 02:29:59.611
yeah.

5732
02:29:59.611 --> 02:30:00.421
Just figuring out,

5733
02:30:00.421 --> 02:30:00.990
okay,

5734
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:01.680
this what is,

5735
02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:03.330
how much does it cost us to keep open,

5736
02:30:03.390 --> 02:30:05.460
which would cost that much as much.

5737
02:30:05.461 --> 02:30:07.110
It costs this much to buy food.

5738
02:30:07.111 --> 02:30:07.651
So let's also,

5739
02:30:07.651 --> 02:30:11.640
let's set this aside and then let's figure out how much profit there is and then

5740
02:30:11.641 --> 02:30:12.391
let's split it all.

5741
02:30:12.391 --> 02:30:14.760
Let's figure out a way to make it legit.

5742
02:30:14.761 --> 02:30:14.991
Where,

5743
02:30:14.991 --> 02:30:15.240
you know,

5744
02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:15.811
the comics,

5745
02:30:15.811 --> 02:30:17.460
it's benefits them to work there,

5746
02:30:17.850 --> 02:30:19.710
but that'd be it after Topia.

5747
02:30:19.950 --> 02:30:20.580
Yeah,

5748
02:30:20.580 --> 02:30:21.570
I think that's possible.

5749
02:30:21.571 --> 02:30:23.460
I think an artist's utopia is possible.

5750
02:30:23.490 --> 02:30:26.340
So much competition to get into a club like that.

5751
02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:27.330
Yeah.

5752
02:30:27.330 --> 02:30:28.560
Well there's already competition now.

5753
02:30:28.561 --> 02:30:29.520
I mean that people,

5754
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:32.970
there was a duty waited in line at the fucking ice house waiting in line.

5755
02:30:32.971 --> 02:30:33.121
You know,

5756
02:30:33.121 --> 02:30:35.130
cause I always take pictures with people afterwards.

5757
02:30:35.131 --> 02:30:35.970
The guy was a comic,

5758
02:30:35.971 --> 02:30:37.260
waited in line to the very end.

5759
02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.750
I told you and he asked me how he gets on the show.

5760
02:30:39.751 --> 02:30:40.021
I'm like,

5761
02:30:40.021 --> 02:30:40.854
you don't,

5762
02:30:41.210 --> 02:30:41.620
you know,

5763
02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:42.630
I've got to be my friend.

5764
02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:42.841
You know,

5765
02:30:42.841 --> 02:30:44.340
I don't know you some dude,

5766
02:30:44.341 --> 02:30:45.510
he's just started to do comedy.

5767
02:30:45.511 --> 02:30:47.070
You can't just like get in here.

5768
02:30:47.410 --> 02:30:49.380
These are sold out shows and there's seven of us,

5769
02:30:49.381 --> 02:30:49.671
you know?

5770
02:30:49.671 --> 02:30:50.280
And there's,

5771
02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:51.600
you're dealing with Greg Fitzsimmons,

5772
02:30:51.601 --> 02:30:52.470
Brian Cowen,

5773
02:30:52.471 --> 02:30:52.861
you,

5774
02:30:52.861 --> 02:30:53.800
Joey Diaz mean they're,

5775
02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:54.870
they're murderers.

5776
02:30:54.930 --> 02:30:56.490
Murder after murderer.

5777
02:30:56.730 --> 02:31:00.750
Like you can't just slide in there with your shitty five minutes on doughnuts

5778
02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:01.584
and cops.

5779
02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:02.470
Yeah.

5780
02:31:02.470 --> 02:31:03.190
Like I said,

5781
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.401
<v 2>yeah,</v>

5782
02:31:03.401 --> 02:31:05.620
but the only they see as themselves like I want it.

5783
02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:06.190
Right.

5784
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.401
You're like,

5785
02:31:06.401 --> 02:31:06.641
I know,

5786
02:31:06.641 --> 02:31:07.474
but

5787
02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.850
<v 1>what do you remember that feeling,</v>

5788
02:31:08.851 --> 02:31:09.150
man?

5789
02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:09.930
Fuck yeah.

5790
02:31:09.930 --> 02:31:11.040
You remember that feeling when you just,

5791
02:31:11.250 --> 02:31:13.770
you were so delusional on stage.

5792
02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:14.221
Good enough.

5793
02:31:14.221 --> 02:31:14.971
Why can't I get on?

5794
02:31:14.971 --> 02:31:16.680
Because it's got nothing to do with that right now.

5795
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:17.220
Yeah.

5796
02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:19.740
And some of them you talked to and you just know they a dick.

5797
02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:20.230
Peter Chan

5798
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.731
<v 0>used to do that.</v>

5799
02:31:20.731 --> 02:31:22.470
He used to complain about not getting on stage and he goes,

5800
02:31:22.690 --> 02:31:24.030
but I've been there for 10 years.

5801
02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:25.280
I was like Bababa shut,

5802
02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:25.450
done,

5803
02:31:25.450 --> 02:31:25.831
get spots.

5804
02:31:25.831 --> 02:31:26.400
Either he goes,

5805
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:27.630
but he only been here eight years.

5806
02:31:27.631 --> 02:31:29.520
I've been there 10 years so me and I'll be like,

5807
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:31.310
oh you're crazy person though.

5808
02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:32.670
You are missing the point.

5809
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:34.410
Peter Chan was the only guy that I bought.

5810
02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:36.150
I actually hosted over

5811
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:40.860
to keep Peter Chen from hosting at one night cause McGuire was,

5812
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:43.500
because my friend Chris Mcguire was going to,

5813
02:31:43.530 --> 02:31:47.760
he was going to audition for myths and writer of the Barn and I knew that if

5814
02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:48.930
this fucking,

5815
02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:50.700
if this guy was hosting it,

5816
02:31:50.730 --> 02:31:54.390
I'm like Mcguire's going to have no chance because there's going to be no show.

5817
02:31:54.391 --> 02:31:55.680
It's going to be just death.

5818
02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:57.090
He's such a terrible,

5819
02:31:57.091 --> 02:31:59.670
terrible comedian that if he was hosting it,

5820
02:31:59.671 --> 02:32:01.530
there's no way he would generate any laughs.

5821
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:03.600
It would set the tone for the entire night.

5822
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:04.680
No one will be having fun.

5823
02:32:04.681 --> 02:32:05.161
It wouldn't be,

5824
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:05.970
it wouldn't be good.

5825
02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:07.530
So at the height of fear factor?

5826
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:08.623
Yeah,

5827
02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:15.420
the open mic at 7:00 PM there all day.

5828
02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:16.590
All the employees.

5829
02:32:16.650 --> 02:32:18.000
It was pretty Rad for us.

5830
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:21.030
It was just an employee for like fucking Joe Rogan is hosting tonight.

5831
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:21.953
What the fuck?

5832
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:23.490
It was fun to do and it works.

5833
02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:24.450
Chris got past,

5834
02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:24.841
you know,

5835
02:32:24.841 --> 02:32:26.190
it's like he never got any,

5836
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:27.570
did really like that spots though.

5837
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:30.270
It was like one of those things where he wanted them to just hang out and call

5838
02:32:30.271 --> 02:32:30.600
in.

5839
02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:32.070
Like you pass him and then either,

5840
02:32:32.071 --> 02:32:33.120
I don't really use them.

5841
02:32:33.121 --> 02:32:33.510
They know.

5842
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:34.620
You know how it is at the store.

5843
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:35.970
The store wants you there.

5844
02:32:35.971 --> 02:32:36.850
You got to hang out.

5845
02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.850
You gotta be a part of the furniture dude.

5846
02:32:38.851 --> 02:32:40.190
I know you used to fucking,

5847
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.890
I used to love that.

5848
02:32:40.890 --> 02:32:43.770
So when you hung out on employee nights on Sunday or Monday,

5849
02:32:43.771 --> 02:32:44.604
I loved it too.

5850
02:32:45.210 --> 02:32:46.290
I just love hanging out there.

5851
02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:46.891
We would do,

5852
02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:49.380
we do a night where everyone tried to each other's material,

5853
02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:50.401
all the employees,

5854
02:32:50.401 --> 02:32:50.970
but were like,

5855
02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:53.490
we'd have to pick out of a hat because of who you get.

5856
02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:54.840
And I remember watching it.

5857
02:32:54.841 --> 02:32:55.950
Just laughing.

5858
02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:57.720
That was fun.

5859
02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:58.501
Those are fun shit.

5860
02:32:58.501 --> 02:32:58.710
Yeah,

5861
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:59.520
I remember a,

5862
02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:00.600
what the fuck is his name?

5863
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:01.490
The dude who was really funny.

5864
02:33:01.491 --> 02:33:02.700
It doesn't do comedy anymore.

5865
02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.510
Um,

5866
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.811
pick her up.

5867
02:33:03.811 --> 02:33:04.644
Our gym painter,

5868
02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:05.430
painter,

5869
02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:05.820
painter.

5870
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:06.320
Yeah.

5871
02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:07.680
What he stopped doing comedy?

5872
02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:08.430
Yeah.

5873
02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:08.700
Yeah.

5874
02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:09.960
He's another one where I was like,

5875
02:33:09.961 --> 02:33:10.261
man,

5876
02:33:10.261 --> 02:33:11.370
this guy is funny man.

5877
02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:13.200
He was gonna make it.

5878
02:33:13.201 --> 02:33:14.034
He's going to make it.

5879
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:14.340
He's,

5880
02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:15.210
he's solid.

5881
02:33:15.430 --> 02:33:15.871
And I'm like,

5882
02:33:15.871 --> 02:33:18.900
I could see this guy just crushing a tell style on the road.

5883
02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:21.460
And then for whatever reason it's,

5884
02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:25.380
it's a very delicate thing that that makes a comic,

5885
02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.660
especially just for a few years,

5886
02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:27.870
you're out his way through.

5887
02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:29.220
You're not getting any validation.

5888
02:33:29.250 --> 02:33:30.720
It's only reason you're doing this for validation.

5889
02:33:30.721 --> 02:33:33.780
I always wonder like what is it about like certain Comedians,

5890
02:33:33.810 --> 02:33:34.643
Robert Ward,

5891
02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:38.640
what is it about certain comedians that just like really crack through and what

5892
02:33:38.641 --> 02:33:40.410
is it about certain comedians like you know,

5893
02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:44.070
I always talk about Reggie Big Fab and then brilliant regimen fraud and was in

5894
02:33:44.071 --> 02:33:45.350
the nineties you know,

5895
02:33:45.390 --> 02:33:49.840
and then I ran into a Kevin Hart the other day in my neighborhood actually is

5896
02:33:49.870 --> 02:33:50.820
the first time I ever met him.

5897
02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:52.530
Super Nice Guy.

5898
02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:54.060
Super Nice,

5899
02:33:54.061 --> 02:33:55.020
super cool.

5900
02:33:55.170 --> 02:33:56.250
Super friendly.

5901
02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:57.660
Like really genuine.

5902
02:33:57.661 --> 02:33:58.950
Like you could tell like right away,

5903
02:33:58.951 --> 02:34:00.390
like really cool car.

5904
02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:00.780
Yeah.

5905
02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:01.220
And he can't,

5906
02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.730
he can't be any bigger than that guy.

5907
02:34:02.770 --> 02:34:03.240
Yeah.

5908
02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:06.420
He's like Dane Cook was when he was at its peak.

5909
02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.620
That's where Kevin Hart is right now.

5910
02:34:07.621 --> 02:34:08.850
Maybe even a little bigger.

5911
02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:09.960
Possibly.

5912
02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:10.480
Yeah.

5913
02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:11.400
Pyrotechnics.

5914
02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:11.701
Yeah.

5915
02:34:11.701 --> 02:34:15.750
He made me even a little bigger because he's doing comedy movies like dude doing

5916
02:34:15.751 --> 02:34:19.240
movies of his standup and he's doing legit movies that are actually funny.

5917
02:34:19.470 --> 02:34:20.560
Or as Dane Cook's movies,

5918
02:34:20.561 --> 02:34:21.670
we're all dog shit.

5919
02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:22.180
Yeah.

5920
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:24.490
He just did dog shit movie after dog shit movie.

5921
02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:25.181
I mean,

5922
02:34:25.181 --> 02:34:27.490
I think he did like them or played a serial killer once.

5923
02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:28.510
That was probably a pretty good,

5924
02:34:28.930 --> 02:34:29.770
I heard it was pretty good.

5925
02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:30.710
I heard that too,

5926
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:31.480
but I don't know.

5927
02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:32.051
I didn't say it,

5928
02:34:32.051 --> 02:34:33.730
but I saw a couple of them that were like,

5929
02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:34.893
they were like,

5930
02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:36.730
it was almost like the,

5931
02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:39.220
the aliens were trying to replicate it,

5932
02:34:39.221 --> 02:34:42.340
human beings for the invasion of the body snatchers,

5933
02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:43.151
which by the way,

5934
02:34:43.151 --> 02:34:44.560
I watched the other day,

5935
02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:46.690
I watched two versions.

5936
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:49.060
I watched one of them for the 1950s,

5937
02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:50.740
which was really weird.

5938
02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:51.731
And then,

5939
02:34:51.731 --> 02:34:51.871
uh,

5940
02:34:51.871 --> 02:34:55.150
I watched the other one from 1978 with Donald Sutherland,

5941
02:34:55.390 --> 02:34:57.240
which was fucking awesome early.

5942
02:34:57.370 --> 02:34:58.570
It was really good.

5943
02:34:58.571 --> 02:34:59.650
It totally holds up.

5944
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.011
Yeah.

5945
02:35:00.011 --> 02:35:00.350
Did you,

5946
02:35:00.350 --> 02:35:01.001
you remember it?

5947
02:35:01.001 --> 02:35:01.834
Yeah.

5948
02:35:01.930 --> 02:35:02.763
Yeah.

5949
02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:04.630
It really holds up really.

5950
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:05.410
That's cool.

5951
02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:05.621
Yeah.

5952
02:35:05.621 --> 02:35:09.100
It's some of the 70s horror movies cause it's so grainy that it lends itself

5953
02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:10.083
since it's old.

5954
02:35:10.090 --> 02:35:10.720
Yeah.

5955
02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:13.390
Passivity more legit as opposed to as special effects movie with mince.

5956
02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:14.410
It makes it less legit.

5957
02:35:14.430 --> 02:35:16.690
Well I watched it with Mrs [inaudible] and we were like,

5958
02:35:16.691 --> 02:35:16.931
wow,

5959
02:35:16.931 --> 02:35:18.160
this is really interesting.

5960
02:35:18.161 --> 02:35:18.491
It's like,

5961
02:35:18.491 --> 02:35:20.860
it's such a different style of film.

5962
02:35:20.861 --> 02:35:22.900
Like the way they did Jeff Goldbloom is in,

5963
02:35:22.901 --> 02:35:24.040
I forgot Jeff Goldbloom,

5964
02:35:24.041 --> 02:35:24.371
isn't it?

5965
02:35:24.371 --> 02:35:24.671
Yeah,

5966
02:35:24.671 --> 02:35:26.440
he's so young and skinny.

5967
02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:28.730
It's really what he was like a pencil I like.

5968
02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:30.700
And those guys that were stars for,

5969
02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:31.211
you know,

5970
02:35:31.211 --> 02:35:32.044
a billion years.

5971
02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.580
And you see them Monday when they started?

5972
02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:33.980
Yeah.

5973
02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:36.130
Like the girl from sex and the city when she was in La Story.

5974
02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:36.531
Yeah,

5975
02:35:36.531 --> 02:35:36.831
of course.

5976
02:35:36.831 --> 02:35:37.370
Face one.

5977
02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:37.910
Yeah.

5978
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:38.743
How is she famous?

5979
02:35:38.770 --> 02:35:39.140
You see them,

5980
02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:39.690
their first roles.

5981
02:35:39.690 --> 02:35:39.910
You're like,

5982
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:40.031
oh,

5983
02:35:40.031 --> 02:35:44.340
I get it when you were a young fucking rambunctious 26 year olds and you look

5984
02:35:44.350 --> 02:35:45.220
fucking great.

5985
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:45.960
Yeah.

5986
02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:46.221
You know,

5987
02:35:46.221 --> 02:35:46.451
he's like,

5988
02:35:46.451 --> 02:35:47.320
I totally get it now.

5989
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.460
You're just,

5990
02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:51.190
Kim could trawl the slot and the sex and the city.

5991
02:35:51.570 --> 02:35:52.361
When she was young,

5992
02:35:52.361 --> 02:35:54.220
she was unbelievably hot.

5993
02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:55.420
If it's a pretty hot at 50,

5994
02:35:58.130 --> 02:35:59.650
I fucked her 54 and it was,

5995
02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:00.513
it was kind of,

5996
02:36:01.810 --> 02:36:03.640
do you know anybody who did know?

5997
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:04.211
I know,

5998
02:36:04.211 --> 02:36:05.044
uh,

5999
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:06.910
yeah.

6000
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:07.743
Maybe I should stop.

6001
02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:08.141
What will,

6002
02:36:08.141 --> 02:36:09.820
you can just change the names to protect the innocent,

6003
02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:11.260
but then it wouldn't be as fun.

6004
02:36:11.290 --> 02:36:12.640
Well tell me what you got going on.

6005
02:36:12.641 --> 02:36:13.311
I don't know what he's saying.

6006
02:36:13.311 --> 02:36:13.481
Well,

6007
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:15.400
I know someone who boned like an eighties.

6008
02:36:15.430 --> 02:36:16.510
Humongous star.

6009
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:17.350
Really?

6010
02:36:17.350 --> 02:36:18.183
Yeah.

6011
02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:19.233
Okay.

6012
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.590
Um,

6013
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:20.350
who's The star?

6014
02:36:20.350 --> 02:36:21.183
That's a problem.

6015
02:36:21.350 --> 02:36:22.270
I don't know if I should say,

6016
02:36:22.271 --> 02:36:24.430
even though it comes around once in a while.

6017
02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:24.671
Oh,

6018
02:36:24.671 --> 02:36:24.911
okay.

6019
02:36:24.911 --> 02:36:25.400
Don't say it.

6020
02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:26.030
Yeah,

6021
02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.820
it is.

6022
02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:27.490
Yeah.

6023
02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:28.480
How big a star.

6024
02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:29.763
Pretty big.

6025
02:36:30.130 --> 02:36:30.820
Yeah.

6026
02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:31.750
I'll tell you afterwards.

6027
02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:32.290
Okay.

6028
02:36:32.290 --> 02:36:32.591
Damn.

6029
02:36:32.591 --> 02:36:34.160
This doesn't help the podcast though.

6030
02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:36.220
And you can all pressure him into telling you who is it?

6031
02:36:36.221 --> 02:36:37.960
Nick Yusuf Nick.

6032
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:40.390
Y.

6033
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
O.

6034
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
U.

6035
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
S.

6036
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
S.

6037
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
E.

6038
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
F.

6039
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:40.390
F.

6040
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:41.223
I liked Nikki.

6041
02:36:41.470 --> 02:36:42.170
Who is bone.

6042
02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:43.003
Good man.

6043
02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:44.230
He'll tell us maybe,

6044
02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:45.280
but does he still hitting it?

6045
02:36:45.310 --> 02:36:46.143
Is that what it is?

6046
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.901
It's been a long time.

6047
02:36:46.901 --> 02:36:47.734
It's been a long time.

6048
02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:48.723
But uh,

6049
02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:49.820
how old is this?

6050
02:36:49.821 --> 02:36:51.010
This young Gal now,

6051
02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:53.133
can we play a game?

6052
02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:53.910
Can we gas?

6053
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:54.530
Can you,

6054
02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:54.880
can you,

6055
02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:55.210
uh,

6056
02:36:55.210 --> 02:36:56.043
give us some wrong,

6057
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:57.220
hold on.

6058
02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.180
Let me do the math in my head.

6059
02:36:58.181 --> 02:36:58.831
If I'm allowed to.

6060
02:36:58.831 --> 02:37:00.790
Like she likes her license means it's coming out.

6061
02:37:00.791 --> 02:37:01.361
If we do that.

6062
02:37:01.361 --> 02:37:03.700
So I'm not even thinking about this.

6063
02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:05.770
The math in your head or whether or not you can get in trouble,

6064
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.410
whether or not this is not the cool or is okay,

6065
02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:11.440
well there's nothing wrong with a little sacks and unless a,

6066
02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:12.370
that's an excellent point.

6067
02:37:12.371 --> 02:37:13.450
She's not supposed to do that.

6068
02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:14.470
That's totally cool.

6069
02:37:14.471 --> 02:37:15.304
And everybody's part.

6070
02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:16.090
I mean it's not like,

6071
02:37:16.090 --> 02:37:16.780
<v 5>okay,</v>

6072
02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:17.710
let's play the guessing game.

6073
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:19.000
She likes Reese's pieces.

6074
02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:20.920
So I'm assuming yes.

6075
02:37:21.130 --> 02:37:21.611
I don't know.

6076
02:37:21.611 --> 02:37:22.330
Idea.

6077
02:37:22.330 --> 02:37:22.991
Let me get her,

6078
02:37:22.991 --> 02:37:23.680
um,

6079
02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:24.610
<v 1>Wikipedia page.</v>

6080
02:37:24.780 --> 02:37:26.380
Um hmm.

6081
02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:29.390
<v 5>She have a lot of stuffed animals in a closet.</v>

6082
02:37:32.090 --> 02:37:32.923
I don't know.

6083
02:37:32.970 --> 02:37:34.020
I haven't had any,

6084
02:37:34.210 --> 02:37:35.150
my sister knew

6085
02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:37.050
<v 1>there's a,</v>

6086
02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:37.861
by the way,

6087
02:37:37.861 --> 02:37:38.461
while we're on the,

6088
02:37:38.461 --> 02:37:39.450
on the way to doing this,

6089
02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:39.700
uh,

6090
02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:41.640
I've talked to you about 51 now.

6091
02:37:42.570 --> 02:37:43.200
Okay.

6092
02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:43.420
What,

6093
02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:44.310
what does she do?

6094
02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:47.550
She's in a lot of music videos.

6095
02:37:47.730 --> 02:37:48.301
She's a singer.

6096
02:37:48.301 --> 02:37:48.911
Paul Abdul.

6097
02:37:48.911 --> 02:37:50.480
He fuck you.

6098
02:37:50.590 --> 02:37:51.423
Fuck Paul Abdul.

6099
02:37:51.690 --> 02:37:52.400
No,

6100
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:53.233
<v 5>he wouldn't fucking Jew.</v>

6101
02:37:53.690 --> 02:37:54.523
Oh,

6102
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:56.340
those are jus the good cause.

6103
02:37:56.341 --> 02:37:57.070
The theory and kind.

6104
02:37:57.070 --> 02:37:58.910
It's like the really good kind of,

6105
02:37:59.010 --> 02:37:59.910
does that mean the hot,

6106
02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.790
don't look Hardik Jews.

6107
02:38:01.791 --> 02:38:03.680
They look more like Persian.

6108
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:06.020
Like Israelis.

6109
02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.080
Israelis really have a lot more as far Jews,

6110
02:38:08.081 --> 02:38:09.380
but it a lot of Ashkenazi Jews there.

6111
02:38:09.381 --> 02:38:09.680
But yeah,

6112
02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:10.610
they're all intermingled.

6113
02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:11.740
Ashkenazi.

6114
02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:12.960
They'd be telling my dad,

6115
02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.980
I guess word but some somebody since he's Ashkenazi,

6116
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.610
he uh,

6117
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:19.130
him and his friend puts somebody in the hospital for dating.

6118
02:38:19.131 --> 02:38:20.930
His sister was far guy.

6119
02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:22.070
Oh my God.

6120
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:25.440
Cause no fucking Sardi is going to date my sister.

6121
02:38:25.970 --> 02:38:28.760
Why hidden is wow.

6122
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:29.150
Yeah.

6123
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:30.800
They beat somebody as a Douche bag.

6124
02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:31.160
Yeah.

6125
02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:32.000
I tell him now he's like,

6126
02:38:32.001 --> 02:38:33.860
I know it was very stupid.

6127
02:38:33.861 --> 02:38:34.150
I get,

6128
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:35.070
I'm watching both.

6129
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:35.391
Is it,

6130
02:38:35.391 --> 02:38:36.230
cause I get it.

6131
02:38:36.231 --> 02:38:38.690
I know now why I was 16.

6132
02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:40.280
How am I supposed send out?

6133
02:38:40.281 --> 02:38:40.350
Oh,

6134
02:38:40.350 --> 02:38:43.380
<v 1>so there's a new thing called the human brain project.</v>

6135
02:38:43.450 --> 02:38:43.830
Yeah.

6136
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:44.663
Check this out.

6137
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:49.110
And they are putting together all the existing no knowledge about the human

6138
02:38:49.111 --> 02:38:53.340
brain and they're trying to reconstruct the brain piece by piece.

6139
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:54.510
And it's super,

6140
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:57.090
super computer based model and simulation.

6141
02:38:57.630 --> 02:39:01.350
The project is actually the latest to be chosen by the European Commission to

6142
02:39:01.351 --> 02:39:04.800
receive funding as a part of the fet flagship initiatives.

6143
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:06.390
So the cerebral challenge,

6144
02:39:06.391 --> 02:39:10.290
we'll be headed up by Switzerland's equal polytechnique,

6145
02:39:10.291 --> 02:39:11.190
whatever the fuck it is.

6146
02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:16.260
And it's estimated to cost 1.1 9 billion euros.

6147
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:19.560
So what these guys are doing is they're,

6148
02:39:19.561 --> 02:39:22.230
they're essentially going to make an artificial brain.

6149
02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:23.310
Wow.

6150
02:39:23.310 --> 02:39:23.910
Wow.

6151
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:24.211
I mean,

6152
02:39:24.211 --> 02:39:27.450
they're spending a fuck load of money and,

6153
02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:27.840
uh,

6154
02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.840
sales 1.1 9 billion is that you're a part of it.

6155
02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:38.940
That translates to dollars is 1.6 $3 billion,

6156
02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:40.650
almost a,

6157
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:41.130
you know,

6158
02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:42.690
more than one and a half billion.

6159
02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:43.800
And it,

6160
02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:44.071
they,

6161
02:39:44.071 --> 02:39:45.710
what they're trying to do is a,

6162
02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.240
they're at advance advanced robotics and,

6163
02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.500
um,

6164
02:39:49.850 --> 02:39:51.240
it's really crazy.

6165
02:39:51.241 --> 02:39:56.220
It's a 10 year project that's a fifth of the time

6166
02:39:59.130 --> 02:40:01.860
required to develop a space liner.

6167
02:40:02.370 --> 02:40:03.300
Whatever the fuck that means.

6168
02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:03.421
Oh,

6169
02:40:03.421 --> 02:40:07.170
that's the other thing that they're trying to build a space liner there.

6170
02:40:07.171 --> 02:40:07.560
Um,

6171
02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:07.771
yeah,

6172
02:40:07.771 --> 02:40:08.850
this is really crazy.

6173
02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:09.661
There's a,

6174
02:40:09.661 --> 02:40:13.420
they're going to be able to go from Europe to Australia in 90 minutes,

6175
02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:14.250
zero

6176
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:15.590
<v 0>touch by going up,</v>

6177
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:16.630
up in space.

6178
02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:17.140
Yeah.

6179
02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:18.550
There what they're going to do is,

6180
02:40:18.551 --> 02:40:18.970
uh,

6181
02:40:18.970 --> 02:40:22.120
the idea is you're going to be able to go supersonic speeds.

6182
02:40:22.690 --> 02:40:23.200
Um,

6183
02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:23.681
and you're,

6184
02:40:23.681 --> 02:40:26.890
you're going to be able to do it just like the Concorde was doing it,

6185
02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:28.240
but they're going to do it and space.

6186
02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:30.130
But how long would it take you just to get the space?

6187
02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:31.061
Um,

6188
02:40:31.061 --> 02:40:32.140
I don't know.

6189
02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:33.163
I have to,

6190
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.080
how does the space shuttle?

6191
02:40:35.081 --> 02:40:35.914
It takes forever to get well,

6192
02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:39.610
they're saying you're going to be able to go from Europe to Australia and down

6193
02:40:39.611 --> 02:40:41.080
and just 90 minutes.

6194
02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:41.710
Wow.

6195
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:44.170
That would make the whole world so much smaller.

6196
02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:44.621
Yeah.

6197
02:40:44.621 --> 02:40:45.670
They're 15 mile.

6198
02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:45.881
They're,

6199
02:40:45.881 --> 02:40:46.540
they're uh,

6200
02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:47.500
50 years out.

6201
02:40:47.501 --> 02:40:50.830
They believe 55 year five zero.

6202
02:40:50.890 --> 02:40:51.071
Yeah.

6203
02:40:51.071 --> 02:40:52.030
It's going to take a long time.

6204
02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:53.410
No,

6205
02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:54.430
you won't hang in there,

6206
02:40:54.431 --> 02:40:55.170
bitch.

6207
02:40:55.170 --> 02:40:58.390
They're going to go 150,000 miles an hour.

6208
02:40:58.690 --> 02:40:59.291
Stop.

6209
02:40:59.291 --> 02:41:02.170
And think about that a hundred thousand miles an hour.

6210
02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.950
That means you can go back and forth across the United States.

6211
02:41:05.951 --> 02:41:07.210
Do you know how fast we go now?

6212
02:41:07.211 --> 02:41:08.044
When you going to plan

6213
02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:11.610
500 so 500

6214
02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:14.080
stopping.

6215
02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:14.910
Thinking about that.

6216
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:15.450
502.

6217
02:41:15.450 --> 02:41:16.140
How much?

6218
02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:18.980
Hundred and 50,000 miles an hour.

6219
02:41:19.450 --> 02:41:22.470
150,000 play right now.

6220
02:41:22.471 --> 02:41:23.700
We'll go twice as fast.

6221
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:26.550
It would still have to go 150 times faster than that.

6222
02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:27.510
The issue right now,

6223
02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:31.350
apparently the problem is creating a design that's capable of tolerating the

6224
02:41:31.351 --> 02:41:32.970
heat generated at such speed.

6225
02:41:33.390 --> 02:41:34.350
Friction from the air.

6226
02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:35.483
Yeah.

6227
02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.593
<v 6>Wow.</v>

6228
02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.113
<v 0>It's amazing.</v>

6229
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:40.463
How does,

6230
02:41:40.650 --> 02:41:41.490
and you know what,

6231
02:41:41.491 --> 02:41:43.080
people are still gonna Bitch about the seats.

6232
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:45.540
Motherfuck can leave your seat back and it'd be gone.

6233
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:46.680
$150,000.

6234
02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.890
No fucking laptop going 150,000 miles an hour.

6235
02:41:50.891 --> 02:41:52.420
I want to use a fucking laptop.

6236
02:41:52.421 --> 02:41:54.130
You fucking cock soccer.

6237
02:41:54.131 --> 02:41:55.030
I'll kick your seat.

6238
02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:58.960
All the TSA wants to check me for bombs while I go 150,000 miles an hour.

6239
02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:00.460
How about let me wear my sneakers.

6240
02:42:00.670 --> 02:42:01.780
I got a medical condition.

6241
02:42:01.781 --> 02:42:02.614
You fucks.

6242
02:42:04.540 --> 02:42:06.040
This is pretty crazy shit man.

6243
02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:07.840
I mean we,

6244
02:42:07.841 --> 02:42:07.981
we're,

6245
02:42:07.981 --> 02:42:08.221
we're,

6246
02:42:08.221 --> 02:42:08.521
we're,

6247
02:42:08.521 --> 02:42:11.560
we're getting a glimpse at the future and when we say 50 years we'd go,

6248
02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:12.071
oh,

6249
02:42:12.071 --> 02:42:13.000
that's so far away.

6250
02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:13.361
Well,

6251
02:42:13.361 --> 02:42:13.780
is it?

6252
02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:17.920
Is it really think about 1960 1960 was 50 years ago.

6253
02:42:18.090 --> 02:42:18.211
Well,

6254
02:42:18.211 --> 02:42:19.650
they look at all these natural disasters,

6255
02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:20.790
tsunamis and stuff,

6256
02:42:20.791 --> 02:42:21.211
and people are like,

6257
02:42:21.211 --> 02:42:21.391
Oh,

6258
02:42:21.391 --> 02:42:21.631
you know,

6259
02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:22.141
I was terrible.

6260
02:42:22.141 --> 02:42:22.590
But if you know,

6261
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:23.610
shit happens or whatever,

6262
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:24.030
and they're like,

6263
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.151
no,

6264
02:42:24.151 --> 02:42:24.330
no,

6265
02:42:24.330 --> 02:42:25.830
this happens every 80 years.

6266
02:42:26.130 --> 02:42:28.990
So all we do is we all die off and then the next generation comes in.

6267
02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:29.191
I'm like,

6268
02:42:29.191 --> 02:42:29.341
oh,

6269
02:42:29.341 --> 02:42:30.400
we could never see this happening.

6270
02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.280
It's like it will continue to happen.

6271
02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:32.551
Yeah.

6272
02:42:32.551 --> 02:42:32.941
They forget,

6273
02:42:32.941 --> 02:42:35.460
I'll quit building up the port or figure out a wall system.

6274
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:40.200
There's nothing you can do if you have to choose to just roll the dice and thing

6275
02:42:40.210 --> 02:42:41.530
of building these breakers,

6276
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:43.590
like go out in the bay out.

6277
02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.700
So it would take like,

6278
02:42:44.701 --> 02:42:45.381
cause some fly,

6279
02:42:45.381 --> 02:42:47.020
but nothing like nothing damaging at all.

6280
02:42:47.050 --> 02:42:48.880
I think that was the idea behind Atlanta's.

6281
02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:49.781
Um,

6282
02:42:49.781 --> 02:42:50.470
and then it fell.

6283
02:42:50.470 --> 02:42:51.040
Yeah.

6284
02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:51.491
Well the,

6285
02:42:51.491 --> 02:42:52.720
the rising sea levels too,

6286
02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:53.171
you know,

6287
02:42:53.171 --> 02:42:55.240
sea levels change radically over time,

6288
02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:57.040
especially with the,

6289
02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:58.520
I mean there's no sir,

6290
02:42:58.570 --> 02:43:03.570
there's absolutely some evidence that points to global warming in some way or

6291
02:43:05.321 --> 02:43:07.450
shape being affected by human beings.

6292
02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:08.463
Absolutely.

6293
02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:12.040
But even if we didn't affect 10

6294
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:12.610
<v 1>minutes,</v>

6295
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:13.720
even if we didn't affect it,

6296
02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:14.830
they've been the,

6297
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:15.131
the,

6298
02:43:15.131 --> 02:43:16.760
the temperature of the earth is very threatened.

6299
02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:17.800
Changes greatly.

6300
02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:19.590
Like the dinosaurs whenever it was.

6301
02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:20.760
The universe opens and closes.

6302
02:43:21.250 --> 02:43:21.870
It does,

6303
02:43:21.870 --> 02:43:23.100
it's like a balloon or whatever.

6304
02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:23.280
The,

6305
02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:23.410
the,

6306
02:43:23.410 --> 02:43:23.561
the,

6307
02:43:23.561 --> 02:43:23.801
you know,

6308
02:43:23.801 --> 02:43:26.290
the fucking son's going to brown and destroy us all anyway,

6309
02:43:26.291 --> 02:43:26.650
one day,

6310
02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:27.640
5 billion years from now,

6311
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:29.380
according to our pile and to grass.

6312
02:43:29.390 --> 02:43:30.223
Tyson.

6313
02:43:30.270 --> 02:43:35.270
Neil had some amazing Superbowl quotes the other day while the people were,

6314
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:35.860
uh,

6315
02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:38.200
well he was tweeting super bowl stuff,

6316
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:41.740
but it was like cool fuckers and science super bowl stuff.

6317
02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:42.701
I see.

6318
02:43:42.701 --> 02:43:43.121
I should,

6319
02:43:43.121 --> 02:43:43.510
uh,

6320
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:45.880
I should pull some of mob because they were fucking awesome,

6321
02:43:45.881 --> 02:43:46.210
man.

6322
02:43:46.210 --> 02:43:47.000
Let me find it.

6323
02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:47.530
But he's,

6324
02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:49.330
what is he in end Tyson on Twitter.

6325
02:43:49.450 --> 02:43:50.170
Neil Tyson,

6326
02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:51.003
Tyson.

6327
02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:52.691
And by the way,

6328
02:43:52.691 --> 02:43:54.190
everybody in North Carolina.

6329
02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:54.610
Um,

6330
02:43:54.610 --> 02:43:55.211
I'll be in Raleigh,

6331
02:43:55.211 --> 02:43:56.350
North Carolina this weekend.

6332
02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:59.470
So don't you guys don't get my special until I'm there.

6333
02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:00.551
Oh,

6334
02:44:00.551 --> 02:44:01.750
why is it the same material?

6335
02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.050
Well,

6336
02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:04.750
I have like 20 different material.

6337
02:44:04.751 --> 02:44:05.120
It's funny.

6338
02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:05.921
25 different.

6339
02:44:05.921 --> 02:44:06.041
Yeah,

6340
02:44:06.041 --> 02:44:06.551
it's hard,

6341
02:44:06.551 --> 02:44:07.120
isn't it?

6342
02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:08.980
But they'll still be like 25.

6343
02:44:08.981 --> 02:44:12.310
I'm doing some gigs just to fuck around.

6344
02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:13.090
Um,

6345
02:44:13.090 --> 02:44:15.500
specifically to work on new material.

6346
02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:16.670
Like I've got a few lines.

6347
02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:17.500
That's really smart.

6348
02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:17.801
Yeah.

6349
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:19.880
I'm doing xannies and a Nashville,

6350
02:44:19.881 --> 02:44:20.980
which is a nice small club.

6351
02:44:20.981 --> 02:44:24.430
I'm going to do that over a whole weekend this weekend.

6352
02:44:24.490 --> 02:44:24.970
Um,

6353
02:44:24.970 --> 02:44:25.421
me,

6354
02:44:25.421 --> 02:44:30.190
Brian and Joey Diaz are going to be in West Palm Beach,

6355
02:44:30.250 --> 02:44:31.083
Florida.

6356
02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:33.190
You fuckheads giant room.

6357
02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:33.551
Yeah,

6358
02:44:33.551 --> 02:44:34.384
it's giant.

6359
02:44:34.470 --> 02:44:35.303
It's awesome though.

6360
02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:39.700
It's a great room and tickets are selling very fast.

6361
02:44:39.701 --> 02:44:41.140
It's almost sold out most of the show,

6362
02:44:41.141 --> 02:44:42.130
so that'll be cool.

6363
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:43.570
Get on that shit freaks.

6364
02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:44.321
I liked these markers.

6365
02:44:44.321 --> 02:44:48.430
You have that your draw is getting better where you've returned to a place.

6366
02:44:48.431 --> 02:44:50.650
Like in Calgary we did that Jack singer Paul,

6367
02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:51.161
and it was like,

6368
02:44:51.161 --> 02:44:52.090
we filled it up eventually.

6369
02:44:52.090 --> 02:44:53.050
We got it filled up the first time.

6370
02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:55.060
This time two shows sold out in advance.

6371
02:44:55.150 --> 02:44:55.840
Yeah.

6372
02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:56.261
And it was like,

6373
02:44:56.261 --> 02:44:56.531
wow,

6374
02:44:56.531 --> 02:44:58.360
that's a clear sign of stuff getting better.

6375
02:44:58.390 --> 02:45:01.570
You just sold out Montreal and like 50 minutes didn't issue or something like

6376
02:45:01.571 --> 02:45:01.841
that.

6377
02:45:01.841 --> 02:45:02.491
I heard that.

6378
02:45:02.491 --> 02:45:03.400
Well that was like a small,

6379
02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:04.393
it's,

6380
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:08.770
it's my friend Jim Vose club because I was just there a couple months ago and I

6381
02:45:08.771 --> 02:45:09.730
did a big theater.

6382
02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:10.451
Uh,

6383
02:45:10.451 --> 02:45:10.961
I did,

6384
02:45:10.961 --> 02:45:11.650
um,

6385
02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:13.130
I forgot this metropolis is a tropical.

6386
02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:13.740
Yeah.

6387
02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:14.950
Big Ass fucking place,

6388
02:45:14.951 --> 02:45:16.210
like a couple of thousand people.

6389
02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:18.420
So from that to two,

6390
02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:19.540
this is a,

6391
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:21.820
I did a Jim Jimbos place because first of all,

6392
02:45:21.821 --> 02:45:22.654
I love Jimbo.

6393
02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:24.100
I've been working for him.

6394
02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:25.060
It goes off.

6395
02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:25.361
Yeah.

6396
02:45:25.361 --> 02:45:26.440
It's a crazy little club.

6397
02:45:26.441 --> 02:45:27.940
80 people in a room.

6398
02:45:27.941 --> 02:45:28.774
It should seat 40.

6399
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:29.660
Yeah,

6400
02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:30.493
it's awesome.

6401
02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.110
It's just such a great experience.

6402
02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:32.973
It's great.

6403
02:45:33.070 --> 02:45:33.610
And a,

6404
02:45:33.610 --> 02:45:34.570
it's going to be you and me,

6405
02:45:34.571 --> 02:45:34.830
right?

6406
02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:35.291
You're doing it.

6407
02:45:35.291 --> 02:45:35.590
Yeah.

6408
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:37.690
We're going to have to say it's going to be such a good time.

6409
02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:39.280
It's going to be so fun and it,

6410
02:45:39.281 --> 02:45:42.490
the place couldn't be cooler in the pub downstairs is amazing.

6411
02:45:42.491 --> 02:45:44.050
Everybody works here as cool as fuck.

6412
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:47.050
And a lot of the same guys that have been working there since the beginning of

6413
02:45:47.051 --> 02:45:47.710
time.

6414
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:48.221
So let me,

6415
02:45:48.221 --> 02:45:49.120
this is our tender.

6416
02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:50.080
Some of the tweets,

6417
02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:51.820
the tweets that,

6418
02:45:51.821 --> 02:45:52.300
uh,

6419
02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:52.601
he,

6420
02:45:52.601 --> 02:45:53.434
uh,

6421
02:45:53.770 --> 02:45:54.160
he,

6422
02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:55.180
he wrote about,

6423
02:45:55.181 --> 02:45:55.380
uh,

6424
02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:57.820
if grid irons were Tom Neil degrasse Tyson wrote this.

6425
02:45:58.030 --> 02:46:03.030
If grid irons were timelines with the big bang at one goal and then from caveman

6426
02:46:04.211 --> 02:46:09.211
to now with span the thickness of a single turf blade at the other goal.

6427
02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:11.780
Isn't that amazing?

6428
02:46:11.781 --> 02:46:16.781
Like you would go from the big bang through the entire football field and then

6429
02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:21.950
one turf flavor caveman to us would be one blade of grass.

6430
02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:22.460
Wow.

6431
02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:25.430
One tiny thing that you can't even see when you're looking at it.

6432
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.950
Yeah,

6433
02:46:25.950 --> 02:46:27.140
he's super bowl.

6434
02:46:27.170 --> 02:46:28.070
He's cool as fuck.

6435
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.490
We'll have to get him back in here again and I proved it.

6436
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.903
Landing Talk.

6437
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:32.141
Yeah.

6438
02:46:32.141 --> 02:46:33.020
Well if we could,

6439
02:46:33.021 --> 02:46:33.900
I believe he's a,

6440
02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:34.850
he's in New York resident,

6441
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:38.510
but he's out here doing the new version of the cosmos,

6442
02:46:38.511 --> 02:46:40.010
which is going to be fucking amazing.

6443
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:41.810
And he just hit a million twitters,

6444
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.831
Twitter followers.

6445
02:46:42.831 --> 02:46:43.581
So follow him.

6446
02:46:43.581 --> 02:46:44.510
It's Neil Tyson,

6447
02:46:44.511 --> 02:46:46.190
n e I l Tyson on Twitter.

6448
02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:49.670
And you could fall Ari Shaffir and if you work for the Tsa you can give him a

6449
02:46:49.671 --> 02:46:50.504
rash of shit.

6450
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:51.583
Fuck,

6451
02:46:52.930 --> 02:46:54.080
I'm going to try to be calmer.

6452
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.900
Ff I are,

6453
02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:55.733
he's going to be calmer.

6454
02:46:55.970 --> 02:46:56.301
But uh,

6455
02:46:56.301 --> 02:46:57.920
you can get revenge for the Holocaust.

6456
02:46:57.921 --> 02:47:01.020
This is the CD and it's available right now to get them together.

6457
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:04.280
They had these bundles so you can get a poster or the CD and on the special

6458
02:47:04.410 --> 02:47:04.930
offer.

6459
02:47:04.930 --> 02:47:08.750
So you get two hours of juicy fucking rhe fear material.

6460
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.711
Go get some.

6461
02:47:09.711 --> 02:47:14.711
You're dirty Fox and a if you want to see juicy red band and juicy Joey Coco

6462
02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:15.673
Diaz was pompous.

6463
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:18.590
It's harder and harder to get Joey Coco Diaz to open for me folks,

6464
02:47:18.591 --> 02:47:20.060
cause the dude is just blowing up.

6465
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:21.560
We start on no for you even show up.

6466
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:22.191
It's working around.

6467
02:47:22.191 --> 02:47:26.210
This podcast has done so much for all of us,

6468
02:47:26.211 --> 02:47:28.790
but Joey is a fucking monster now.

6469
02:47:28.850 --> 02:47:29.331
I mean he's,

6470
02:47:29.331 --> 02:47:31.400
he's really taken off like crazy this coming weekend.

6471
02:47:31.401 --> 02:47:31.911
You're in the restaurant?

6472
02:47:31.911 --> 02:47:32.001
Yeah,

6473
02:47:32.001 --> 02:47:32.834
this coming weekend.

6474
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.711
Can't wait.

6475
02:47:33.711 --> 02:47:35.390
Your Fox and a yeah.

6476
02:47:35.391 --> 02:47:40.391
If you bought my special recently on Joe rogan.net it will be 100% new material.

6477
02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:41.600
None of that material is on.

6478
02:47:41.601 --> 02:47:45.980
I already have an hour and 20 minutes of new shit because I don't play bitches.

6479
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.551
Okay.

6480
02:47:46.551 --> 02:47:48.530
I got an isolation tank in my basement.

6481
02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:49.580
That's really good too.

6482
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:50.181
Thanks man.

6483
02:47:50.181 --> 02:47:50.340
I'm,

6484
02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:51.230
I'm excited about it.

6485
02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.110
There's a couple of stuff's really good.

6486
02:47:54.111 --> 02:47:54.530
Vegan,

6487
02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:54.711
Bitsa,

6488
02:47:54.711 --> 02:47:55.040
favorite.

6489
02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:56.970
My favorite bit of ever around my favorite.

6490
02:47:56.971 --> 02:47:57.804
It's my favorite.

6491
02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.840
So glad I'm so that that is partly in faithful to you because you reminded me of

6492
02:48:04.701 --> 02:48:05.450
that pit.

6493
02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:05.990
You know,

6494
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:07.280
you reminded me of that bit.

6495
02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:11.210
Actually I got to give you 100% credit cause I probably would have forgotten who

6496
02:48:11.211 --> 02:48:11.811
wrote it.

6497
02:48:11.811 --> 02:48:12.680
Kicked some credit.

6498
02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:13.793
Okay.

6499
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:15.230
Credit for its resurgence.

6500
02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:17.090
But it's even good.

6501
02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:19.100
It's even better now that way.

6502
02:48:19.101 --> 02:48:22.940
Better now the girl with the no vagina.

6503
02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:25.040
So

6504
02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:27.441
folks,

6505
02:48:27.441 --> 02:48:29.090
we're going to have some fucking fun.

6506
02:48:29.170 --> 02:48:29.541
All right.

6507
02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:31.660
And we will see you tomorrow night with our friends.

6508
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:33.080
The real Rick Ross,

6509
02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:33.801
the root cause,

6510
02:48:33.801 --> 02:48:35.360
the real Rick Ross is not a rapper.

6511
02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:36.710
I know you didn't know that,

6512
02:48:36.711 --> 02:48:38.360
but you're gonna know that if you didn't know that already,

6513
02:48:38.361 --> 02:48:39.140
he's a great guy.

6514
02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:40.940
And when you've got some cool shit to talk to him about it,

6515
02:48:40.941 --> 02:48:41.450
he's just,

6516
02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:42.490
he's a really interesting guy.

6517
02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:44.300
Used to be a big time drug dealers.

6518
02:48:44.301 --> 02:48:46.880
Now he's a community activist and just a really cool,

6519
02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:48.800
nice sweet guy to talk to.

6520
02:48:48.801 --> 02:48:50.750
And I'm psyched to sit down and talk to them.

6521
02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:52.370
And there's a dude out there using this name,

6522
02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:54.200
that big fat Rick Ross got a wrapper.

6523
02:48:54.201 --> 02:48:54.681
That guy's not,

6524
02:48:54.681 --> 02:48:56.720
he's not real real was William Roberts.

6525
02:48:56.721 --> 02:48:57.560
It's not Rick Ross.

6526
02:48:57.770 --> 02:49:01.970
The real Rick Ross was a drug kingpin went to jail for selling cocaine during

6527
02:49:01.971 --> 02:49:03.430
the Iran contra scan.

6528
02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:04.190
You know,

6529
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:05.570
the Iran Contra scandal,

6530
02:49:05.930 --> 02:49:06.640
you know,

6531
02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:07.500
you know how the uh,

6532
02:49:07.501 --> 02:49:07.711
the,

6533
02:49:07.711 --> 02:49:11.400
they were selling coke and they were using the money to fund the,

6534
02:49:11.401 --> 02:49:11.671
uh,

6535
02:49:11.671 --> 02:49:11.851
the,

6536
02:49:11.851 --> 02:49:12.121
you know,

6537
02:49:12.121 --> 02:49:12.261
the,

6538
02:49:12.261 --> 02:49:12.730
the war,

6539
02:49:12.730 --> 02:49:14.350
the consciousness versus uh,

6540
02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:15.600
the Sandinistas.

6541
02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:17.070
That was Rick Ross.

6542
02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:19.890
He's the one who sold the code was the one who was selling a coke on the streets

6543
02:49:19.891 --> 02:49:20.724
in La.

6544
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.710
Yes.

6545
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.981
Yeah.

6546
02:49:22.981 --> 02:49:25.170
So like you've had the governor for coke and then sell it.

6547
02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:26.450
There was a middle man.

6548
02:49:26.450 --> 02:49:27.720
He didn't realize it at the time,

6549
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:29.970
but it was his coke selling.

6550
02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:30.241
I mean,

6551
02:49:30.241 --> 02:49:31.420
he was selling millions of dollars.

6552
02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:31.560
Like,

6553
02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:31.890
what'd you cook?

6554
02:49:31.890 --> 02:49:36.810
This looks good stuff because funding covert operations overseas,

6555
02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:37.471
he's amazing.

6556
02:49:37.471 --> 02:49:38.161
He's a patriot,

6557
02:49:38.161 --> 02:49:38.670
really,

6558
02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:39.300
in a way.

6559
02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:40.380
If you think we should've gone there.

6560
02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.610
I couldn't even read at the time.

6561
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:42.241
It was amazing.

6562
02:49:42.241 --> 02:49:45.060
He was making millions dollars and he couldn't read and went to jail and learned

6563
02:49:45.061 --> 02:49:46.440
how to read and became a lawyer in jail.

6564
02:49:46.441 --> 02:49:46.860
He said,

6565
02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:47.401
fascinating.

6566
02:49:47.401 --> 02:49:48.061
Fascinating guy.

6567
02:49:48.061 --> 02:49:48.900
He'll be on tomorrow.

6568
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.501
All right.

6569
02:49:49.501 --> 02:49:50.180
You dirty freak.

6570
02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:51.000
That's an aggressive,

6571
02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.190
please go ahead and work alternative.

6572
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:55.230
There will be no podcast.

6573
02:49:55.231 --> 02:49:55.801
I'm going,

6574
02:49:55.801 --> 02:49:57.210
I'm going out of town for the week.

6575
02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.120

6577

6578
02:50:01.051 --> 02:50:01.481

6579
02:50:01.481 --> 02:50:01.890
Oh yeah.

6582
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.890
I'm going to meditate,

6583
02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:05.611

6584
02:50:05.611 --> 02:50:07.590
I'm not going to do step foot inside this place.

6585
