00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.633
Ah,

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.430

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.620
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and entering

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.550
the code name,
Rogan,
you will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men.

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.130
A sex toy that Duncan Trussell my guest has put his penis into.

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.801
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:29.801
but you did a dude only like only 15 times.

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.753
<v 3>Only 50 times.</v>

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.700
Didn't you get tossed out and not by you that,
oh yeah,
that's happened.

10
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.340
I've got weird.
A lot of weird fleshlight stories I know.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.300
And his life.
Women resent having that around.
Yeah,

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.880
<v 2>don't they?
A lot of them,
not all of them,</v>

13
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:49.390
but there's a few women who look at that as almost like a minor league woman.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.890
<v 3>Well,
they get,
yeah,
they get definitely get ties to,
I mean also there,</v>

15
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.340
the problem is this gross to them.
It's,

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.390
I think it's also a little embarrassing because it's like you don't want someone

17
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:05.370
to open up your asshole.
And I can,
when they come over like,
Hey,
what's this?

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.000
What's this?
It can't,
oh,
there's an ass hole.
So large fosters

19
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.690
good hosts,
opens it up and it's just
fucking,

20
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.820
the Jays pubes are on it.
His pubes

21
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.300
<v 2>so embarrassing if you went,</v>

22
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:24.480
came into your husband's a office and use flashlights.

23
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.640
<v 1>Yeah,
exactly.
What you got to hide.
I'm like,
yeah,
you got to hide them.</v>

24
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:30.770
You can't leave him out in the open.
No one,
no one.

25
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:31.740
Everyone knows that's not [inaudible]

26
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.110
<v 2>fosters cam.
But they work so good.
It's so much better than beating off.</v>

27
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.530
You know?
And if everybody,
it's,

28
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:41.160
it's a weird thing to get behind because if everybody beats off,
why,
why,

29
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.570
why is it so embarrassing to,
to have like technology that aids your beat?

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.650
<v 1>Was that embarrassing?</v>

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.340
Can I tell you my theory about how applied it's better than beating off cause I

32
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.550
think that,
uh,
over the course of evolution,

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.580
I think if if first beating off trick your body and to thinking you'd fucked,

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.340
like you beat off your body got the same satisfied feeling you get when you

35
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.500
fucked right.
And then body started figuring out,

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.090
oh wait a minute is trick me or not really reproducing.

37
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.650
And so then it makes it so when you jerk off,
it feels great,

38
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.350
but it doesn't feel as good as fucking,
it's not the same.

39
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.920
You don't get that same feeling of like,
I just had sex.

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.140
<v 2>Well you also,
you know,
I do a whole bit about it.
How you can feel your hand.</v>

41
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.340
Yeah.
It's a problem.
You can't

42
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.900
<v 3>really hard to trick yourself,</v>

43
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.220
but the fleshlight I think it tricks your body actually the animal part of your

44
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.250
body and your body thinks he fucked because you,
yeah,
you should

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.950
<v 2>loads.
Yeah.
You don't shoot the kind of,
you don't shoot the pinstripe floats.</v>

46
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.300
Beat off.
Loads are not as satisfying though.
You know,

47
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.790
you get a beat off low and you're like,
that's it.
That's all I have in me.

48
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.050
That's it.
That's all I was able to muster up.

49
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.430
<v 3>Well,
it's funny when you're coming inside a flashlight and guys,</v>

50
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.750
I'm sorry to get dirty,
but when you're coming inside a flashlight and you're,

51
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.340
you're,
you're pushing forward into the fleshlight and spraying Jay's into it,

52
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.740
your body thinks it's getting something pregnant.

53
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.220
Your body really thinks it does.
Yeah.
It's kind sad and it really

54
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 4>thinks it's getting a good specimen because it's tight and to see like,
oh,</v>

55
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.420
this is good genes here.
Yeah,
this is a good vagina.

56
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.690
<v 1>The one you get,
the last one you gave me.
I mean,
I,
I don't want to be a bad one.</v>

57
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.010
Well,
I mean with all due respect,
it looks like Frankenstein.

58
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.360
It's Halloween

59
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.383
<v 4>themed one.</v>

60
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.700
<v 1>It's a vagina that's got stitches.
What appears or no?
Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.430
<v 4>Oh,
anyway,</v>

62
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.730
you got to Joe rogan.net and click does a longest fleshlight commercial ever.

63
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.160
Go to Joe rogan.net.

64
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:39.330
Click on the link and enter in the code name Brogan and you get 15% off and
yeah,

65
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:42.660
it's silly.
Yeah,
it's a silly thing.
But if you like beating off,

66
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.910
this is better and everybody likes beating off,

67
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.940
so go buy some [inaudible] were also brought to you by onnit.com uh,

68
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.370
makers of Alpha brain,
uh,
which is,
uh,

69
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.290
a point of contention on the Internet.
There's a lot of people,
uh,

70
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.530
who,
uh,
don't like the idea behind it.

71
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.460
A lot of people say there's not enough science behind it.
Yeah,

72
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.720
I see a lot of your points.
I really do.
However,
people have been taking these,

73
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.460
these,
these plant compounds,
they've been taking these,
you know,

74
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:18.300
these different extracts from,
from plants for a long time.
I mean for,

75
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.740
there's like a recorded use of like velvet bean of,
of thousands of years.

76
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.573
People have been using it.

77
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.720
I don't know if it can have adverse effect on anything cause I'm not a fucking

78
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:32.640
scientist,
but I've looked at it and it's,
it's worth it to me to take a chance.

79
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.241
I've,
I've,

80
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:37.770
I've looked at the data and I know how to use some of the things like Coleen on

81
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:42.090
Alzheimer's patients and man,
when I take it,
I,
I feel good.

82
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.470
It gives me a nice little,
a little bump or something.
And you know,

83
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.120
a lot of people say doesn't do shit for them.

84
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.510
And other people have even said that it makes,
it makes them sick.

85
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.070
Like it makes them feel nauseous.
So I guess,
you know the human body and look,

86
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.130
everybody's not the same.
Some people can't drink coffee.
I fucking love coffee.

87
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.190
You know,
some people can't have milk,
they'll lactose intolerant.
I mean,

88
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.050
I don't know what,
what,
you know,
it's,
if,
if something has an effect on you,

89
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.630
you know,
like this Alpha brain stuff does.

90
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.160
It's got a not jive with everybody.
It's just that's the way it is.

91
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:17.890
There's no other way around it,
in my opinion.
Probably,
you know,
I,

92
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.210
I don't know what,
what each person's individual sensitivities are.
Yeah.

93
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.510
But I do know that for a lot of people it does a lot of good.

94
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.970
<v 1>You know,
what's weird man?
It's like what you're just saying,
like,
you know,
it,</v>

95
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:33.610
it probably interfaces with people's bodies differently in some of them might

96
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.440
feel some nausea.
Yeah.
Pharmaceutical companies,
when they release products,

97
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.820
they know,
oh yeah,

98
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:44.170
there's going to be like 600 people who get seriously fucked up from this shit

99
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:45.580
because that's why they have to run that stuff.

100
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:48.290
And the commercials and the pharmaceutical commercials,
you know,

101
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.240
they say may cause death or serious homicidal thoughts,

102
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.470
suicidal thoughts.

103
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.590
Can you imagine a releasing something like that into the world and knowing,
no.

104
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:58.150
Yeah.
This is going to kill some people.

105
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.380
<v 5>Some people.
Yeah,</v>

106
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.080
that's an interesting point because it's like not everything is,

107
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.200
no one is exactly like someone else.

108
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.570
Like as far as like how their body processes things.

109
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.080
We all know people who literally can't drink alcohol for whatever reason.

110
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.140
Their body just doesn't process it.
Right.
And they go fucking off the wires.
Yeah.

111
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.690
Right.
Yup.
And then we know you or I,
who can,
you know,
have a couple beers.

112
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.540
I've seen you drunk,
you're just Dunkin drunk,
you know,

113
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.840
you're you when you're drunk,
drunk and trust yet drug.
He trusts me.

114
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.260
Well how about the thing he did for me,
we've talked about this before,

115
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.890
but just if you haven't seen it,
you got to go online and watch drunk history.

116
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.280
Dunkin does this drunk history with Nikola Tesla and it's fucking brilliant.

117
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.160
They get him hammered where he's throwing up in a toilet and he's talking about

118
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:48.010
the history of one of my personal heroes.
You know,
one of my shell,

119
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.950
I don't want to say heroes,

120
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:53.000
but one of the people that's been a fixture of my life,

121
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:54.170
one of my people,

122
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:58.220
the men that lived at a most fascinated by is that Nikola Tesla.

123
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:01.070
So it's a fucking awesome thing.
We've talked about it before,
but go see it.

124
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:04.850
If you haven't seen it,
go look it up on Youtube.
It's a fucking awesome,
you know?

125
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.870
Um,
but yeah,
everybody's bodies fucking different,
man.
You know,
some people,

126
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.470
some people can't smoke weed,
some people love it.
David tell doesn't like it.

127
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.040
Doug.
Stan hope doesn't like it.
Right.
You know?
Yeah.
And this is brilliant people,

128
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.720
you know,
I don't ever love and respect him and my,

129
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.840
everybody's body is different man.
People,
some people can't eat fucking walnuts.

130
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.550
You know,
I have a friend of candied walnuts when it doesn't.

131
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:30.420
Brian Keaulana of a Brazil nut fucking thing.
He's got zilch.
You know,

132
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.830
sloppy kitchens are,
you get one little nice salad.
By mistake.

133
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:37.520
I mean condoms in there.
Yeah.
I think Brian Callan is allergic to Brazil nuts.

134
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.570
I'm pretty sure it's set it,
I think it was him.
I don't want to,
I'll have to ask,

135
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.210
but you know,
it's just some wacky shit man.
It's not,
it doesn't,

136
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.070
everybody's body is not the same.

137
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.310
But all this stuff in Alpha brain I think is relatively innocuous.

138
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.270
And I think it,
if you don't like the effects of it,
you can get off of it.

139
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.050
It's real simple.
If it,
it might not work for you.
And if you,
if,

140
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.840
and then I always say this and people say you don't really mean this,

141
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.940
I fucking do mean this.
What I'm about to say,

142
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.330
if you worry at all about how much across,
don't buy it.

143
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.980
Just go look into nootropics,
try a bunch of the other shit.
What's that called?

144
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.400
Stuff called Parasso.
Tim,
that's a really interesting one.
There's,

145
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.281
there's a bunch of,

146
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:20.000
there's a focus factor that they have their own compounds they put together and

147
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.610
there's a bunch of other ones.
Man,
there's some interesting stuff.

148
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.940
It's interesting.
If I had nothing to do with this financially,

149
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:29.720
I would still tell you to try it out because it's fascinating and I've always

150
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.380
endorsed nootropics,
I think.
I think there's some science behind it.

151
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.910
I think there's,
there's a,

152
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.930
there's not enough to like firmly state exactly what each one does.

153
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.270
Unequivocably you know,
this is how you can measure it.
This is the exact dose.

154
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.450
It's not like,
you know,
I don't think it's that clean yet.
It's,
it's,
there's,

155
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.880
there's just a lot of anecdotal evidence that this stuff does.

156
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:57.780
Something to enhance the way your works.
Not,
not crazy.

157
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.690
It's not limitless.
It's not,
it's not a fucking magic pill.

158
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:05.190
It doesn't make retards intelligent.
It's,
it's just a little better.

159
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.830
I'm trying to not say retarded anymore.

160
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.190
<v 1>Oh yeah.
You're cutting that word out of your vagina,</v>

161
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.480
<v 5>Larry,
just to,
just to shut people up,
man.
It's a,
it's a great word,
but you know,</v>

162
00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:17.470
automatically it becomes babies with down syndrome.
Right.

163
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.480
It becomes the worst possible definition for it.
Right.
You know,

164
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.710
you don't mean it like that though.
It's clean your time.
No,
I don't.
Anyway,

165
00:09:24.711 --> 00:09:25.521
if you go to a,

166
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:29.900
what does the music plan a go to on a.com and enter in the code name Brogan Tri

167
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.450
Alpha brain.
And what I was saying is if you don't,
if this is what I,

168
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.510
what I was saying,
that seems like,
I don't really mean,

169
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:38.480
but I really do mean if you think it costs too much,
go by the,

170
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.220
the quantities of the ingredients or whatever the fuck is in Alpha brain is we

171
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:45.470
show it online,
just copy it,
copy it,

172
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.700
go buy the shit and try it out yourself or try one or two of them out yourself.

173
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.910
Some of them you're not going to like,
and some of them you might like,
I think,

174
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.200
you know,
it's,
it's a very interesting sort of a pursuit,

175
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.680
the pursuit of enhancing mental function through nutrients.

176
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.230
But I'm a big believer in vitamins and minerals.
I think it's,

177
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.600
it's enhanced my body and I'm very much in tune with my body because I eat well

178
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:13.580
and I exercise.
And I think it's very important that you know,
you do that,

179
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:15.860
you've got to take care of the fucking machine that carries you around.

180
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.170
So for me,
I'm pretty tuned in to what my body feels like an irregular basis.

181
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.240
And because of that,
I can,

182
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.650
I can get a good feel of when something's helping me for real or something's a

183
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:32.540
placebo effect,
you know,
it's,
um,
it's a real fine line,
you know,

184
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:35.060
because quite honestly,
man,
placebo is a powerful,

185
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:37.990
powerful effect and we don't really understand.
I,

186
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.680
I wouldn't mind really placebos all day if they just rocked my world.

187
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.130
You know?
I mean,
when you think about what the human body is really capable of,

188
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:50.210
and I'm not endorsing lying to people,
but I'm saying,
I mean,

189
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:52.850
think about what the effect of Placebo is.
A,
for a lot of people,

190
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:56.720
it's really fucking dramatic,
man.
They act as if they've gotten medicine.

191
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.620
You know,
cancer has been a,
and I,
I,
it's ever been cured,
but it's,

192
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:04.580
tumors have shrunk,
you know?
Uh,
is that true?
Look that up.

193
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.160
Looked at it shrunk.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm,

194
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.550
I'm not 100% sure I heard that.
That's a good thing to look at.

195
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.000
But I know that it's,

196
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.500
I know that there have been some substantial medical improvements because of the

197
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:20.300
placebo effect,
and it's a fascinating effect.

198
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.820
I wish someone could just placebo me all day.

199
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.510
I wish you could just convince me that I could go to some lady and she wipes me

200
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:30.800
with a chicken's foot and you know,
and your,
your liver liver heals up.
You know,

201
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:31.790
I wish I,
you know,

202
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.060
I wish it was possible to just trigger placebos left and right.
Well,
somebody

203
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.790
<v 1>emailed me.
Something else you could maybe check out Brian,</v>

204
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:40.280
is that they think that it might be,
there might be,
you know,

205
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:42.470
there's natural cannabinoids in the brain.
Yeah.

206
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.280
And they think it's somehow associated with that brain just releases these

207
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.150
cannabinoids and it gives you a,
I'm just saying,
ah,
assholes with tumors on him.

208
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.100
Hmm.
I'll take,
I'll take the word.
I'll take

209
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.790
<v 5>the word butthole hole.
Out of that.
You always did.</v>

210
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.240
He had butthole to every Google search.
It does.
This is a grown man.

211
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.650
Anyway.
If you go to Joe Rogan dot.
And then you click on the link for that.
Oh.

212
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.900
And the other thing is Alpha brain,
if you don't like it,

213
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.630
it's a hundred percent money back guarantee.
Even if you've eaten it.

214
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.510
If you take by,
especially by 30 pills,

215
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.070
the small ones just take it and if you don't like it,
you get your money back.

216
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.480
Even if you eat it and that's the best thing because I mean honestly what you

217
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.390
can't get mad at that you can't get mad.
That's all we can do.

218
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.750
All we can do is be as honest as possible.

219
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.880
Tell you get the 30 cal get the small amount.
If you don't like it,
send it back.

220
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:37.630
We give you all your money back 100% I can tell you eaten every single pill.

221
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.520
My grandmother

222
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.610
<v 1>there died and I put Alpha brain into her mouth and she came back to life.</v>

223
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.200
I heard that shit.
I heard that.
Yeah,
it will bring your grandmother back to life,

224
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.880
<v 5>but they can't be dead for that long.
Like how long?
What do you mean?</v>

225
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.910
How long was she dead for?
Oh,
it wasn't like a week.
No,
it was like three.

226
00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:00.650
It's a couple of days.
She did.
Then we were at his board.

227
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.340
Her corpse had been laying there for a while and I'm like,
fuck it.

228
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.280
Put Alpha for Brandon her mouth.
Anyway,
my,
my uh,
tennis.

229
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.970
Please don't buy off of brain.
If you have any questions,
don't buy it.

230
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.410
Please don't.
Don't,
don't buy it.
I don't want you to buy it.
If you're thinking,

231
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.490
should I buy this shit,
please don't buy it.
Okay?
But look into nootropics.

232
00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:20.420
Just look it up online.

233
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.180
It's a fascinating thing and if you want to buy Alpha brain,

234
00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:26.090
go to [inaudible] dot com work for me.
It gave me weird dreams.
The code name,

235
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.960
Rogan,
and you get 10% off that shit.
Bitch.
Duncan trussell's here.

236
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.970
Let the music begin.
We're in the new desk squad studio experience.
Try my day.

237
00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:37.560
Joe Rogan podcast,
my night all day.

238
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.360
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

239
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.661
<v 5>I had a pink,</v>

240
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:52.661
somebody on my board yesterday for complaining that I do the commercials before

241
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:57.740
the podcast.
You know,
he was bitching about it.
Something like these stupid fuck.

242
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.170
Go to the special ed room,
dummy.
It's ridiculous.
I'll give you a free podcast,

243
00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:05.420
man.
I have to,

244
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.430
I have to do something to monetize this bitch,
right?
Yeah.

245
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.290
And Cart bandwidth costs money.

246
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.910
It's really fucking annoying when people give you those like con those types

247
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.740
plane about something.

248
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:23.390
When I give you something for two and a half hours for free and I'm just talking

249
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:25.970
about,
you know,
a product for two minutes,

250
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.720
you're getting commercial man,
here's a

251
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.200
<v 1>comment I just got on a youtube video.
Let me see if I remember.</v>

252
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:34.430
It was really annoying.
What I,
these are the,

253
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.300
these are the fucking car and salt comments I selling out.

254
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.670
They're the ones that start with a compliment,
but her passive,

255
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.350
the passive aggressive ones.
So this one was,

256
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:46.580
I like for 20 minutes I took the paranormal activity,

257
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.870
you know how paranormal activity shows,
um,
the crowd and doesn't show the,

258
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.440
so it's the crowd reacting to paranormal activity if you,
you seen that.

259
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.550
So it's like people are like,
oh no.
And I thought,
well fuck man,
that's funny.

260
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.480
I wonder what that would look like if they were reacting to a red lobster

261
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.750
commercial.
So I just put a red lobster commercial on top of them,

262
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:09.740
like freaking out over a scary movie.
And it came out kind of funny,
weird.

263
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.850
And so I put that up on my youtube page and someone left the comments like,

264
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.010
well,
this is uh,
this is the only one of your videos that didn't make me laugh.

265
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.270
Why would you even fucking say that?
It's like a compliment,
uh,

266
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.410
in very nice complement.
Makes them,
it's just like a Shitty Jab.

267
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.940
<v 5>He gave me a check minus.
Well,
you know what it is,</v>

268
00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:31.530
is when you get on the Internet,

269
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.860
you are allowing yourself to interact with anybody,

270
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.210
anybody and everybody.
And you're not,
you don't keep,
can't choose it all.

271
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.320
There's no choosing.

272
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.670
Any random person can just cut their way into your life.

273
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.350
Just content store right through your fucking life.
Online.
Yeah.

274
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.520
And it's not like a real commute.
I mean,

275
00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:53.430
you can create a community online with a message board or something like that,

276
00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:57.060
but with Twitter lists and shit like that,
like who you follow,
who you block.

277
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.420
But you know,
at the end of the day,
just,
you know,
it's,

278
00:16:00.421 --> 00:16:05.310
this is the boundaries between people are kind of separated and people can just

279
00:16:05.311 --> 00:16:10.260
get at people.
And so youtube comments are a perfect example of that.

280
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.190
You want to see like how the world is going.
You look at the youtube comments.

281
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.050
If the youtube comments were like,

282
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.110
well better luck next time and he seems like a cool guy.

283
00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.630
It wasn't my kind of music,
but I could see how some people get like it.

284
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.670
That's a nice way.
Or each shit drown in a river of AIDS.
You faggot,

285
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.770
cons,
fame.
Yeah.
I mean do you see those over and over again and yeah.

286
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.760
Youtube doesn't block them and it is a fascinating sociological experiment.

287
00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.430
Thousands of years from now,
if data's still exists,

288
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.630
if you can still read off of our hard drives,
probably you won't be able to,

289
00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:46.470
but whoever finds us in our archeological future,

290
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.110
the way we have found ancient Sumeria or ancient Rome or you know,

291
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.850
any civilization that we've tried to piece together from information from the

292
00:16:53.851 --> 00:16:57.150
past,
they're going to look at youtube comments and they're going to be like,

293
00:16:57.151 --> 00:17:01.830
look at these crazy ass holes.
Yeah,
look at these motherfuckers.
Any,

294
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.250
any video that they go to.
What if they went to Rebecca Black?

295
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.510
Here's just a 1314 year old girl talking about and hanging out with their

296
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.800
freedoms and she had a song,
she's 14 years old,
man,

297
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.761
she's a little girl.

298
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:17.970
You're not supposed to like that song if you're a fucking grown person.

299
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But that song was assaulted by a fucking tsunami of Shit.

300
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.700
Yep.

301
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.330
You those comments and you look at like her 25 million hits or whatever the hell

302
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:34.980
she had.
The comments on her videos are horrendous.
They're terrifying.

303
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.770
Just fucking raw anger and all it is is just an easy target.

304
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.790
That's all it is.
It's just an open,
easy target.
What you're supposed to do,

305
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.070
you're not supposed to go,
this is fucking bullshit.

306
00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:50.100
This is what passes for fucking music.
No,

307
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.310
<v 4>that's not what he's supposed to,
we're supposed to do is go,
oh,</v>

308
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.690
this isn't for me because I'm not 14 right.
Not get angry.

309
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.050
Just move on with your life.
But some people,
man,

310
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.750
they just want to get on youtube when your motto,
fuck,

311
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.720
I want you to feel what I feel.
Yeah.

312
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.990
<v 3>Ah,
fucking spa.
They just went up sweaty,</v>

313
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.690
sweaty fingers pecking down on the keys.
God,

314
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.840
I see people like got my message board all the time.

315
00:18:16.841 --> 00:18:19.510
Just get cunty with somebody for no reason.
I'll just,

316
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.950
I'll just send them to the special ed room.
Get Out,
get out.
Stop that.

317
00:18:23.951 --> 00:18:25.360
You don't have to do that for no reason.

318
00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:28.750
You don't have to just shitty with people.
As far as I can recall,

319
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.080
I have never left of West shitty fucking car.

320
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:34.930
I just don't take the time to leave a shitty comment.
So silly.

321
00:18:34.931 --> 00:18:37.150
I mean I left a single aim to,
yeah,

322
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.690
<v 4>I've gotten in a bunch of those.</v>

323
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.580
But what people don't understand about flame wars,

324
00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:45.170
this is kind of like a competition,
you know,
it's sorta like the dozens,
you know,

325
00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:48.080
like you play the dozens,
you know,
if you don't know what it is,
it's like,

326
00:18:48.081 --> 00:18:51.920
you know,
your Mama's so fat.
You know,
once you sit down,

327
00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:54.590
people think she's a sofa,
you know,
and you go back and forth.

328
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.990
He insult each other.
You know what I mean?
Like it's like a big thing.

329
00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:59.300
Like with the brothers,
they love,
they love to play the dozens.

330
00:18:59.301 --> 00:19:02.060
That's what it's called.
But that's sort of like with flame wars are,

331
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.480
it's like it's kind of fun that were all anonymous,
right?

332
00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:07.580
And so you kind of like just up to your wits.

333
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.610
It's just you and your wits against somebody else and their wits.

334
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.630
And all of a sudden you get in some conti little argument with someone online

335
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.790
and you want to fucking rock on,
man.

336
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.060
You would sit back and let me craft my words carefully here.

337
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.510
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
And I love watching it as a sport.

338
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.690
I like watching like smart people like go back and,

339
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.860
and the really conti thing to do is to have a sentence and then respond with a

340
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:31.760
big chunk.

341
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.420
And then another sentence and [inaudible] with a big chunk where it's like

342
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:38.810
you're taking little,
it's such a bully move where you're taking like little,

343
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:39.681
a sentence,

344
00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:43.280
a little tiny segment of what someone said and not in the greater context of

345
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.920
several paragraphs of writing,
but just one little sentence.

346
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.550
And then they'll respond to it with a goat,
a river of shit.
Yep.

347
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.190
And you go back and forth and back and forth.
I've done that.
I've done it.

348
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.400
It's stupid.
I don't do it anymore.
I occasionally I do,

349
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.570
but for the most part I just try to be silly with it.
But in the past,
man,

350
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.930
I've gotten involved in like long flame wars with people that went on for days.

351
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.311
<v 3>Well,</v>

352
00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:08.260
I mean if you think of it like imagine if if youtube had existed when Buddha

353
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:12.700
incarnated on the planet,
so like he could like upload his ideas on to Youtube.

354
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:17.680
It would still have shitty comments.
Like what a fucking joke.
You idiot.

355
00:20:17.681 --> 00:20:20.320
What are you talking about?
Life is suffering.

356
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.880
Go sit under the tree some more faggot.

357
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.930
They will be like that.
When you,
what do you think

358
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.480
<v 4>when you hears that though?</v>

359
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:32.300
I mean don't you have a little bit of an instinct to say the same thing.

360
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.120
Life is suffering.
Oh,
profound one please,

361
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.050
please ponder on when you get your Dick sucked.
Cause that suffering.
No,
no,
no.

362
00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:41.030
It's not.
When you're in an awesome movies.
That's how I got this.

363
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.260
Not when you're on stage,
you're killing is that sounds like.
Let me,
no,

364
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.540
hold on.
When you're hanging out with your,
is it suffering?
No,
it's not.

365
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.510
If you have a nice car and it's comfortable and you get a good stereo and the

366
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:57.370
creed song comes on,
is that suffering?
No.
No.
It's not Buddha.

367
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.870
Buddha's life sucked cause Buddha didn't have cool shit or cool friends.

368
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.823
That's wrong.

369
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.710
<v 3>Yeah.
He had a whole bunch of chipmunks and actually said that's wrong.</v>

370
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.560
No,
that's knows.
Well,
the nose

371
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.840
go way back.
History is very vague,

372
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.290
but my relationship with Buhler secrecy,
is that okay?

373
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.200
<v 1>No,
but the thing when you're saying good,
a shitty life there,</v>

374
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.320
there's the story of Buddha and Buddha's started off as a a very wealthy prince

375
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.290
and there was a problem.
What year?
I have no idea

376
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.880
<v 4>that life sucked.
It doesn't matter what it does.</v>

377
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.510
I don't care if it's according center BC,
six,
seven,

378
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.750
eight d and a Harem.
He had a Harem.
Yeah,
that's good.

379
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:41.050
It's stinky girls with no razors,
a razor insight.

380
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.230
Everybody's disgusted and the time I,

381
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.500
they're all scratching for food and has a pretty good line of heroin.

382
00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:50.770
Get the fuck Outta here.
Listen,
man,
it was a terrible time to live.
Terrible.

383
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.660
No Internet,
no cell phones,
no refrigerator,
no vaccines,

384
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.750
no fucking right US military presence overseas.

385
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.470
Listen as a terrible God damn time to live.
Fuck Buddha ideas.

386
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.860
Ridiculous life is not suffering life.

387
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.470
<v 3>The rest of the noble truths.
Oh well hold on.</v>

388
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.430
You said no bull fight.
Said No.
That's what they're called.
But

389
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.220
she just does the most for type of thing a human can ever say.

390
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:23.450
Do you know the noble truths?
That's what they're called.

391
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.640
I understand that.

392
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.700
<v 4>I'm just fucking around here.
These are just jokes.
Don't get personal.</v>

393
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.900
He takes it very personal.

394
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.950
<v 3>No,
I don't.
I like to shit on boot every now and just to get a ride.
Just off.</v>

395
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.810
You sound like you don't know what it is.

396
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.820
You could pick on Dunkin and he won't even fight back,

397
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.400
but you're talking about Buddha who will fucking kick your ass,
dude.

398
00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:43.220
But it would be like step up and dug and dug and Doug

399
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.360
<v 1>in front of the UFC and being like,
you know,
cause they're fight.</v>

400
00:22:48.361 --> 00:22:52.560
They fight eight rounds and then you'd be like,
well no,
they don't.

401
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.190
<v 3>No.
Would be no rules,
no rules.</v>

402
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.850
<v 1>Where you're like,
it's a clique like you.
Clearly.
If you don't know what it is.</v>

403
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.000
<v 3>Well Dude,
it was all at brown brother,
brother.
I'm telling jokes,
man,
I'm not,</v>

404
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.220
I don't believe any of this shit.
I'm saying,
well,

405
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.770
you're thinking Buddha's a loser who you're hurting.
You got it.
Yeah.

406
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.890
You don't know.
Totally gone against the whole truth of Buddha.

407
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.540
We need to really believe in him.

408
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.530
<v 4>All I'm saying is I wouldn't want to live back then.
I wouldn't either.</v>

409
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.400
I'm not saying the Buddha was wrong when he said life is suffering.

410
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.210
It just sounds a little pretentious and if somebody said it today,

411
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.840
life is suffering,
I would want to probably kick them.
Right.

412
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.910
<v 1>There's three other things after that.
Oh,
okay.
Go ahead.
So this,</v>

413
00:23:37.911 --> 00:23:42.140
the second one is the cause of suffering is attachment to things staying the way

414
00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:45.650
they are.
The idea that things aren't going to change,
so is suffering.

415
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.680
In other words,
you're suffering when you think things don't change.

416
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:49.021
<v 4>Oh.</v>

417
00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:52.560
So what I did is basically the exact same thing that I criticized people doing

418
00:23:52.561 --> 00:23:56.070
on the message boards where they take one line,
don't even read the rest of it.

419
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.960
I didn't even listen to their whole sentence.

420
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.830
I took one one line and I just tack boots and socks.

421
00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:05.160
I don't really mean any of the things I say.
I say thanks for the fun of it.
Okay.

422
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.180
I really do have Buddhas.
I have fucking boot Tattoo on my arm.
Come on man.

423
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.770
I'm fascinated by Buddhists.

424
00:24:10.771 --> 00:24:13.440
That's one of the things I first saw during psychedelic experiences.

425
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.330
The Golden Buddha made of light.
Yeah.
Golden Buddha in the Lotus position.

426
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.050
And then there was like infinite numbers of them around them.

427
00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:25.880
Like fractals of Golden Buddhas in the lowest position.

428
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.650
Oh it was one of the craziest experiences,
right?

429
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.410
<v 1>It's a core religion man.
Cause it's a,
it's,
it's a viral religion,
which is,</v>

430
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.550
it's very different from a lot of other world religions like Christianity and

431
00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:40.540
Islam that kind of come into a place and try to change what's happening in the

432
00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:42.670
place to conform to Christianity.

433
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.940
Buddhism goes into a place and like analyze is whatever the belief system is in

434
00:24:48.761 --> 00:24:52.330
that place,
and then incorporates that into the philosophy of Buddhism.

435
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:56.860
So you get these fastly different forms of Buddhism all over the planet,
like a,

436
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.160
and I like Tibetans.

437
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.390
If you look at Zen Buddhism and then you look at Tibetan Buddhism,

438
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.740
they couldn't be more different.
And Zen Buddhism is,
it's very austere.
Um,

439
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.190
if you look at a zen monastery,
the walls,
I,
I've never been in one,

440
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.990
but the walls are made of rice paper and like to like these guys fucking sitting

441
00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:16.750
there and meditating for like just spinning their whole life meditating.

442
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.550
It's very,
very stark.

443
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.410
Then you look at Tibetan Buddhism and it's like Golden Buddhas and prayer wheels

444
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:28.120
and prayer flags,
and it's like this bright,
beautiful thing.
And the reason is,

445
00:25:28.121 --> 00:25:30.280
is when Buddhism came to,

446
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.660
to bet there was a religion called Bon bon,
that was the original religion,

447
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.350
and it just took that religion and transformed it.

448
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.600
So that embodied the noble truth of Buddhism.
Wow.
Isn't that cool?

449
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.930
Just hybrid the hybrid.
Yeah.
That's what it does.
It,
it,
it infects,
uh,

450
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.370
infects probably the wrong word,

451
00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:52.660
but it gets into a culture and then just the culture.
Sex is a great word.
Yeah,

452
00:25:52.661 --> 00:25:56.020
that's what I mean.
It's,
it's sort of a negative word.
Yeah.
Well,

453
00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:57.970
I mean that is what it is.
It kind of,
it's viral.

454
00:25:57.971 --> 00:26:02.670
It like gets into the DNA of a thing and then transforms it into,
uh,

455
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.950
Buddhism.
That's fascinating.
Fascinating.
It really is.

456
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.160
<v 4>You know,
it,
I've always wondered like what the boundaries of Meditation Army,</v>

457
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:14.550
cause I don't really have the time to be sitting around all day meditating,

458
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.730
but I always feel like anything like even the isolation tank,

459
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:23.880
which is very much like a,
um,
a symptom or a rather a,
a,
um,

460
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.860
a method of meditation,
the isolation tank you,
the more you do it,

461
00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:32.510
the better you get at it,
right?
The more relaxed you get when you're,

462
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:35.670
you're inside,
the easier it is for you to let go,

463
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.970
the easier it is for you to get to that really crazy deep state.

464
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.520
So I would assume that with meditation,

465
00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:44.010
just like with anything with music or arts,
the

466
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 5>more time you spend at at the better you get at,
I would wonder what,</v>

467
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.720
what the fuck can you do with your brain if you have like 10,
12 hours a day.

468
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.390
Cause you know,
Eddie Bravo has this friend of his,

469
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.080
he went to Egypt with this lady and uh,
she um,
was uh,

470
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.800
a Kundalini efficient auto,

471
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.950
like a serious divo tay of Kundalini Yoga and this lady did Kundalini Yoga all

472
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.040
fucking day.

473
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.370
And what she said was that it was all about stimulating particular areas of your

474
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:20.031
brain that can produce psychedelic chemicals and that what you're trying to do

475
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:25.071
is like open up your shockers and you can tune it into higher frequencies of

476
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:29.760
consciousness.
And that these people say that at the highest levels that these,

477
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.710
these people are capable of putting themselves into a psychedelic state.

478
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.030
Absolutely.
Naturally.

479
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.960
So like what you would have to do by taking mushrooms are taken payoti or

480
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:40.410
whatever.

481
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.580
They can just meditate and get there and they travel in their mind to like

482
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:46.470
distinct,
different places.

483
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.330
And the idea is that what they're doing is they're literally changing the form

484
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.420
of their mind.
If you look at the mind of a,

485
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.270
a person who meditates,
you know,
a Buddhist monk,
you know,

486
00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:00.810
he person who meditates 10 12 hours a day,
their,

487
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.780
the way their brain works is different.

488
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.880
The size of different areas of the brain is different.
The,
the,

489
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.820
when they look at the activity in the mind,

490
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.690
it's different than a regular person's brain.
Yeah,
I've seen that stuff.

491
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.320
Fascinating.
So you mean they,
what?
Tuning into higher,

492
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.320
like a higher plane of consciousness,

493
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:24.150
if that is what they're doing that they're able to do.
Just like,

494
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.960
I mean,
what we see in marathon running,
just like what we see in everything,

495
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:30.840
you know,
like who could you run a marathon?
I couldn't run a fucking marathon.

496
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.630
Could you imagine if you got to run a marathon right now against one of those

497
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:37.680
skinny guys from Africa that runs barefoot fucked.
You're fucked.

498
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:39.810
You're never going to run as fast as he never going to catch.

499
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:43.080
I'm never gonna be able to run 26 miles as fast as him,
but he can do it.

500
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:45.000
And you know what that means?
You could probably do it too,

501
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.380
but it doesn't start like that.

502
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.280
It starts with you run one mile and then you learn to run five miles and you

503
00:28:50.281 --> 00:28:53.130
build yourself up.
So you can run 26 miles barefoot.

504
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.890
But most people can't just do,
do that right from the jump.

505
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.290
That's gotta be the same way with meditation.

506
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.880
Because I know that when I meditate,

507
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.600
I can get into a really good state just when I'm alone,

508
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:07.440
I'm alone in a hotel room.
I'll do like yoga and I'll do,
and then I'll meditate.

509
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:11.850
I'll go into a certain pattern of breathing and our focus and concentrate on my

510
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:16.250
breath.
And when I do that,
I can achieve a good perspective.
I can achieve like a,

511
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:20.100
a good objective look at at life and I can,

512
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:23.340
I can relieve myself of,
uh,
you know,

513
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:26.970
any unnecessary concerns and,
you know,
and I,
and like I,

514
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.770
I'm pretty good at that.

515
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.180
But I would imagine then if you really devote yourself to really just

516
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:36.240
concentrating on achieving like the,
the,

517
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.770
the possibilities of this different states of consciousness.

518
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.160
We linked to I think

519
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.840
<v 1>to,
you'd be able to get high.
I did this thing,
uh,
because I,
I I studied,
uh,</v>

520
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.020
I had to do this.
Uh,
um,
uh,
I studied uh,

521
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.730
religion and psychology in school.
So,
um,

522
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.740
I got to do an internship.

523
00:29:56.741 --> 00:30:00.350
It is in temple and part of the internship is you do this thing called a saw

524
00:30:00.351 --> 00:30:03.730
sheen,
which is where you sit for like three days straight.

525
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.370
It's just staring at this wall for three days straight and the Lotus position

526
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:12.340
and this,
and then you do,
well,
I went to do it and I,
I made it through,

527
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.660
<v 6>okay.</v>

528
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.530
<v 1>I think like 11 hours of Matt and I made it through you sleep like four hours</v>

529
00:30:18.531 --> 00:30:22.210
and then the next day you wake up and immediate you eat and then you go right

530
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:25.000
back into meditating.
And so I made it,
I don't know,

531
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:28.300
I made it a pathetically small length of time because it was snowing outside.

532
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.950
And I started thinking about how good a beer with

533
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.320
<v 3>sounding</v>

534
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.390
<v 1>no man,
I ain't man,
I love to drink a beer.
But like,
um,</v>

535
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.730
but during the time that I was staring at the wall,
I don't know,

536
00:30:40.731 --> 00:30:43.310
like six hours in or at some certain amount of time in,

537
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.770
they start doing this thing called the heart sutra.

538
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.100
They start chanting this thing called the Hartsutra.
Uh,
and it go,

539
00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:51.920
and I don't remember the exact way it goes,
but it's something like no mine,

540
00:30:51.921 --> 00:30:56.630
no body,
no life,
no death,
no beginning,
no.
It's very psychedelic.
It's very droney.

541
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.160
And it's a negation of everything.

542
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.660
<v 3>No mine,
no.
But things.
Say it again.</v>

543
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.270
<v 1>I,
it's,
this is not an exact rendition,
but as I recall,
it's like no my,</v>

544
00:31:05.271 --> 00:31:09.120
no body,
no life,
no death,
no beginning.
No.
It's,

545
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.680
<v 3>and they say this altogether.
Uh,
yeah,
they all start chanting.
It must be dope.</v>

546
00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.300
It's dope.
And you've been staring at a wall.
I don't know though.

547
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:22.100
You look at the body,
no mind.
No,
but not exactly a light show.
Death.

548
00:31:22.101 --> 00:31:23.510
Let's just try that.
No.
Yeah,

549
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.950
<v 7>no.
My,
no body,
no live,
no dad.
No,</v>

550
00:31:27.951 --> 00:31:31.050
my no body,
no live,
no death.

551
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.380
<v 3>No.
Yeah.
I imagine that</v>

552
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.020
there's some weird about that,
man.
What is weird about that play?

553
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.240
Look up the heart sutra on youtube and play it right.

554
00:31:41.241 --> 00:31:43.880
There's some things are still were stoned as fuck,
but listen.

555
00:31:43.881 --> 00:31:46.730
But what is weird about like chance man,
let's do it.
I ready.

556
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.430
<v 7>No.
My no body,
no live,
no death.
No My,</v>

557
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:53.950
no body,
no live,
no death.

558
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.940
<v 3>There's something weird about that,
dude.
There's something xone.</v>

559
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.090
There's something hypnotic about any stupid chant.

560
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.100
Even that you want to hear something super tripping you.

561
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.710
I think you could play it legally.
It's a cause.
It's a,
it's a chant.

562
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.530
You look up the Lotus suture on youtube.
Lotus Sutra,
the Lotus Sutra.

563
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.780
Listen to this one.
This one's so fucking trippy.
Yeah.
I mean what,

564
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:14.551
what would they're trying to do?

565
00:32:14.551 --> 00:32:17.180
They're trying to put themselves into a state of consciousness by,

566
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.880
by humming lit like that.
Yeah.
It's got be the one I'm looking for it that

567
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.400
<v 1>I'll show you the Warren.
Brian,
hold on.
Oh yeah.
That one at the very top,</v>

568
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:27.160
but loaded suture play.
The first one with a blue flower right there.

569
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.830
Listen to this.
I love with dance and I'm high.

570
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.600
<v 8>Okay.
Okay.</v>

571
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.830
[inaudible]

572
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.530
<v 2>that was the 16 hundreds version of Pete boxing.</v>

573
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.540
Crazy bad ass.
I'm scared that if they keep going,

574
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:10.010
candy man's going to come out of the screen.

575
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.640
<v 8>I
get it.</v>

576
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.080
<v 3>Yeah.
It's cool man.
It's really trippy how odd.</v>

577
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.960
It's almost like country music don't lead on with digital,

578
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.470
but if you listened to some of the,
like she,
she had,

579
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:32.470
he say it should bobo that the IOWASCA ceremonies.

580
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.500
If you listen to the chanting of the people in the Amazon,

581
00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:35.850
it sounds very similar to that.

582
00:33:35.851 --> 00:33:39.900
It's the same kind of like droney thing that has within it that feeling of like

583
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.700
a twinkie.
Weird like I dunno,
like something from New Orleans.
There's,

584
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.290
it's bluesy almost

585
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.920
<v 2>very strange and how many different people are doing that?</v>

586
00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:53.380
You think it's not one person,
right?

587
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.690
That is a group of people for sure.
Congregation.

588
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.490
We're doing that.
I was a solid routine.
Did everybody have the same job?

589
00:34:03.491 --> 00:34:04.240
That's what I'm saying.

590
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.230
But they all saying the same thing or whether people do people do different

591
00:34:08.231 --> 00:34:10.330
harmonies and stuff when you do that champ?
Yeah,

592
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:13.870
that's what I'm thinking because it doesn't sound like you could like,
you know,

593
00:34:13.871 --> 00:34:15.050
I don't know.
I mean maybe it could.

594
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:18.610
I mean sure you could like think of what the noises that Michael Winslow guy

595
00:34:18.611 --> 00:34:21.970
makes.
I mean you probably could do it but it doesn't seem like,

596
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.820
that seems like a couple of different things are being said at the same time.

597
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:25.683
Is that right?

598
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.210
<v 3>Oh yeah.
No,
no.
It's one suture.
It's,
they're reading a scripture.</v>

599
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:32.150
They're reading this thing called the Lotus Sutra,
which is this whole weird.

600
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:36.350
So they're all saying the same thing.
They're all making the same noises.
Yeah,

601
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:37.760
I think so,
man.
I did.

602
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.760
It does seem like there's something under the the opera girl sounding girl.
Yeah,

603
00:34:41.761 --> 00:34:42.594
there was an option

604
00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:43.870
<v 2>girl to me.</v>

605
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.890
Well maybe we should play it again cause it seemed to me that it was like a

606
00:34:47.891 --> 00:34:49.780
couple different sounds.

607
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.020
Now they're saying the same thing.
You're saying it really fast.

608
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.250
It's a hum to it.

609
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:16.460
That makes you think might be something going on in the background,
but it's not.

610
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.640
They're hitting every now and then.
There's like a little intersection.

611
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.750
It's a harmony.
Every now and then though,
someone will break.
Right.

612
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.803
<v 8>Cool.</v>

613
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.360
<v 2>Oh yeah.
They're starting at different times.
They're saying the same shit,</v>

614
00:35:31.361 --> 00:35:34.440
but I felt like Mellison.
Yeah,
they're trying to catch up.
Yeah.

615
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:40.690
<v 9>Wow.
This is,
if you listen to this while Shermin thinking about trip,
I think</v>

616
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.430
I would get all the knowledge in the universe.

617
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.470
I think that would make just shit go crazy.

618
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.950
Run over you like a river of diamond and crusted fish.

619
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.120
You wouldn't be able to catch it though.
It's so much knowledge,

620
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:58.270
but you wouldn't be able to grasp it.
Yeah.
It could be.
Could conflict your

621
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:03.190
<v 1>trip up because that's where nam-myoho-renge-kyo comes from.
That's the Nami.</v>

622
00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.880
[inaudible] comes from the Lotus Sutra,
so when you hear the beginning of it,

623
00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:11.500
it's meal.
[inaudible] he says Andreessen my hundred Nikki.
Gosh.
Wow.

624
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.930
How did you ever memorize all that shit?

625
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.590
Why had the chance to strangulation

626
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.180
again,
eight months and I don't even have,
I don't have the whole thing memorized.

627
00:36:25.181 --> 00:36:26.620
I just have the different,

628
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.140
but you have some parts I have up until there's like tea,

629
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.650
there's two different prayers you do.
And I have the first one.

630
00:36:32.651 --> 00:36:35.680
I can almost do that completely without the book.
And then the second one,

631
00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:39.070
I have to do the book.
If I'm,
they have,
there's like a button.

632
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.050
How does all this get started?

633
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.580
What I mean you look at like how bizarre all that is and was psychedelic that

634
00:36:45.581 --> 00:36:48.610
religion is,
how the hell do I get started?
What's the,
what's the history?

635
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.690
That's the fucking question man.
I mean,
you've got this,
this uh,
the uh,

636
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.070
Buddha who according to the story,
um,

637
00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.820
wanted to be an aesthetic like when it will live with this live with is a Buddha

638
00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:05.710
lived live with the king and the king.
There was a prophecy.

639
00:37:05.711 --> 00:37:08.770
He's either going to be a great conquer her or this is a real human being.

640
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:13.660
Absolutely proven by history.
Ah,
man,
I think so.
I mean sure.

641
00:37:13.661 --> 00:37:17.380
More provable than Jesus or I couldn't answer that.
I have no idea.
I mean,

642
00:37:17.381 --> 00:37:18.580
it did to me.
It's like I,

643
00:37:18.581 --> 00:37:23.581
it's not that much of a consideration because there's so many scriptures that

644
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:25.810
come from it.
There's clearly something there.

645
00:37:25.811 --> 00:37:28.660
And it's like there are a bunch of interpretations,
I don't know.

646
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.560
But the story is called,
it's still,
it's not like it's in Buddhism,

647
00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.070
it's different from Christianity.
Christianity,
some forms of Christianity.

648
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:36.850
They're like,

649
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:41.290
you must believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God.

650
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.880
They have to believe that for the magic toward Buddhism isn't quite like that.

651
00:37:45.881 --> 00:37:50.590
Buddhism is more like test all of this.
Like test it.

652
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.450
Like you would be if you were buying gold,

653
00:37:52.451 --> 00:37:54.340
like you would weigh and measure and test gold.

654
00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:59.080
Cause you need to logically understand what this is it that you have to

655
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.500
logically,
it has to logically make sense to you.
And this is the Buddhism.

656
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.780
This is,
that's not all forms of it isn't,
but sounds like,
ah,
there's a great,

657
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.100
so you were,
you were telling me,

658
00:38:09.101 --> 00:38:12.550
I'm sorry I interrupted you before and you were explaining that he lived with

659
00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:17.530
the king.
Yeah.
He was the prince and the king didn't want him to,
uh,
cause the,

660
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.690
the uh,
the Prophet said he'll either be the war Tawfiq God of the wheel Turner,

661
00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:27.520
like this great prophet that he was,
or he's going to be this conquer,
like it.

662
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.230
He's going to be like a world conquer.
And so his father was like,
Oh fuck that.

663
00:38:32.231 --> 00:38:35.380
I don't want him to be a fucking profit.
I want him to be a world conqueror.

664
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:39.430
So I'm going to keep him locked up on the grounds that palace and give him

665
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.790
everything he wants.
You know,
a Harem,
whatever he wants,
he can have.

666
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.770
And so the story is he a,
I was out with his,

667
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:51.110
like,
I dunno,
he was out riding around.
He saw three sites and I,

668
00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.430
I don't remember exactly what they were,
but I know one was a dying man.

669
00:38:55.330 --> 00:39:00.190
One was one,
one was Artcorps.
He saw corpse and I diseased man and an aesthetic.

670
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:04.390
He saw these three things and he's like,
oh,
there's,
I'm more there.

671
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.100
All this pleasure that I'm getting in.
The pal is,
is temporary.
It's temporary.

672
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:11.800
It's not gonna.
Last,
I'm going to get old,
I'm going to die,

673
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.470
I'm going to get disease.
These are the,
the,
this happens to everyone.

674
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:17.620
There's no escape from this happens to everyone.
So I would,

675
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.820
so these pleasures I'm experiencing,
I would rather,
um,

676
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.840
figure out a way to have lasting permanent,
uh,

677
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.170
realization then this temporary transient shit.

678
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:32.620
So he went and became an aesthetic and he,
uh,
uh,

679
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.920
he like a starved himself to the point of death almost.
Cause he was like,

680
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.920
he was like,
did everything to the extreme.

681
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.560
So there's like statues of like starving Buddha.
Yeah,
I've seen those.
Yeah.
You,

682
00:39:43.561 --> 00:39:45.100
you,
you told me about that.
Yeah.

683
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.430
Because you know that I have this thing about collecting Buddhist statues and

684
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.340
I've got a couple of Thai Buddhas and shit.
And then you,
you told me about this.

685
00:39:52.341 --> 00:39:53.530
Yeah.
Starving Buddha.
I was like,

686
00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:55.180
what are you talking about that you sent me a picture,
dude,

687
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:58.930
I almost thought it was a joke,
no tight on his face.
And he's like,

688
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.980
he's not eating anything because he's trying to go the route of the aesthetic
to,

689
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:06.070
um,
to,
uh,
so that he could,
uh,
you know,

690
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.670
have realization and Brian put one of those pictures up,
man.

691
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.660
It's fucking cool of those starving Buddha cause they're creepy as fuck man.

692
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.010
I never had heard about this before.
Oh,
it's cool man.

693
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:21.660
It's how long did he do this in his life?
I don't know the time that he's ever,

694
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.910
and everyone has a story or the goals of this story.
Yeah,
this is it.
This is,

695
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:29.800
it all starts with this store.
And so then he,
um,
so that didn't work out.

696
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:34.450
So,
and then he,
he uh,
he ate and uh,
you know,

697
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:35.980
the aesthetics rejected him.

698
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:41.190
The aesthetics rejected him because he was eating and that this man who was head

699
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.630
shit.
Yeah,
he was,
he got really close to death that way.

700
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.400
I think there's a phone,

701
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.080
<v 2>body one,
Brian,
if you back up,</v>

702
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.920
there's some other ones that have like full body.
Well,
either way you see,

703
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.460
you get to get the picture.
That's creepy.

704
00:40:56.461 --> 00:40:58.080
Who the fuck would want to keep that in their house.

705
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.100
If you go over a chick's house and she's got that starving Buddha in her house,

706
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.490
fucking run,
Bro,
but run.

707
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.650
Why would you want to look at that all day?

708
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.460
<v 1>I wouldn't leave.
See the veins in his ribs.
It's creepy.</v>

709
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.920
<v 2>Yeah.
You don't want to look at it.
That's barely.
That's like a cartoon.</v>

710
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.590
<v 1>It's like he's getting mashed potatoes and it's an old training.</v>

711
00:41:18.591 --> 00:41:20.950
It's like he's about to eat a bowl of mashed potato.
It's calm.

712
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.800
He's an old tranny.

713
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.730
Starvings tranny giant bowl.
Come.

714
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.650
<v 2>Um,
speaking of calm.</v>

715
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.690
Hang on.
Was Fun.
Huh?
Have a good time.

716
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:39.280
<v 10>Speaking of was England was fun.
What happened?
Well,
no ego.
I'll tell you this.</v>

717
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.840
Oh No,
you came on Joe.

718
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:45.070
<v 2>Not really.
I mean,
he sorta did.
Well,
Joe's fast.</v>

719
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.770
That's like good.
We went,
we went to a,
a strip club for 10 minutes at a time.

720
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.520
10 minutes.

721
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.010
It was right next to this restaurant with this bomb ass Indian restaurant in

722
00:41:57.011 --> 00:42:01.870
Birmingham,
and then we would stop in at this place.
So disaster.

723
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.830
<v 10>Well that's Joe Rogan.</v>

724
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.040
<v 2>It wasn't that.
It's just,
oh no,
there were people coming up here,</v>

725
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.650
take your picture.
But it was just so,
it wasn't weird a strip club ever.

726
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.700
And I'm trying to be as nice as possible.
The best way to say it is,

727
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.340
you'd be kind of shocked that those girls are strippers.

728
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.160
Wondering why you're going to say,
you know,

729
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.490
<v 10>well it seems like there were other vocations that would have been better</v>

730
00:42:24.491 --> 00:42:25.324
choices for them.

731
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.790
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
It seems like I'm,</v>

732
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.180
when they're guiding me are always telling them what to do.

733
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.950
You shouldn't have said stripper anyway.
Nice,
nice people.
But was,
we couldn't,

734
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.150
we couldn't do it.

735
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:37.220
We got in there and we just thought we were going to be able to sit down and

736
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.640
just have a beer and just laugh and Giggle,
you know,

737
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.430
for a little bit and then leave.
But we're getting bombed on.

738
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.710
<v 10>Yeah.
It was pretty sad.
I mean,
it wasn't even like when I go to strip clubs,</v>

739
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.850
aside from like the fact of like seeing hot naked girls dancing.

740
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.730
The other thing I like is the,
uh,
the eat the darkness.
Yeah.

741
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.120
Seediness and the darkness because it's funny to me cause it's all AI.

742
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.130
This is a cultural,
this is a result of a specific type of culture.
It's a,

743
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:10.760
it's an like this wouldn't work if people weren't sexually repressed.

744
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:12.500
This wouldn't work if people didn't wear clothes.

745
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:16.490
There's like so many weird cultural things that have to happen for a strip club

746
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.430
to even make sense.
So when you go into there and you see like,

747
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.650
you see the fucking weird relationship between the women who are trying to act

748
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.160
dirty and slutty and then the guys who are kind of like feel like they're

749
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.010
breaking the rules tonight.
You know what I mean?

750
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.400
It's a funny thing because it's like,
it really is nothing.

751
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.120
It's like you're looking at a naked girl mounting a fucking pole.

752
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.040
You're getting a lap dance.
It's just,

753
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.820
<v 2>I went to a strip club once,
a Phil Hartman,
Phil Hartman was,
uh,</v>

754
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.400
I was,
uh,
more people.

755
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:53.460
Got to see what that dude was like without being like Mr like clean family,

756
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.490
you know,
he was like,
he was like super concerned about his image.
Right.

757
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:04.480
But outside of that,
he would say like ridiculously dirty shit,
man.

758
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:08.050
He was always telling you the smell his fingers and say it was claiming it was

759
00:44:08.051 --> 00:44:11.570
different people in the Cassady fingers.
Go ahead.
It's fine.
I mean it was like,

760
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.780
it was ridiculous.
He was really funny.

761
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:16.630
I mean to the point where they would get mad at him,
you know,
and he,

762
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.870
he cracked me up,
man.
He would,
he would,
he was a serious blazer.

763
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.390
Feel hard when used to get high every day.
Dude,

764
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.210
especially after work and like he was very professional.

765
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.440
But after work he would get biolase dude get blazed and go out on his boat.

766
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.410
Then I went to a strip club with him once.

767
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.960
<v 5>I've never seen a guy who was,</v>

768
00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:38.700
because he was such a great guy who was so expressive and he was a genuinely

769
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.220
like friendly guy and this is a different era.
Okay.

770
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:45.210
We're talking about the early 1990s.
It was like 1995,
you know,

771
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.870
and it was like,
you know,

772
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:52.050
he was there and the girl was dancing in front of him and he was like,

773
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.660
like there was no shame in it at all.
He was so happy cause he was,

774
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.330
he was so happy and he was looking at her.
She goes,
hey,
just from,

775
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:03.030
I'll never forget his face,
look at and go,
Oh yeah,
that's beautiful.

776
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.990
That's beautiful.
Cool.
He was like smiling like pure and hopeful,

777
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:09.620
like you're beautiful.
Woo.
Like he was just happy.

778
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.340
<v 3>It wasn't creepy.
Now that's great.</v>

779
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:17.530
That's a girl's vagina and ask,
wow man,
I look,
I have fuck,

780
00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:21.360
it's beautiful.
I love people like that.
I love that man.

781
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.260
<v 5>That guy,
when he died,
that hurt,
that sucked.
That was a tough one.
He was a,</v>

782
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.290
he was a really good guy,
man.
That was a tough one.

783
00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.190
Did I ever tell you how I found out there was a girl who,
uh,

784
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.020
I think she works for like one of those,

785
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.880
one of those tabloid shows we had went on one date.
But just,
you know,

786
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:43.160
for whatever reason,
it just didn't click.

787
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:48.430
So I was at home and it was like eight o'clock in the morning and the phone

788
00:45:49.611 --> 00:45:51.950
rings and it's her and I'm like,
what's going on going?

789
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.380
Why are you calling me at eight o'clock in the morning?
And she's like,

790
00:45:54.381 --> 00:45:57.170
you don't know.
And I go,
I don't know what.
And she goes,

791
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.130
I don't want to be the first one to tell you.
I go,

792
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:03.440
well fucking tell me what happened.
And then she goes,
fills dead.
And I go,

793
00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:07.850
Phil Hartman.
And she goes,
yes.
She goes,
it was a murder suicide I want.

794
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.900
Whoa.
And first of all,
I thought he killed her and then killed himself.

795
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:16.070
He thought that first.
Yeah.
I mean,
I mean you hear murder,
suicide.

796
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.790
You just automatically think men are the ones who commit violent crimes.

797
00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.200
That's how I am automatically.

798
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.730
<v 3>Sure.
I don't think that ain't crazy.
Bitches are crazy.</v>

799
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:26.700
And they would fucking shoot.
I always think I'm going to get shot by a girl.

800
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:31.200
I'm dating pool that you're drawing from side.
Good insight.

801
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.910
Yeah.
The dating cool that you draw from has been peed in?

802
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.610
Yes.
Assume,
I mean don't you?

803
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.450
<v 5>When you hear about a murder suicide,
you assumed that it was the man.</v>

804
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.600
<v 3>I actually think around else.
I actually really,
wow,
man,</v>

805
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.680
you're so nice and you're not violent at all.

806
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:54.680
Hang out with crazy guys and like,

807
00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:57.950
I bet because you hang out with fighters and a bunch of Jujitsu guys,

808
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:59.870
you're around at different kind of animal than I'm used to.

809
00:46:59.871 --> 00:47:04.630
I'm just stare like guys,
stop cards and stuff.
Jujitsu guys are,

810
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.020
they're very

811
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.800
<v 5>friendly man.
You'd be amazed.
First of all,
they,</v>

812
00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:12.810
their ego gets squashed real early cause you get tapped out a lot when you learn

813
00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:14.530
Jiu Jitsu,
especially in the early years,

814
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.400
you have to have a healthy ego or you'll never get through.
Being a white belt,

815
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.990
being a white belt is demeaning men.
Manhandle you,
you know,
it's,

816
00:47:22.991 --> 00:47:26.980
I remember my first time I was trained at Carlson Gracie's on Hawthorne Street

817
00:47:26.981 --> 00:47:30.370
is 1996 when I first started doing Jujitsu and there was this kid who was a

818
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:34.790
purple belt.
It's Brazilian kid.
He fucking over me,

819
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.110
just crushed me every time we roll.

820
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:41.980
And it drove me nuts because he wasn't any bigger than me.
He was my size,

821
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:43.090
he was my age,

822
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.240
we were the same and he would just fucking manhandle me did dude would just toss

823
00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:52.390
me around and strangle me.
And I remember thinking like,
man,

824
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:55.990
I can't believe that it's so easy for someone to do this to me.

825
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.180
And then I knew like this guy was only a purple belt.

826
00:47:58.181 --> 00:48:01.030
It wasn't even a black belt.
I'm like,
fuck.

827
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.130
Like that feeling is not a good feeling.

828
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.180
The feeling of getting your ass kicked like that and Jim is not a good feeling.

829
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.050
But the only way to get good is you got to get used to that.
You gotta,

830
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.930
you gotta roll with good guys.
If you don't roll with good guys,

831
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.260
you don't know whether or not you can really tap them.

832
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.810
You don't know whether or not you should only works on people who suck.

833
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.780
You gotta get tapped to tell you again,
you got to get in the beginning,

834
00:48:22.781 --> 00:48:25.550
you got to get strangled all the time.
People got throw you around,

835
00:48:25.551 --> 00:48:27.610
they're going to dominate you.
So if you can get through that,

836
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.400
usually your ego is a really a check.

837
00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.650
Did you Jitsu guys are some of the friendliest,
nicest,

838
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.940
most easy going guys that I've ever been around.

839
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.070
Kickboxers are a little more edgy and one of the reasons is kickboxers they

840
00:48:38.071 --> 00:48:41.890
don't go full out in the gym.
They sorted go,
they go hard.

841
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:43.810
But there's always like,
you're going too hard.

842
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.830
Like this is a thing that happens in standup gems.
It doesn't happen as much.

843
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.110
Happens occasionally but not as much in Jujitsu.

844
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.370
And that's someone going to hard because in standup it's always an issue because

845
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:57.130
you're not really fighting.
You have big gloves on.

846
00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:00.670
The gloves are 16 ounces as opposed to four and when you're,
or you know,

847
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.420
eight or 10 if you kickboxing.
But when,
when you're throwing at each other,

848
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:07.060
you're supposed to be pulling back a little,
you know?

849
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.370
And so guys are always like,
yeah,

850
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:11.440
if I didn't pull back and go to fucking knock your ass out,

851
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:15.190
there's some unresolved issues with some guy.
So they,

852
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:20.070
some of them tend to be a bit more douchey.
It's like the,
and then the,
the,
the,

853
00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:24.840
the more like limited their sport is,
the more insecure they are and the more do,

854
00:49:24.841 --> 00:49:28.150
should they like boxers or more douchey then kickboxers are more douchey.

855
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:31.180
And this is all generalizations,
but,
but for the most part,

856
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.000
Jujitsu guys and wrestlers seem to be like the most easy going.

857
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.950
They go at it all the time.
You know,
you,
you,
you,

858
00:49:37.951 --> 00:49:41.890
you blow out all the stress out of your system and all that,
you know,

859
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.530
all that ego shit.
Especially what you just said,
you just getting,

860
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.600
you get tapped all the time.
You got to accept it.
Yeah.

861
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:47.181
<v 1>Yeah man,</v>

862
00:49:47.181 --> 00:49:51.120
it's spooky when you run into people who have a shitload of pinup aggression.

863
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.310
Yes.
How's that?
Eric?
The Grove and I had parked,

864
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:58.250
wasn't the greatest parking job ever.
I'll admit it was a shitty parking job.

865
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.810
And I'm getting in my car and this old man is standing there looking at me.

866
00:50:02.811 --> 00:50:05.360
He's like,
why did you park like that?

867
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.500
And so it's forcing this weird confrontation in a parking lot.

868
00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:10.610
And I and the guys,

869
00:50:10.611 --> 00:50:13.520
you know that thing when you get around someone and like you can feel your like

870
00:50:13.521 --> 00:50:16.180
goosebumps that happen.
Like they're thinking about hitting you or something.

871
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:20.090
Yeah.
Like your body's telling you like this is not a good situation that was

872
00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:22.310
happening and it's like this old man,
I'm like,
fuck,

873
00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:26.450
this could be that thing where the guy's got a gun and he just,

874
00:50:26.451 --> 00:50:28.010
this is where pops,
this is where

875
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.330
<v 3>the volcano explodes.
And I ended up getting blasted in the grove</v>

876
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:38.600
and they catch it in the background of Mario Lopez's each show.
Yeah.

877
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:43.910
So he's got a show going on somebody and some old man shoots here.

878
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.210
That's the worst people fucking that all the time.

879
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:50.720
People get smoked all the time by people who are like have these little volcanic

880
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:55.260
explosion place at the wrong time.
It's a real,
it's a real scenario.
I uh,

881
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.120
the other day I was driving and there was a biker in the road and he was like

882
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:01.160
doing one of those things where he was like wobbling.
Like,

883
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.890
I think the guy was drunk or something like,

884
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:07.360
and I just like kind of tried to go around them and then I just,
I did a,

885
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.220
I didn't do the horn the whole way.
I did like a,
you know,

886
00:51:10.221 --> 00:51:13.430
like when you just barely touch it and it makes a noise,
you know,

887
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.700
not even allowed at all and he's just like,
starts screaming.

888
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.800
And you know what?
I never saw that boulder,
boulder,
Colorado.

889
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:26.480
You know why 100,000 people?
That's why that's how you're supposed to live.

890
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:28.980
You're not supposed to live like this,
but man,

891
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:34.220
there's some aggro bikers in La.
Man,
I saw,
I saw it.
Remember that guy?

892
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:37.160
Just many fucking people in la.
You're,
you're crazy.

893
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:40.040
You're taking a huge risk if you're riding a bike places.
I mean,

894
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:43.790
I've seen her right to do it and I'm cautious of bikes.
I try to be cautious,

895
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:47.480
but wow.
I look at them.
I'm like,
what a crazy risk you're taking,
dude.

896
00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:52.080
I've seen so many hipster bike accidents in silver lake.
Oh,

897
00:51:52.081 --> 00:51:55.060
we were walking down the sidewalk and you see a,
you know,

898
00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:58.140
hers did have a record store.

899
00:51:58.141 --> 00:52:03.141
They were at dance like they were biking one hand and a couple of books and then

900
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:06.470
you come up to like a fucking hipster having a seizure.

901
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:11.470
I've seen a hipster on the sidewalk seizing up is the ambulance came out library

902
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:18.110
books and Oh my God,
weird like lace crash,

903
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.540
no helmet on,
no helmet,
no helmet crashes and just,

904
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.510
but I saw,

905
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:28.511
I saw a fucking minivan just pull into a parking lot and wasn't paying attention

906
00:52:28.801 --> 00:52:31.720
and just t bone,
a biker.
Oh my 12th.

907
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:36.200
Just fucking dangerous.
So I understand why bikers here freaking out.

908
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:38.990
But do you remember that guy?
The comedy store?
There was a biker.

909
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.700
They used to ride up and down sunset and he was this super aggro biker fucking

910
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:48.040
ripped.
And I saw a guy yell at him and his car.
Like what you did a comic?
No.

911
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.500
So just some bicycler used to hang out.
It's always there,
always there.

912
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.220
And he was always pissed and he's always screaming at traffic and I remember

913
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:58.880
like some car was like watch out cause he's just weaving in and out of traffic

914
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.900
and the guide is stops his bike because I don't think people realize that with

915
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:06.230
bikers were just so you still in cars,
there's this like I can get away from you.

916
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:10.610
I can say something a bicycler can weave through traffic at a stop light and

917
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:12.410
just attack you like they can get you.

918
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:14.690
We forget that there's no enclosure around them.

919
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.960
We forget that people have like gotten used to like to delay and violence

920
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.860
between cars where you're like,
well fuck you.
It's too much work.

921
00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:26.140
I don't get out of the car and fucking get all the way to

922
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.983
<v 2>you.</v>

923
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.070
<v 10>These guys an open fucking air and he's like weaving in and out of sunset</v>

924
00:53:31.071 --> 00:53:35.390
boulevard traffic and he's deranged and so some idiot says something to him and

925
00:53:35.391 --> 00:53:37.730
the guy,
this is what he's been waiting to happen.

926
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:42.910
He like stops his bike turns and looks at the guy and not this,

927
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.390
you could just hear he meant this.
He's like,

928
00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.150
I'm going to put you in the hospital,

929
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:50.840
I'm going to break your fucking jaw is what he said.

930
00:53:50.841 --> 00:53:55.820
And it was just such venom and evil and anger spewing out of this.
He didn't,

931
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:57.070
he didn't people.

932
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.580
<v 2>Yeah.
You can't be a cut.</v>

933
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.770
There's people that want to punch people if you've run into and your cut.
Yeah.

934
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.910
But I mean,
isn't it interesting that we have this sort of uh,
uh,

935
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:10.070
escalated anger that exists in inside cars because we don't have to socially

936
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:14.010
interact with each other.
We don't have to like feel it.
Yeah.
You know,

937
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.130
we are going to have to feel the repercussions of social repercussions of being

938
00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:20.250
a shithead so people just get so elevated and cars

939
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.560
<v 10>pot when you see it,
like SUV is,</v>

940
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.450
I don't think I could ever go back down to like a small little car cause he feel

941
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.350
more protected in an Sua cause this shit goes down.

942
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.220
You just run the person over and go over and you know,

943
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.680
a couple of cars and escape

944
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.380
<v 2>knew who watched too many movies.
How did you get a flat?</v>

945
00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.950
The fuck are you talking about?
Yeah,
it's weird how you just assume.

946
00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.010
But it's funny also the things that people say when they're in cars.

947
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:46.990
There's a video of a Nick Diaz and he had missed a press conference and he was

948
00:54:46.991 --> 00:54:49.990
supposed to go and fight George San Pierre but they pulled him from the fight

949
00:54:49.991 --> 00:54:53.080
cause he missed a couple of press conferences.
So he made a video about it.

950
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.310
And this is a video,

951
00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:58.600
like a public video and he's in his car and as he's drive and making this video,

952
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.020
he was,
someone won't let him in.
He's like,
let me and let me fuck your mother.

953
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:07.270
Fuck your mother.
When people say Shit like that.
That's funny man.

954
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.060
Cause he wouldn't say fuck your mother if you were right in front of them.

955
00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:13.090
If you like some lady.
But you know.
But if you're a leg,

956
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.670
if it's a lady and then she's in a car in front of you,

957
00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.470
you don't even have to worry about hurting their feelings.

958
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.000
You can say the most ruthless

959
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:23.610
<v 10>Liz Shit Dude,
when I'm driving I try to chant to relax.
So I'll need to do I.</v>

960
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:27.840
Yes I do.
So I'll be chanting when I'm driving like knickers,
knickers,
not,

961
00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:30.150
I got it.
I'm on and I'm driving through traffic.
Eight drives.

962
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:35.151
I'm chanting to relax and inevitably someone will cut me off and in the middle

963
00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:38.880
of chanting I'd be like,
Yo,
you stupid fucking bitch.

964
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.790
<v 2>Oh,
that's hilarious.
That's what's really there.
You do?
That's a joke.</v>

965
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.570
You should say,
fuck.
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
You should talk about that on stage.

966
00:55:50.571 --> 00:55:54.260
You could,
you could go far with that content.
That's cool.
That's cool.
Yeah.

967
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.800
Well that's the unavoidable stress of living in cities.
There's too much tension.

968
00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:01.650
This,
this is not healthy.
You know,
we're all,
we're all a red lining everyday.

969
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.900
Yeah.
It's so weird.
Small communities are nicer.
It's just the,
you know,
y'all,

970
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:09.980
you deal with or you used to deal with in the age before the Internet,

971
00:56:09.981 --> 00:56:12.110
you dealt with a lot more small minded people.

972
00:56:12.111 --> 00:56:14.630
You dealt with a lot more religious Wackos.

973
00:56:14.631 --> 00:56:16.790
If you wanted to live in the woodland,
the middle of nowhere,

974
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.250
it's tough to get away from the really,
really religious people.

975
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:24.100
<v 10>You know what,
man?
I had a,
uh,
speaking of religious people,
I had a,
a real</v>

976
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:28.000
<v 1>American moment today where I was like,
man,
this is a pretty good country.
I was,</v>

977
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.670
cause they cause like,
you know,
the uh,

978
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.170
inception at birth thing that just got overturned.
Do you know about this?
No.

979
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.860
What does that so I can't,
can you see where it was,
man?
Was it a ma?

980
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.310
I can't remember where it was.
Uh,
can you look at faith for me?
Oh,

981
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.150
pro turf tilt the logo of your mic towards you.
Yeah.
You're talking to the side?

982
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.640
Yeah.
No,
no.
That logo on the front of them.

983
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.610
There's a thing on the right here in the mix.
You're like this?
Yeah.

984
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:49.660
So it's around here.

985
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:52.960
Look at the part where it's written and the point that towards your face.
Gotcha.

986
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.560
See it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got it.
There you go.
Ooh,
that sounds so much better.
Hello?

987
00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.970
There you go.
You're back.
Yeah,
man.
It's like person hooded at conception.

988
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:05.130
You another water.
Yeah,
I think that's what it's called.
It's called person.

989
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.660
So the,
I like,
it's this thing where they want it basically.

990
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.120
They want to say that.
I can't remember the exact words for it.

991
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:13.390
They have exact word for it.
I can't remember the term.
Okay.
Say it again.

992
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:15.940
Can set like say Ooh,
look up conception,

993
00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:20.410
personhood at conception or it's the ideas like w when you can,
when can set,

994
00:57:20.411 --> 00:57:22.900
when conception happens,
uh,
when,

995
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:27.850
when when the fucking eggs are in the uterine wall and are fertilized by a sperm

996
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:29.650
that is now a human being.
That's a person.

997
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:34.420
So they were trying to pass that which would make all forms of abortion illegal

998
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:39.250
and maybe even birth control depending on like how you look at it.
I,
so anyway,

999
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:40.031
it got overturned.

1000
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:42.760
The voters overturned it and they were thinking it wouldn't get overturned,

1001
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.510
but it was like super religious fundamentalists were trying,

1002
00:57:45.511 --> 00:57:48.220
when you see overturned,
you mean it passed?
It didn't pass.

1003
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.720
So they thought it was going up.
There it is.

1004
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:55.540
Well isn't overturned mean something person has passed and then overturned?

1005
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.670
No,
I'm sorry it didn't get voted for.
It didn't make it in.

1006
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.610
Is that a measure that didn't get voted for?

1007
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:03.970
It lost and people were saying it was going to,
uh,
it was going to win.

1008
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.920
So it was cool.

1009
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:09.910
The political system in that one case worked where they thought it wouldn't

1010
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.910
carry shit.
Scary Shit.
Well,
you know,
it's awesome,

1011
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.760
<v 5>Gary,
when you think about what abortion really is,
you know,
that's scary too.</v>

1012
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.080
I mean this,
you're,

1013
00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:20.200
you're taking a baby and you're sucking out of your pussy with a

1014
00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.170
<v 1>me too expensive.
Well,
there's different,
you know what man,
I'm,</v>

1015
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.650
there's a lot of versions of abortion that I think are fucking horrible and I,

1016
00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:32.330
and I totally am not four,
but there is some,
there is definitely cases.

1017
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.290
Oh yeah.
Whereas Shit where's should happen?
And you can not only that,
how about,

1018
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:35.400
yeah,

1019
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.233
<v 5>you know,</v>

1020
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.480
it's up to the person that's carrying that baby baby inside of them until the

1021
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:42.450
baby's born.
It's up to them.
I mean,
I think if,
you know,

1022
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.410
if you have an aborted kid that's perfectly healthy and it's like six months old

1023
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:48.090
inside your body,
like that's kind of crazy.

1024
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.160
But I know that people have done that in the past.

1025
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.360
<v 1>I think if it's not for a medical reason,
it's not,
you know,</v>

1026
00:58:53.361 --> 00:58:56.150
and I don't know if it's those fucking partial birth abortions.

1027
00:58:56.151 --> 00:59:00.860
You know about those,
right?
Yeah.
They ice pick the fucking brain of the baby.

1028
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:04.550
It's a baby.
I mean that's,
I think that's,
that's not,

1029
00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:07.310
that definitely shouldn't happen.
That's crazy.

1030
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.200
<v 5>That's crazy.
It's almost like I don't see it.</v>

1031
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.680
<v 1>Yeah,
I don't see it.
I'll say,
yeah,
I know he's talking about La la,
la,
la,
la,
la.</v>

1032
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.550
That's why I just put a blanket on your baby.

1033
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:18.720
Why don't you give birth to the thing and cover it and a blanket.

1034
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.220
Take it since it's inside the pussy and you see me sticking the icepick

1035
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.080
<v 3>in his head and it's all fine.
It's okay.</v>

1036
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.260
It was outside and I jab it in front of you and then chopped it up into pieces.

1037
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:28.490
He'd be like,
you just killed the anymore.

1038
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:33.140
If it came out for a second and you put it back in,
couldn't do it.

1039
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.860
Same Baby.
But if you pulled it out of the vagina and put it back in,

1040
00:59:36.861 --> 00:59:39.110
you couldn't ice pick at once.
It been in the air.

1041
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.120
The rule is once it's been in the air,

1042
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:44.300
you can't kill it as a person that's alive.
Yeah.
That's fucked up.

1043
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.420
That doesn't make sense or easy is it?
Yeah,
it's really strange.
I mean,

1044
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:51.350
and you know,
it's,
this is a taboo subject.
This is a subject you're supposed to,

1045
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:56.030
if you're a rational,
open minded person,
you're supposed to just favor choice.

1046
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:59.870
You know?
Which I,
I do.
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't think any should we be,

1047
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.520
I think it's a real slippery slope.

1048
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.220
It's a real slippery slope when someone tells you what you can and can't do with

1049
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:10.250
your body.
You know,
it seems like you're killing a baby,

1050
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.370
but I guess he should be able to do it.
You know what these are,

1051
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:15.850
and we've discussed this before,

1052
01:00:15.851 --> 01:00:18.200
it's so much easier when it's a small couple of cells.

1053
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:22.280
It's much easier to rationalize,
but it's on its way to being a baby,
you know?

1054
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.800
<v 10>Well,
just,
I,
it depends on where the thing is,
you know?
And,</v>

1055
01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:28.020
and it depends on it'll,
it depends on a lot of different things.

1056
01:00:28.021 --> 01:00:31.240
It's like everyone wants to make these sweeping things like [inaudible].

1057
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.670
The two sides of it are.
It should all the two extreme sides are.
It should be.

1058
01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.320
It should be illegal no matter what.

1059
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:42.590
Even if that rapist impregnated the woman and the baby's going to kill her,

1060
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.850
then h she should have that baby and we'll raise the baby.
Can

1061
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.950
<v 3>I have his name?
Say his name.
His name,
Lord Jesus Christ.</v>

1062
01:00:48.951 --> 01:00:50.790
We were raised that rapists baby Jesus Christ,

1063
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.160
and he could be the next president.
Now that's very stumble.
What's that?

1064
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.150
Do you see Rick Perry stumbled?
Yeah.
It was awesome.
It was hilarious.

1065
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.260
It was such a fucking,
it was uncomfortable to watch.

1066
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:07.130
That was hilarious to think that you don't know that.
Yeah.
He forgot.

1067
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:10.460
You don't know that.
You forgot that.
Yeah.
You're running for president.

1068
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:13.430
How the fuck are we going to let you keep track of the world's military
presence?

1069
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.750
Isn't he the executioner?

1070
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:19.880
Isn't Rick Perry the one who had like shit loads of people he executed in Texas,

1071
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.810
Texas?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He,
he's living controversial ones.

1072
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:26.920
He sends him to the Fryer.
Yeah.
They send a lot of them to the FRY,
which,

1073
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.360
you know,
listen,
if people are cons,
I kind of liked that.

1074
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.630
I liked getting rid of him,
but I don't trust the political system.

1075
01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.890
That's a problem.
Yeah.
That's the,
that is it.
That's number one.

1076
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.220
But Rick Perry's it.
You got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.
Kind of guys.

1077
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:44.570
Like if I got to fucking kill a couple of Nice people to fry a bunch of
assholes,

1078
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:49.460
then well that's the price you pay for.
Uh,
for liberty.
Yeah.

1079
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:53.280
He is one of those guys,
right?
Yeah.
That's what he's like.
He's,
you know,
he's a,

1080
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:57.230
he's a,
he's a fucking assholes.
What he is,
man.
I mean,
you can't,

1081
01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.090
it's like that's the main thing.
Until we perfect the system,
the death,

1082
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.500
the government,
they'll legal system.
You can't have the death penalty.
You can't,

1083
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:07.251
it,
it's not,

1084
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:12.251
part of being a citizen of the United States does not mean that you've got to

1085
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:15.680
race being falsely imprisoned and executed.
Uh,

1086
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.560
because the legal system isn't perfect.
That's wrong.
You into.

1087
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.430
You can't give the ultimate punishment

1088
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.560
<v 1>unless you've really perfected the system.</v>

1089
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:28.350
We know till we know 100% I know there's way better methods now than they've

1090
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:32.370
ever been before.
When you include genetics and just,
I've watched CSI,

1091
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.140
I'm pretty sure I'm up to what they're up to,
but still it was still fucking,

1092
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.820
there's a lot of doubt in some cases.
Is this in is also fucking shady cops,

1093
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:46.440
man.
There's people plant evidence.
They plant evidence.
It happens all the time.

1094
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.400
You know,
it's,
it's not something that's never taken place in the history of man.

1095
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.040
It is most certainly taking place.
It's been proven.
So you,

1096
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:59.050
you got to know your system is fucking air tight and it's just not.
I'll say,

1097
01:02:59.051 --> 01:03:02.310
what if someone actually reforms?
Yeah.
While they're in prison.

1098
01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.550
What if someone has actually now at a good person,

1099
01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.840
are you still going to kill him?
It depends on what they did.
If they kill people,

1100
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.830
say,
Eh,
I'm biblical on that man.

1101
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.680
You're Shiria on that.
Yeah.
My friend Sharia law,
I think there's a,

1102
01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:21.930
there's certain justifiable homicides,
you know,
I think,
I believe in that.

1103
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:23.790
I believe in,
if someone's trying to kill you,

1104
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.180
like I heard this a story who told me the star was at you about the death metal

1105
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:31.480
band.
Yeah.
You tell me.
Tell me the story you told me on the plane.
Yeah.
Okay.

1106
01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:37.020
So here's the story.
There's a perfect example of justifiable homicides.

1107
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:41.790
The at documentary on Norwegian death metal that I saw on Netflix.

1108
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.360
So if I fuck up this story for death metal fans out there,
I apologize,

1109
01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:49.320
I'm going to tell it as best as I can remember it.
But so the idea is there is,

1110
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:53.820
it's Ah,
it's about Burzum there.
Basically it's about this group,
you know,

1111
01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:56.760
like how like Ah,
where did punk form did pot?
We're in,

1112
01:03:56.761 --> 01:04:00.660
in the UK forms and there's like a group of like punk bands.

1113
01:04:00.661 --> 01:04:01.980
Wherever there's an art movement,

1114
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.420
there's a group of artists who are like the core of the,

1115
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.950
the movement or even in like music,
you know,
like with gangster rap,

1116
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.330
there was Nwa,
there's a bunch of tea,
right?
And they all kind of formed together.

1117
01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:17.160
So Norway's answer to that is Norwegian death metal.

1118
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:21.960
Where are these fucking guys decide that they're going to go hard core and be

1119
01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:26.400
like truly,
truly as dark as you can get.
Terrible people.
Terrible.

1120
01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:31.170
Well they like,
so they started burning down churches.

1121
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.000
They started going through the countryside,

1122
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:37.800
burning down churches and a one in one of the bands,

1123
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.780
one of the band members,
uh,

1124
01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.670
it was so depressed because he's a in the death metal and that's all they think

1125
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:46.950
about his death,
that he goes back to his house,

1126
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.910
puts a gun in his mouth and blows his brains out.

1127
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.400
And the other guy in the band comes to the house,

1128
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:56.430
sees his dead body,

1129
01:04:56.670 --> 01:05:01.670
takes a picture of his fucking head and uses that as the cover their next town.

1130
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.260
Shit.
Fucking hardcore man.

1131
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:11.750
So they're burning down churches and uh,
Burzum,
uh,

1132
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:15.540
Burzum hears that this other guy who was this competitor or these,

1133
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.350
he was a and had some history where the ear that this guy was saying,
yeah,

1134
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.770
I'm going to,
I'm going to kill.
I'm going to kill him.
I'm just going to kill him.

1135
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.880
And uh,
he was bragging about how he's going to kill him.
So this guy's like,

1136
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.990
oh well,
okay.
He wants to kill me.

1137
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:35.080
He's going to kill me so I'm going to have to kill him first.

1138
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:38.410
And he got in his car and he drove to where the guy was fucking executed.

1139
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:41.050
The Guy,
he killed him.
He went to jail is in jail and Norway.

1140
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.520
Oh play Burzum receiving his life sentence.
Wait to see this.

1141
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:47.800
Can we play that on Youtube?
Oh I think so.

1142
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.000
So he gets like not wives than it is a movie.
Brian,
how is here,

1143
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.760
I'm noticing this before we play this,
how would you have me reversed?

1144
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.370
You have my left hand.
My right hand and my right hand,
my left hand.

1145
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.350
It's so freaking me out.
It's so that they,

1146
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.860
it looks like we're all talking to each other.
Oh that's cool.

1147
01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:05.890
Oh that's so bizarre.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look up.
Uh,

1148
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:10.870
Burzum received senates and it's really weird cause the guy gets like a 27 year

1149
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:14.380
sentence in prison cause that's how they can give in Norway and he gets it.
Yeah.

1150
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:17.200
And he gives the creepiest smile.
Whoa.
He just saw.

1151
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:20.140
How many years have you been in for?
I think,
I don't know.

1152
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:22.420
I don't follow a death metal that much.

1153
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.200
You can only get 27 years old and what you did,
something like that.
God,

1154
01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:28.080
I feel like,
I'm sorry man.
You guys.
If I know,

1155
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:30.660
I feel like I've thrown out some like wonky facts.

1156
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:36.820
We have a fuzzy understanding of everyday.
The guy's name again.
Uh,
Burzum.
B,
U,
R,

1157
01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:37.840
z u m

1158
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.630
Vlade Vlade something [inaudible] or something.
Vlade vagueness.

1159
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.160
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1160
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.010
<v 1>Let me see.
Yeah,
that's him.
What does it say?
Yeah,</v>

1161
01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:56.260
this one.
That's the guy who did it.
That's the guy.

1162
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:57.820
They were burning down churches,
man.

1163
01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.600
They were burning down these antique wooden churches if someone wanted to kill

1164
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:04.510
him.
Yeah,
Greg,
that shit.
Let me hear that.

1165
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:05.963
<v 6>All right.</v>

1166
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:11.540
<v 11>Fit and lift.</v>

1167
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.090
Fucking city.

1168
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:27.780
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1169
01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.860
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1170
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:37.410
[inaudible] [inaudible] selves is fine.

1171
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.373
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1172
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.000
<v 1>That's gets fucking prison in Norway is like a country club.
Is it really?</v>

1173
01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.050
Oh yeah,
man.
It's nice,
dude.
They've got nice prisons there.
Really?
Yeah.

1174
01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.830
It's not like the US prisons.

1175
01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:54.770
They Norway's got this really fucking intense ethic about reforming people.

1176
01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:55.970
They really want to reform people.

1177
01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:59.870
Their prison systems are based on reformation rather than revenge.

1178
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:03.440
Like in the United States.
It's like exacting punishment.
We must punish you.

1179
01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:06.560
We are going to take it out of your hide there.
They're like,
look,
let's,

1180
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.550
let's try to fix them.
Maybe there's a way to make it so that,
uh,

1181
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.580
they don't go back into society,
you know,
as criminal stuff,

1182
01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.040
we might be able to just fix them,
you

1183
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.160
<v 5>know,
fix the problem.
Wow.
Cause I mean the death penalty you don't have,</v>

1184
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:22.610
how do you feel about that?
I think it's genius.
You think it's,
it does it work?

1185
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.550
Uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno the,
you know,
if it works,
it's great.
You know,

1186
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:30.350
when we were in England,
do you remember,
uh,

1187
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.400
there was a moment where like I was talking to the crowd about how polite people

1188
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:37.940
are in England.
Like is this crazy?
Like this is so different than America.

1189
01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.150
The way people act and the way people behave,
the crowds,

1190
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.310
they're just so different.
And in Norway,

1191
01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.960
they're probably like pretty Nice folks for the most bat.
Right.

1192
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.330
This is what they're trying to do.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1193
01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:52.970
Think how nice and friendly people are in England.
And this is probably,

1194
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.740
it's probably real similar in Norway.

1195
01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.040
It's almost like that system has to be in place almost from the get go.

1196
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:05.150
It's like once you get as rotten as the,
the,

1197
01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:09.320
the prison system that we have today to take those people and just shoved them

1198
01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:13.190
in the country clubs and make everything nice and fun and easy.

1199
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.140
<v 10>Well,
we,
but we don't see,
the thing is,
man,
we,
there's so many other,
well,</v>

1200
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.220
you know,
there's the,
what do they call it?
What did,

1201
01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:22.100
<v 5>can I call him?
Does he think that that would ever possibly work?</v>

1202
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.700
<v 10>You have to,
I think you have to make sense.
Some,
uh,
pharmaceuticals,</v>

1203
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.580
you have to be able to legally give them mushrooms and psychedelics in

1204
01:09:30.581 --> 01:09:35.350
combination with like really radical therapies to reform them.
And I,

1205
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.200
we're not along the way they're thinking and you can't do that now.

1206
01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:42.850
You can't do that now.
But they used to,
Timothy leary was doing it with a Alpert.

1207
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:46.480
They were doing,
uh,
experiments with rev reforming prisoners,

1208
01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:48.910
and they would go into jails and eat mushrooms with the prisoners.

1209
01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:52.660
They would trip with the prisoners.
Whoa.
Yeah.
And it was a,
you know,
it's,

1210
01:09:52.661 --> 01:09:55.930
it's anyone who's done a psychedelic,
if you think about it,
you're like,
oh yeah,

1211
01:09:55.931 --> 01:09:59.540
this could really,
this.
If anything can,
uh,

1212
01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:04.030
fix a person's deep psychic problems,
this could do it if was,

1213
01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:08.170
if it was done the right way,
you know,
but we,
because of the,
what is,
uh,

1214
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.560
what did mechanical at the pharmacological inquisition that is happening right

1215
01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:15.340
now,
these substances are you,
you can barely even experiment with them.

1216
01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.550
And now that they have Johns Hopkins University is saying,
Oh yeah,

1217
01:10:18.551 --> 01:10:22.600
if you eat mushrooms,
it'll improve your personality.
Yeah.
You know,
so,

1218
01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:26.080
so maybe that's the key.
Maybe,
you know,
the,
the,

1219
01:10:26.081 --> 01:10:29.200
the Hopkins study will lead to more studies,
which will lead to,
you know,

1220
01:10:29.201 --> 01:10:32.200
treatments for like,
people who have,

1221
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:37.030
are all these studies when they get,
do they do these studies?

1222
01:10:37.031 --> 01:10:37.930
All these people they're taking,

1223
01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:40.660
these studies are usually people that need money and probably are depressed

1224
01:10:40.661 --> 01:10:44.140
anyway.
So the probably made everybody's life a happy.

1225
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:45.390
They see the thing is mandate.

1226
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.210
I mean like if they don't take like really nice wealthy,
uh,

1227
01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:51.190
golfers that are retired on Florida go,
hey,
take this study.

1228
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:54.430
They're probably taking like people that need the a quick $300.
No,

1229
01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:56.410
they're very strict about it.
They have like when they do,

1230
01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.920
when they're getting applicants,
especially for big studies like these,

1231
01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:04.060
they have like that's part of the,
when the FDA is approving this shit,
right.

1232
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:06.280
That's part of,
that's a big part of what they go through.

1233
01:11:06.281 --> 01:11:08.290
It's like where are you getting your control group?
Where are you getting your,

1234
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.230
where are you getting your group from the,
you're doing the study on.

1235
01:11:11.231 --> 01:11:16.170
Because if it was like you're thinking about the way they do tests for TV shows,

1236
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:17.431
you know what I'm saying?

1237
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:21.450
That like is the studies like the same that I used to do in college or are these

1238
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:25.320
studies like a bunch of poor people?
Are they a mix of these studies?

1239
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:28.650
Because the John Hopkins study where they're studying students,
you can look up,

1240
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.080
there's like housewives and the Johns Hopkins Studies.

1241
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:35.190
They were like intentionally trying to find people who are like not as familiar

1242
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:38.310
with mushrooms or hadn't taken them because it needed a quick few hundred

1243
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:41.250
dollars for this study.
You know what I'm saying?
That's what I was saying.
Yeah.

1244
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.590
Yeah.
I,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know man.
And to your point,

1245
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.530
because all those people,
if they take mushrooms,

1246
01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.010
their life's going to feel better because they're fucking,
I don't like,
to me,

1247
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:52.210
I don't like eating mushrooms and I'm fucking broke.
And if I was in a,

1248
01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.770
I don't know that,
I don't know that.
I don't know that.
I don't know the income.

1249
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.010
I know that sucks.
When you're tripping and you start thinking about bills,

1250
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:00.970
that's a fucking shitty.

1251
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.130
<v 4>Well,
yeah,
it depends on how much it weighs on you.
For some people,
um,</v>

1252
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:08.070
when you're broke,
it's,
it's,
it's all day.
It weighs on you.

1253
01:12:08.071 --> 01:12:10.080
Other people could just kind of brush it off and they don't,

1254
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:11.280
they don't seem to give a fuck.

1255
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:15.570
<v 10>I consider it a party drug,
like I want to fucking leave this reality.
I want to,</v>

1256
01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:17.120
it's just get the fuck out of this.

1257
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:21.940
<v 4>That's what you consider Masha?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I do too.
But along the way,
uh,
you know,</v>

1258
01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:24.020
it's,
Oh,
it's always this white knuckle ride.
We,

1259
01:12:24.021 --> 01:12:27.900
you're scared as far before you do it.
And then once you do it,
you realize,
God,

1260
01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:31.700
why was I ever scared of this?
And then after it's over you,
you know,

1261
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:35.190
you sort of assess whatever you've kind of absorbed whatever fish you've caught

1262
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:37.410
and you're golden net.
That's cool man.
No,

1263
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.530
<v 10>yeah,
you catch some fish.
I have,
but I never mushrooms,</v>

1264
01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:44.670
I've never thought of them as like a park go out party drug.
I,
I,
you know,

1265
01:12:44.671 --> 01:12:49.230
like in the o and the days when I would take it a acid was that like I could go

1266
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:53.730
out and like have fun or like go out into the,
I wanted to go,
I'd go to,
like,

1267
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:56.720
when I was a kid,
you go to shopping malls and trip just

1268
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.040
<v 4>for get to a point where you weren't lucid.</v>

1269
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:02.470
Like you couldn't communicate with LSD.
Yeah.
Like we were talking,

1270
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.430
you are out and you're talking to people and you just can't keep it together.

1271
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:06.660
Like you can't communicate with them.

1272
01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.030
<v 10>Ah,
you not when I was out,
I mean I've taken,</v>

1273
01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:13.420
like I took a really powerful dose and tried to have a conversation with a girl.

1274
01:13:13.421 --> 01:13:16.750
I always take,
I was taking it with,
and I sounded like a schizophrenia.

1275
01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:21.070
I was having like word salad cause like we had just gone to some Greek festival

1276
01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.970
and I had watched these little kids dancing and,

1277
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:26.890
and I was like sitting watching these kids like doing some weird Greek

1278
01:13:26.891 --> 01:13:28.900
traditional dance.
And it was like,

1279
01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:34.150
it felt like I could see through the concrete and it,
I felt like there was like,

1280
01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:38.560
it just felt like this beautiful moment where it was like,
the universe is like,

1281
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:41.830
you know,
the,
this is like watching a flower.

1282
01:13:41.831 --> 01:13:44.040
Like it's a traditional weird dances.

1283
01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:47.670
It's so cool the way the universe can express beauty in that way.
And Yeah.

1284
01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:52.390
So I was like tripping and sitting on the couch and I'm trying to like tell her

1285
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:58.130
universe,
wow.
Flower Brie.
Beautiful God.

1286
01:13:58.131 --> 01:13:59.390
Yeah.
You know,

1287
01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:04.310
I kind of word salad just cause I was so like spellbound and also tripping.

1288
01:14:04.311 --> 01:14:07.420
So are my language centers have gotten fucked up.
I mean,

1289
01:14:07.421 --> 01:14:11.980
when you see someone on a heavy dose of acid,
they have a problem.
They like

1290
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.250
<v 3>their language gets all mixed up and weird.
My last shrimp thing,</v>

1291
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:16.240
I couldn't even walk.
I,

1292
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:19.030
that was the first time I ever did a second dog where I couldn't use my feet.

1293
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:23.230
I fell two.
Wow.
That's crazy.
Fell to the ground.
The presence of Jay's up.

1294
01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.120
Praise his name.
Dude.
You want to hear my podcast prayer?
Yeah,
I do.

1295
01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:30.050
<v 5>But uh,
I wanted to ask you something and I just forgot what I wanted to ask you.</v>

1296
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.730
Um,
oh.
Oh.

1297
01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.540
Did you know that Ted Kaczynski was involved in the Harvard LSD study?

1298
01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:39.890
You told me that fucking crazy man.
There's a whole documentary about it.

1299
01:14:39.891 --> 01:14:41.720
It's not an American one.
It's called the net.

1300
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.440
And it's all about how they caught him and saw about what,
you know,

1301
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:48.590
how he got started and he,
you know,
there's,

1302
01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.280
I think there's certain people that are accusing that study of a wrecking his

1303
01:14:55.701 --> 01:14:59.300
brain,
you know,
and that he was a fairly normal guy.

1304
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:04.220
And once he went through the LSD study,
they cut down.
They cooked his mind.

1305
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:08.020
Yeah.
And they probably gave him crazy high doses.
I don't think they do it.

1306
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:11.240
I don't think they knew back then.
They didn't know they were fucking around.

1307
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:13.190
You know,
I think there was a lot of experiments,

1308
01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.750
<v 3>no way.
They knew man.
They were just fine.
Who knows?</v>

1309
01:15:15.751 --> 01:15:20.751
They had no idea how they know what the 32 ounce of acids could have been.

1310
01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:22.200
Man.
It could have been.

1311
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:25.620
They did that study shit to people who made some big mistakes.
Man.

1312
01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.230
People made some big mistakes.
They tried to cover it.
Yeah.

1313
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.830
<v 5>Though they tried to cover the fact that Kaczynski was a part of their,
uh,</v>

1314
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.250
their studies because it's a real embarrassment.
I mean,
I don't know,

1315
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:38.310
when I say they,
I don't even know who the fuck they are.
I might've made that up.

1316
01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.170
How about that?
But what did happen,

1317
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.400
what did happen is the guy became a professor of mathematics for a few years
out,

1318
01:15:44.401 --> 01:15:46.200
I think it was university of California Berkeley.

1319
01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.440
And he just did it to make enough money to buy this cabin in the woods and plot

1320
01:15:51.811 --> 01:15:56.670
his attack on technologist.
He was gone,
man.
He was gone.

1321
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:59.040
This guy was out alone in the woods.

1322
01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:02.760
If you don't know the story of the Unabomber,
you know,
if you're a young child,

1323
01:16:02.761 --> 01:16:05.490
if you're coming to us under the age of 20,

1324
01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:07.380
you might not even have ever heard of it before.

1325
01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.660
But it was a guy who was a brilliant,

1326
01:16:09.661 --> 01:16:13.500
brilliant guy who was targeting all these various people that were involved in

1327
01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:18.090
technology and fucking blowing their heads off getting mail bomb.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1328
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.150
And he was doing it all from a fucking shack in the middle of

1329
01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.220
<v 3>building mailbox,
unit bottling.
Yeah.
I remember.</v>

1330
01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:25.710
That's what that was like a sketch that they had of him.

1331
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.740
<v 5>And,
um,
he,
uh,</v>

1332
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:32.970
was a really terrorizing people for a long time and they were having a really

1333
01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:36.240
hard time figuring out who the fuck he was.
They knew he was a genius,

1334
01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:38.100
but they couldn't figure out who he was.

1335
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:43.200
And then he released a manifesto and his brother read the manifesto and his

1336
01:16:43.201 --> 01:16:45.480
brother said he knew,
he said he knew right away it's like,

1337
01:16:45.481 --> 01:16:47.550
oh this is my crazy ass fucking psycho brother.

1338
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.840
Lost his mind to Lsd who's living in the woods in a box.

1339
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.660
He's got like this wooden box that he lives in,
in the middle of the woods.

1340
01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.970
He thought the technology was eventually going to a takeover and technology was

1341
01:16:59.971 --> 01:17:00.990
the enemy and it was a,

1342
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:04.400
<v 3>yeah,
there's a whole form of like anarchy.
There's a geyser.</v>

1343
01:17:04.401 --> 01:17:08.030
Zahn if you look up John Zerzan,
I think his name was,
heard that name before.

1344
01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:12.710
Yeah.
From this intense,
like an artist.
He was like technology,

1345
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:17.660
which is weird cause he's got a blog but Kosinski um,
was right in a way though,

1346
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:18.140
right?

1347
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.730
I mean technology is sort of taking over our lives and eventually it's going to

1348
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:25.370
be a part of our lives permanently.
You know,

1349
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:29.950
once you start going to a what does zero Zan,
I mean you,

1350
01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:32.860
you start getting to the point where people become human hybrids.
You know,
we,

1351
01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:35.360
when we become cyborgs,
you know,

1352
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:38.360
technology literally will take oh yeah totally man.

1353
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:39.710
I mean it's like there he saw,

1354
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.580
I mean he saw a path and I mean it's a horrible thing that he did but it's

1355
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:48.530
fascinating that blowing his brain out on acid would make them reach that

1356
01:17:48.531 --> 01:17:52.760
conclusion.
I mean I'm,
I might be simplifying his position.
It was a factor.

1357
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:54.170
It was probably a factor.

1358
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:59.171
If the guy was already imbalanced or was already off taking like heavy doses of

1359
01:17:59.571 --> 01:18:03.380
Harvard LSD back in,
back in the day,
that's not going to help you.

1360
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:05.540
Do you think it's possible to do that to a person?
That's fine.

1361
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:09.100
Do you think you could take like you that just blast your fucking brain up.

1362
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.560
You never come back?
Fuck yeah.
Like what about Mk ultra?

1363
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:16.400
The government experiments with mind control and like the idea of creating a

1364
01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:19.940
psychedelic bomb.
I thought you're talking about Maddy Kirsch.
No,

1365
01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:26.070
that's Maddie curses getting ah yeah.
Mk Ultra Man.
Look that shit up.
Yeah.
So the,

1366
01:18:26.071 --> 01:18:28.880
the a psychedelic bomb.
What do you mean?
Like what were they trying to do?

1367
01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.620
They're trying,
that's if you ever seen Jacob's ladder.
Yes.
That's,
yeah,

1368
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:37.060
it's like that,
that it's like the idea is they were um,
uh,

1369
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:42.130
they were experimenting with some kind of Psychedelic that you could drop on

1370
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:46.400
troops like a nerve agent.
They would,
they would just all trip out,

1371
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:49.940
fall down and trip out,
fight if you're tripping really out charge enough.

1372
01:18:49.941 --> 01:18:53.870
So true.
So like that it was like they were a great idea.
That is a great idea.

1373
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:58.850
Yeah.
Just bonk everybody out on acid and,
sure.
Fucking love bond.
A bond.

1374
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:03.560
They wanted it to explode in the air and somehow or another everybody would get

1375
01:19:03.561 --> 01:19:06.570
infected with acid.
I don't know how they were going to fucking distribute it.

1376
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:09.500
It was probably gas.
If you would think that Lsd,

1377
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:12.760
you just need a tiny amount of LSD or the,
so it's,

1378
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:17.130
it was explained this shit wasn't Lsd,
Joe.
This was like new something,

1379
01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:20.990
something they were trying to make to give you fucked up trips to give you.
Like,

1380
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:23.680
it wasn't like they wanted to give you a nice LSD trip.
This,

1381
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:25.580
some of the stuff they whipped up.
Yeah,

1382
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:28.340
but I mean even if it was just a strong LSD,
if you it,

1383
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:32.300
if you blew it on the troops,
they'd be jacked.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
Duncan,

1384
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.030
LSD troops,
troops.
No,

1385
01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:38.240
it was a big shift that they're talking about is like are they were like,

1386
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:43.220
it was a bad like bad trip.
It's like a,
an evil death trip.

1387
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.120
It's not a good trip.

1388
01:19:44.121 --> 01:19:47.680
And everybody would just fall down and be twitching in this trip.
Well,

1389
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:52.280
but is that more humane than the new kingdom killing them?
Which is better.

1390
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:55.970
That's better for sure.
Maybe Richard Bell.
It's better than new customer.

1391
01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.690
If you ever met a guy that likes bad trips,
like that was like,

1392
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.040
that was his bondage.
Like,
I just need to worst trinkets as fetish.
Oh,

1393
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.960
I guess I'm,
but yeah,
you know that's a real terror though.

1394
01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:08.070
People pretend they like terror.
Nobody

1395
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.880
<v 4>likes terror.</v>

1396
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.570
You pretend you like terror cause he's want to be different or dangerous or

1397
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.600
moody or dark.
But real

1398
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:19.500
<v 3>Tara bad trips are now know what that bitch did I ever tell you about the time I</v>

1399
01:20:19.501 --> 01:20:20.790
saw a

1400
01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.690
<v 10>woman freaking out on acid at a rave?
No,
we were leaving.</v>

1401
01:20:25.691 --> 01:20:26.411
It was in the morning.

1402
01:20:26.411 --> 01:20:30.220
It's me and my friend were leaving and this girl walks east girls like crying

1403
01:20:30.221 --> 01:20:33.910
and standing by herself and we went after,
I'm like,
you all right.

1404
01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.670
It can we help you.
And she's like,

1405
01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:39.530
I lost my friends and

1406
01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:44.320
I can't find them.
We're like,
okay,
well why don't we,
where did,
you know?

1407
01:20:44.321 --> 01:20:47.830
We're like,
we'll give you a ride home.
We'll take you home.
Um,
where do you live?

1408
01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.560
Or do you have a car here?
We're trying to help her out.

1409
01:20:50.561 --> 01:20:52.660
Her eyes were fucking black.

1410
01:20:52.661 --> 01:20:57.661
Is that as night black is the wings are silages dilated like so we're like,

1411
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:58.763
so we're good.

1412
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:02.410
So we're walking up the steps with her and all of a sudden she goes

1413
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.413
<v 12>is,</v>

1414
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:15.210
<v 10>she's just screaming and we're like,
oh fuck,</v>

1415
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:20.070
this is a real bad trip.
She's melting down so we get to the top of the steps.

1416
01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.100
She's all of a sudden she's back to normal and she's like,
my friends,

1417
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:25.500
I can't find my friends.
And I really liked it.

1418
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.550
So we look over and there's some paramedics and we waved him down.

1419
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.160
They get her,
put her on a table straps.
We're just strapped her down.

1420
01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:40.140
And the last thing I saw her was on a fucking table in front of a rave writhing

1421
01:21:40.141 --> 01:21:40.974
and going back into

1422
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:50.340
<v 3>drought.
Yeah,
they had two matches having a psychotic break.
She lost it.</v>

1423
01:21:50.341 --> 01:21:54.510
She took some shit and freaked the fuck out.
And that was from acid.
I don't know.

1424
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:56.700
I mean something that dilated her eyes could have been a million thing.

1425
01:21:56.730 --> 01:22:01.470
Don't eat the brown ass,
don't eat the brown acid,
don't eat.

1426
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.260
That's the key.
That to me with my luck,

1427
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:07.350
it feels like that's something I would have heard right after I'd eat and the

1428
01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:08.184
Brown.
I said,

1429
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:13.310
I did take someone to just swallow it that don't eat the brown acid.

1430
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.510
That's the problem with drugs being illegal.

1431
01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.520
You don't know what the fuck are you going to get.
Yeah.
And you don't,

1432
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:18.840
and most people don't know how to take them.

1433
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.380
No one educates people on how to take them.
So you end up with some fucking dumb,

1434
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:26.790
dopey kid who slurps back too much acid or whatever at a fucking rave and ends

1435
01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:31.050
up in a mental asylum probably for how many people you think have gone crazy

1436
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:33.810
because of acid.
Has anybody gone crazy because of anything else?

1437
01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.320
Like no one's gone crazy because at mushrooms,
right.
I don't know.

1438
01:22:37.321 --> 01:22:40.530
Has that ever happened?
I've never heard of that.
I think if you're borderline,

1439
01:22:40.531 --> 01:22:43.650
anything could definitely push you over to show over.
Easy.
Sorry.
Yeah.

1440
01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:45.590
<v 4>Um,
I remember,
uh,</v>

1441
01:22:45.650 --> 01:22:50.650
one particular DMT trip where reality was real slippery for like two weeks

1442
01:22:50.751 --> 01:22:55.340
afterwards where,
um,
I felt like I might be a little crazy.

1443
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:57.800
I remember I felt like,
like this is a,

1444
01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.760
I've seen something that doesn't make any sense.

1445
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:05.950
And Co and I got there so easy and it's so much more vibrant,
this world

1446
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.520
<v 5>that it's,
it's very difficult for me to accept this world.</v>

1447
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:13.090
So I start looking at this world as if this world might be some sort of an

1448
01:23:13.091 --> 01:23:16.390
artificial construct and that might be the real world.
It's a,

1449
01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:21.820
it sounds completely retarded until you've had a real full blown psychedelic

1450
01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:26.410
trip because when you have a real full blown one,
that world that you enter,

1451
01:23:26.411 --> 01:23:29.080
whatever the fuck that is,
that world of hallucination.

1452
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:33.130
I mean hallucination is a strange word because it implies something.

1453
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.030
You see something that's not there.
Yeah.

1454
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:38.530
And I'm not necessarily sure that that's the correct way to look at it.

1455
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:41.710
I think you,
you might be seeing something that is there,

1456
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:44.890
but you just can't see normally.
I think that's more likely.
I don't,

1457
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.920
I don't think,
I mean,
I think,
you know,
people see fucking,
you know,

1458
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.330
a six foot tall rabbit then wants to take you to a,
a secret room.
Yeah.

1459
01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:53.290
You're probably hallucinating.

1460
01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.260
<v 1>Yeah.
You are definitely elites.
If you're not,
you're in fucking trouble.
But</v>

1461
01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.620
<v 5>go so far that the world around you has dissolved you,</v>

1462
01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:05.210
you know,
at that point in time,
this might not be imagination.

1463
01:24:05.211 --> 01:24:06.650
This might be another reality.

1464
01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.040
It might be something that you're just not capable of tuning into a regular

1465
01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:12.400
base.

1466
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.510
<v 1>See,
this is a pro.
This,</v>

1467
01:24:13.511 --> 01:24:17.050
this makes me think of a problem that I think is going to happen in the future,

1468
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:21.450
which is that once they figure out how to like neurally,
uh,

1469
01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:23.050
put video games in your mind,

1470
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:28.510
people are going to start having these real big problems differentiating,
uh,

1471
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.330
virtual reality from actual reality.

1472
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:35.020
And there's going to be some serious problems up ahead.
Because I,
it's like,

1473
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:37.930
imagine,
you know,
what's the new,

1474
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:42.700
what's the modern warfare three they just came out like,
imagine that,

1475
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.080
you know,
six generations of consoles and computers down the line,
right?

1476
01:24:48.081 --> 01:24:51.370
You know,
and it's so whatever that is,
however they taste good,

1477
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.700
they're going to feel it.
They might have smells involved in it,

1478
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.020
but what happens when that reality gets so good at?

1479
01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.780
You can no longer distinguish realities.

1480
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:03.280
You can no longer distinguish virtual worlds,

1481
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:07.210
worlds from real worlds because they're triggering the same thing in your brain.

1482
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:10.330
That reality is triggering right now.
But they're doing with computers,

1483
01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.740
so it's indistinguishable.
So how do you know when you've turned off the game?

1484
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:19.270
How do you know when you're not playing anymore?
This is hippy talked man.

1485
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:22.960
Oh fuck.
This is what if man,
you're right,
you're right.
I don't think this is a,

1486
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:25.750
what if I die?
I will admit to a million.
What else?
But this,

1487
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.940
this seems like if you think of where a talk,

1488
01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:30.430
if you think of where it's Hari was back in the,

1489
01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:33.040
when we remember when Atari came out,
you remember that Shit,
right?

1490
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.700
And you saw that for me it was like,
Holy Shit.

1491
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:40.260
<v 5>You have to consider the possibility that if this life is some sort of an</v>

1492
01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:43.970
illusion that it's some sort of an everchanging illusion and that you're

1493
01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.910
constantly in a part of it.
And maybe when you have these psychedelic trips,

1494
01:25:47.911 --> 01:25:51.900
you wake up temporarily from the illusion,
maybe psychedelics.
So like,
like,

1495
01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.650
like that sniffing shit they give you when you get knocked.

1496
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.790
<v 1>Yeah.
Smelling Salts was,
huh?
What's going on,
right.
Yeah.
Am I,</v>

1497
01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:04.050
yeah,
that's it.
Maybe that's what it is.
Yeah,
I know that's

1498
01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.200
<v 2>is the work of fiction or get appears to be.</v>

1499
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.460
<v 10>Yeah.
This is just some kind of like,</v>

1500
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.640
or it's just like really low down on the spectrum of awareness.

1501
01:26:12.641 --> 01:26:13.720
I mean it is happening,

1502
01:26:13.721 --> 01:26:17.310
but you're only seeing one tiny pixel of the bigger thing.
It does

1503
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.060
<v 2>many times feel like it's a work of fiction though,
doesn't it?</v>

1504
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:22.720
<v 10>Yeah.
Well yeah.</v>

1505
01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.740
Can I tell you when it really felt like a work of fiction when we flew on Air

1506
01:26:26.741 --> 01:26:31.330
France first fucking class to the UK,
that was for me,

1507
01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:32.164
it got really,

1508
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.400
really surreal and weird when we were sitting in that lounge.

1509
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:40.180
Like this was like,
I never fly first class.
Uh,

1510
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:44.530
so this was the kind of first class that I'd read about.
Uh,
if,

1511
01:26:44.531 --> 01:26:48.850
if you're out there and you've never flown Air France first class,
first of all,

1512
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.510
um,
please stay away from me cause I don't like talking with people who haven't

1513
01:26:52.511 --> 01:26:56.530
flown first class Air France.
But you,
I felt corrupted in the first 30 minutes.

1514
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.810
I was like,
Holy Shit,
this is,

1515
01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:03.130
this is so like different from any other flight.

1516
01:27:03.131 --> 01:27:08.131
It made every other first class experience I've had seem like shit seem like it

1517
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:09.120
was.

1518
01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.760
<v 2>Well,
you know it was really creepy.
You know what a creepy movie they did,
man,</v>

1519
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:14.670
what everybody was there was first class,
which is really nice.

1520
01:27:14.671 --> 01:27:15.720
Then there was business class,

1521
01:27:15.721 --> 01:27:18.270
which is still really nice and then there was coach,
which always sucks.

1522
01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:20.340
Well we got up,

1523
01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:24.870
the plane landed and a lady went through the aisle telling the business class

1524
01:27:24.871 --> 01:27:27.960
people to get out of the way and let the first class people get off the plane.

1525
01:27:27.961 --> 01:27:28.794
Yes.

1526
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:32.090
<v 10>It's like titanic shit.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,</v>

1527
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:34.970
but I've never seen anyone do it as aggressively as this lady did it.

1528
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:38.140
He almost pushed a guy back.
There was a guy was trying to get through to them.

1529
01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.470
No Sir,
no,
no.
Stay there and then we all walked by.
They,

1530
01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:44.040
if you have a connecting flight,

1531
01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:49.460
there's a bond girl basically waiting in some kind of town car that picks you up

1532
01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.370
and drives you to the security checking.

1533
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:56.310
You go through the security check in there.
They're basically,

1534
01:27:56.311 --> 01:27:59.820
they're treating you like you're a toddler.

1535
01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.910
They take you through the security check in and then you go up to this lounge.

1536
01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:07.280
There's this Special Air France Lounge and Paris and we're sitting there,

1537
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:09.090
Robin Williams walks Robin Williams.

1538
01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.890
That's where state things seem like fiction where it's like,
oh,
okay.
Really?

1539
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.390
<v 2>I don't know him.
I didn't want to bug them.</v>

1540
01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.750
<v 10>Yeah,
we didn't say high,
but it was very weird.
Bug the fuck</v>

1541
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:23.300
<v 2>I will.
I've been bugged so long I don't need to talk to him.</v>

1542
01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.470
I was nervous,
you know?

1543
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.580
<v 10>Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
it,
it would feel weird.</v>

1544
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:33.180
<v 2>Talk talking to him and that Matt Damon Movie,
Man.
What's that?</v>

1545
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:36.220
You're awesome in that Matt Damon Movie Man.
What was it?
Yeah,

1546
01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:39.910
I like the photographer one.
Oh,
that was creepy as fuck.
Yeah,
he's good.

1547
01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.190
Quite one hour or so.
But yeah,

1548
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:45.810
it is weird how they push people aside that they,

1549
01:28:45.970 --> 01:28:48.160
they want the first class people to get off first.

1550
01:28:48.161 --> 01:28:49.040
Like they're made everybody sit up.

1551
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:52.650
<v 10>Yeah.
That was disgusting.
It's disgusting.
And it's also,</v>

1552
01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:56.640
that's how a lot of people have grown accustomed to living every moment of their

1553
01:28:56.641 --> 01:28:59.970
lives.
You realize that the wealthy have,
cause,
you know,

1554
01:28:59.971 --> 01:29:04.620
sometimes I'll go out to a public place with a shit load of people and I'll walk

1555
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:08.040
around.
I'll be like,
man,
I fucking hate being around all these people.
This sucks.

1556
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:11.790
I don't like being in big crowds.
It's annoying.
It feels weird.

1557
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:14.160
And then I'll be like,
you're being negative,
man.
You got to open up more.

1558
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:18.630
You shouldn't let this bother you.
But I think a lot of super wealthy people,

1559
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:20.910
they're like,
they analyze that feeling like,
yeah,

1560
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:22.020
we don't want to be around anyone.

1561
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:27.260
We just want to be around a small groups of people sequestered from society like

1562
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:32.040
us that are like,
yeah,
that's it.
And they've,
uh,
they've,
they've essentially of,

1563
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:37.070
you know how like the Galapagos islands have their own species from being

1564
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:40.960
separated.
Yeah.
I think like super rich people,
they're there.

1565
01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:45.270
They have their own species pop and they have the zone thing happening where

1566
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:49.410
they don't even,
there's,
they're really separated from us.

1567
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:52.980
Like they don't know.
They don't even know about you.

1568
01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:56.340
I bet there's some super wealthy people they don't even fucking know about

1569
01:29:56.341 --> 01:30:00.210
occupy Wall Street.
They don't need,
oh,
that's ridiculous.
I wouldn't be surprised.

1570
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.410
Oh,
come on.
That's impossible.
At this point.
That's absolutely impossible.

1571
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:04.253
It felt like,

1572
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:09.530
to me it felt like there is a gigantic foam separation between like us and them.

1573
01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:15.530
You see the Berkeley Fudge now.
I did

1574
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:20.610
<v 2>cops with Bhutan's just shoving them into the guts of these little kids,</v>

1575
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:25.060
girls too.
Girls shoving these Bhutan's into their sides.

1576
01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:28.030
She's jabbing them over and over.
Then the kids are screaming,

1577
01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:29.770
the kids are in a crowd.
Okay.

1578
01:30:29.771 --> 01:30:32.230
So the kids were in the front of the crowd and they can't even go anywhere.

1579
01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:36.460
It was these people behind them.
So these cops are to push the crowd back.

1580
01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.390
The cops are thrusting their Bhutan's into the unlucky people that are at the

1581
01:30:40.391 --> 01:30:42.730
front of the law and they're little people.
Man,

1582
01:30:42.731 --> 01:30:47.731
a little skinny kids and these cops are fucking Jab Bhutan's.

1583
01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:52.710
<v 10>It's really uncomfortable.
Right.
And you have really got a great story.</v>

1584
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:56.980
<v 2>The thing isn't even a focus.
No,
this isn't that.
That's not it.</v>

1585
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:58.303
It's probably right.

1586
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.960
<v 10>She one of them,
many of footage people,</v>

1587
01:31:02.110 --> 01:31:05.790
they're sticking mic and we'll get them doing that shit.
Yeah,
the poking him.

1588
01:31:05.791 --> 01:31:06.624
This isn't it.

1589
01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:09.340
<v 13>Yeah.
Yeah.
They're hitting them.
Oh Shit,</v>

1590
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:16.080
I haven't seen this one is beating them.

1591
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:21.660
<v 6>Fuck.
Are these people</v>

1592
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.130
we train.

1593
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.630
<v 13>It's so crazy.
This small group of,
it's like a classic,</v>

1594
01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:46.840
the screaming stopped beating students.

1595
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:52.290
This small group of men has to face this gigantic yeah.

1596
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:55.530
<v 2>Board of unarmed people and a small group of men,</v>

1597
01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:00.040
you know the immediately calf to automatically go on the defensive and I look

1598
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.191
<v 4>at them,</v>

1599
01:32:00.191 --> 01:32:04.000
they have bulletproof vests on a fucking helmets and guns strapped to their side

1600
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:06.030
and Bhutan's you know,

1601
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.310
and they all have to rare riot gear with face shields and shit.

1602
01:32:09.311 --> 01:32:12.730
I mean they're coming at you letting you know that they're there to fight.

1603
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.640
You know,
I mean,
look,
this is what it is.
Look,

1604
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:18.430
they're wearing helmets with face shields and shit,
man.

1605
01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:25.830
<v 10>But I liked the guy's shirt.
It's my pink shirt and this guy.
Sure.</v>

1606
01:32:25.831 --> 01:32:28.600
I hate his belt though.
That guy's shirts of baton target.

1607
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.440
You're not calling in the Barbera dude.
Get a real well why are they,

1608
01:32:31.441 --> 01:32:35.040
are they telling them to get off the property or why are they good question.

1609
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:39.120
Yeah.
What are they doing here?
Are they scooping these people off the property?

1610
01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:42.940
I'm the guest.
So the checking them for lice.
Ah Ha.

1611
01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:47.300
<v 4>Um,
I,
you know,
obviously the telling people to stand back and the people look,</v>

1612
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:49.880
you know,
if,
if there's a crowd of people,
the people at the front,

1613
01:32:49.881 --> 01:32:53.290
I'm going to get pushed forward,
man.
Oh Shit.
Oh

1614
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.230
yeah.
This is dark stuff,
man.
Looking really boot to the neck.
Wow.
Fucking bastard.

1615
01:32:59.470 --> 01:33:03.010
He's a,
he's going shin the neck.
That's a shitty control by the way.

1616
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.120
A good way to teach young people down.
Don't teach them Goshen.

1617
01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:12.150
Sean's neck on a normal person that get right up.
Stupid.
Yeah.
Try and tickling.

1618
01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:14.520
Let's just try it.
You're trying to hurt somebody when you go shit neck.

1619
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:18.840
Unless someone else is holding them in the back as mean,

1620
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.270
they're trying to enforce,
you know,

1621
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:24.830
they're trying to like make them feel pain as they're cuffing them.
You know?

1622
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:27.560
<v 10>That's right.
Getting roll found really hard.
They're really rough.</v>

1623
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:29.350
<v 4>Well it's not only that there</v>

1624
01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:32.030
<v 10>did you see him?
He was shy.
He didn't need a shove her like that.</v>

1625
01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:36.180
Who are these guys?
Who are these guys?
What are these guys do afterwards?

1626
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:38.700
<v 4>I don't know.
These are cops man.
Huh.</v>

1627
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:42.240
<v 10>We need to find out who the specifically who these people are and,
and,</v>

1628
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.710
and create special uh,
videos with their names and every,

1629
01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:50.370
and they're bad.
There's already someone needs there.

1630
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:54.450
But there needs to be a website just dedicated to identifying the police at

1631
01:33:54.451 --> 01:33:58.980
these protests who are being violent and pressing charges against them and suing

1632
01:33:58.981 --> 01:34:03.240
them and making it so that it becomes financially are dangerous for the

1633
01:34:03.241 --> 01:34:07.470
individual to act the way that they're acting.
Cause if these cops,

1634
01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:11.550
if we,
if we could just get one of them,
and I'm not saying get one violently,

1635
01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:15.270
obviously I'm saying,
but if we can just get one legally or financially,

1636
01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:19.740
if one of these cops can go down like that and then all of them will start being

1637
01:34:19.741 --> 01:34:23.970
afraid and they won't be so,
uh,
prone to use violence like that,
that should be,

1638
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.830
someone should be taking charge.

1639
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:30.200
<v 4>So this is so surreal to me that this is happening right now.</v>

1640
01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.260
This is what a sign of the times it says,
man,

1641
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:36.580
<v 10>it's like watching an Alex Jones dream or sound is watching.</v>

1642
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:40.180
This is like the Shitty was talking about,
oh,
he's right.
This is what he's been,

1643
01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.410
<v 4>what I always say about Alex Jones,
he's right 70% of the time,</v>

1644
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.750
70% of the time he's right.

1645
01:34:45.751 --> 01:34:49.980
This is a 30% of the crazy stuff that he's kind of makes up that I wouldn't even

1646
01:34:49.981 --> 01:34:54.150
say mixed up,
but he,
he just,
he gets,
he goes a little too deep on certain,

1647
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.110
<v 10>these police are,
I don't know,
because I mean,
who knows?</v>

1648
01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:01.490
It's hard for me to believe that they're thinking about the new world order or

1649
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:01.880
protection.

1650
01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.150
<v 4>Then globalization.
Yeah.
It feels like they're just normal guys who are doing,</v>

1651
01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:06.830
that's a terrible position to be in.
I mean,

1652
01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:09.380
imagine if you were a cop and all of a sudden they tell you this is what you

1653
01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:11.960
have to do it.
You have to get the hippies off the lawn.
Uh,
sir,

1654
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:15.350
there's 300,000 of them.
What are you going to do?

1655
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:17.450
How are you going to get them off the lawn?
Good luck,
man.

1656
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.050
You mean what are you supposed to do?
We will.
I,

1657
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:22.730
the mayor has ordered you to clear the lawn so it must clear the lawn.

1658
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.580
You can't clear that law and man,
what if you're a cop?

1659
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:27.350
What the fuck are you going to do?
You know,

1660
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:31.940
the cops are obviously being sent there to keep these people from protesting or

1661
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:36.110
push them off of certain areas or keep thing from entering certain places,

1662
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:40.640
but at the end of the day,
you know,
they're stuck there.
There.
There's,

1663
01:35:40.641 --> 01:35:43.910
there's no excuse for what they're doing and there's no excuse for beating those

1664
01:35:43.911 --> 01:35:45.830
people.
There's no excuse for prodding those people.

1665
01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.070
They should get absolutely not be cops because they can't handle that.

1666
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:52.400
If they're doing that.
You don't have to hit someone who's not hitting you,
man.

1667
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:54.850
No one knows.
People were hitting back.
That's theirs.

1668
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:57.400
It wasn't like they were in danger and they had to protect themselves.

1669
01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.700
They were ragdoll on people.

1670
01:35:58.701 --> 01:36:03.500
Man needs to be a public shaming of those guys.
Those guys.

1671
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:07.400
There needs to be,
you know how I know it's also,
here's the other part though,

1672
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:10.940
the fucking with the occupy movement.
All right.

1673
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:14.540
There's a lot of shenanigans going on.
A lot of it is just nuts.

1674
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:18.470
It's not all a bunch of people with valid points that are out there trying to

1675
01:36:18.471 --> 01:36:23.060
resolve the issues that we currently have a lot of is just a crazy assholes,

1676
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:26.510
you know?
I mean,
it's not all activists at these fucking things.

1677
01:36:26.511 --> 01:36:28.670
These things are magnets for chaos.

1678
01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:33.671
They're magnets for various like constant patterns of behavior in humanity that

1679
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.800
by now stereo typical patterns of behavior like hippies,
thugs,

1680
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:46.440
drug dealers,
chaos.
There's homeless people.
There's a,

1681
01:36:46.441 --> 01:36:47.900
there's a lot going on.

1682
01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:52.820
I mean it's a community of people that have taken to occupying giant chunks.

1683
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:53.520
All Dude,

1684
01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.080
they showed occupy everywhere was a poster that someone put up online on the

1685
01:36:57.081 --> 01:37:00.620
message board and I looked at it and showed all the different places where

1686
01:37:00.621 --> 01:37:05.050
people are protesting like,
what the fuck man?
That's when it really hit.
When you,

1687
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:08.210
there's a photo,
it says occupy everywhere.
See if you could find that dude.

1688
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:13.300
There's occupy us and occupy everywhere and the photos are fucking rippy dude.

1689
01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:17.950
When you look at all the different protests you like ever,

1690
01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.660
or has it been like this before,
right?
That's right.
Never.

1691
01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:24.130
It's never been like this before.
Right?
This is incredible.
Yeah.

1692
01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:28.820
This is a strange,
strange time and it snuck up on us.

1693
01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.260
It was so quick.

1694
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:34.280
All of a sudden there's protests are everywhere and it really makes you take

1695
01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:37.250
into consideration like where's the,
where's the end point?

1696
01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.560
<v 10>They can't win.
You know that Martin Luther,
he can't win the fucking pigs.</v>

1697
01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:46.680
<v 4>Doug [inaudible] talking about the happy shades.</v>

1698
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:48.850
Higgs man,
that's

1699
01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:49.571
<v 10>the best word.</v>

1700
01:37:49.571 --> 01:37:54.571
When you see some fucking fatty with a baton poke in a 17 year old girl,

1701
01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.570
there no better description for that man.

1702
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:02.100
Then pig oinker piggy.
That's what that guy is.

1703
01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:06.030
He's a fucking disgusting fucking pig.

1704
01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:11.150
A useless cowardly human who has been hired by evil people to push down the

1705
01:38:12.481 --> 01:38:15.810
force of evolution in the universe.
And if you try to stop evolution,

1706
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.793
you're fucked.

1707
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.590
I don't know what's going to happen to that pig or the people I can,

1708
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.640
but it's not going to be great.
That's,
you can't hold it back.
What's happening?

1709
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:24.640
It won't work.

1710
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.410
<v 5>I think as soon as you turn cops loose on people,</v>

1711
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:32.590
cops are used to dealing with the enemy.

1712
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.660
They're used to dealing with criminals.

1713
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:38.620
They're used to behaving a certain way because out in their world,

1714
01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:41.530
they have to behave that way.
If you want to stay alive as a cop,

1715
01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:44.770
you gotta take no bullshit from any fucking purpose.
You've got to,
you know,

1716
01:38:44.771 --> 01:38:46.840
you got to arrest people.
You've got to deal with dangerous,

1717
01:38:46.841 --> 01:38:49.150
violent criminals that don't want to go to jail and know that you want to put

1718
01:38:49.151 --> 01:38:51.920
them in jail.
It's a fucking high pressure,
high stress job.

1719
01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.800
The person to blame is not those cops.
It sounds like they should be to blame,

1720
01:38:56.801 --> 01:39:01.360
but the person that blame is the person who put those cops in a position where

1721
01:39:01.361 --> 01:39:04.510
they're going after law abiding citizens.
That's the problem.

1722
01:39:04.511 --> 01:39:08.140
Because then even though those people technically are committing any crimes

1723
01:39:08.141 --> 01:39:09.670
other than loitering,
I mean what are they doing?

1724
01:39:09.671 --> 01:39:13.210
I mean isn't there a right to protest?
But I mean who knows what the latest,

1725
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.560
<v 10>I think it's the property though.
Profit.
It's just,
you know,</v>

1726
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.390
they're ruining the lines.
But here's the thing,
can I just,
I just want to say,

1727
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:23.640
cause it couldn't be what I said,
it could be misconstrued.

1728
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:26.130
I'm not saying all cops are probably,
no you're not.
Okay then I want,

1729
01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.360
of course they're talking married.

1730
01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.480
<v 5>What I'm saying is cops are wired to deal with criminals.
I mean,</v>

1731
01:39:32.481 --> 01:39:35.750
they try to work with people all day,
but you gotta be on Edge,
man.

1732
01:39:35.751 --> 01:39:37.160
You've got to be on edge all the time.

1733
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:42.310
And when some asshole tells these cops now you have to go and you have to push

1734
01:39:42.861 --> 01:39:45.560
back these crowds of unhappy,

1735
01:39:45.561 --> 01:39:48.320
intelligent people who are nonviolent.

1736
01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.460
And these people are very valid points about the corruption that is a road at

1737
01:39:52.461 --> 01:39:53.211
our system too.

1738
01:39:53.211 --> 01:39:57.650
It almost unfixable point and were fucking upset because they're in college and

1739
01:39:57.651 --> 01:40:01.370
where the fuck is their future?
Yeah.
Can't have ruined the whole batch.

1740
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.660
There's nothing left for us.

1741
01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.870
We're growing up and were coming out and there's nothing left for us.

1742
01:40:05.871 --> 01:40:09.410
You fuck heads,
you've ruined the whole thing and you're a cop man,

1743
01:40:09.411 --> 01:40:12.350
and you are the enemy.
You will represent the man.

1744
01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:16.010
They treat you hostily you treat them Hossley.
They don't listen to you.

1745
01:40:16.011 --> 01:40:18.080
You treat them like criminals.
That's how you're wired.

1746
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.960
You're wired to treat criminals like criminals.
Yeah.

1747
01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:25.250
They all of a sudden these young kids who are very valid points become
criminals,

1748
01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:27.740
but it's awesome because there's a lot of douchebags in those groups.

1749
01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.840
Those groups.
It never pure,
you know?

1750
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:33.950
<v 10>Well,
no.
And also those groups,
by the way,
and the whole fucking problem with the,</v>

1751
01:40:33.951 --> 01:40:34.341
uh,

1752
01:40:34.341 --> 01:40:38.900
the current formation of this protest movement or this revolution are right now

1753
01:40:38.901 --> 01:40:42.200
is that it's,
it's so loosely,
uh,
what's the problem?
It's,

1754
01:40:42.201 --> 01:40:46.670
what's awesome about it is that it's a modular and it seems to be,
you know,

1755
01:40:46.671 --> 01:40:49.520
broken up in all these groups that have come together into this one thing,

1756
01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:54.160
but there is no easier group to infiltrate than a group like that.

1757
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.290
<v 2>So by now,
the CIA,
they there,
they must have infiltrated the,</v>

1758
01:40:58.291 --> 01:41:01.360
they've got people there,
they're like,
they're studying like,
okay,

1759
01:41:01.361 --> 01:41:05.060
what's the best way to handle this?
How can we implement this,

1760
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.430
break this up or make it so you guys are fuck guys.
Girlfriends.
Yeah,

1761
01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.670
I'd stick.
Fuck your girlfriend.
CIA guys just going to get,

1762
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.291
they're going to give him my,

1763
01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:21.010
I grow and get these chicks high and just fuck the shit out of them.
Yeah.

1764
01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:23.080
These girls,
they never been with a real man.

1765
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:24.520
They're hanging out with all these hips.
Oh wait.

1766
01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:27.880
So you think CIA fuck agents have infiltrated occupy Wall Street,

1767
01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.740
that porn movie.

1768
01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.490
That's the movie then that is the movie.

1769
01:41:34.491 --> 01:41:39.160
CIA porn operatives,
Cia,
Dick,
sling and experts.

1770
01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:42.250
Like they show up at gang bangs.
Mr. Johnson come with me.

1771
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:43.990
You're government needs you.
And he said,
man,

1772
01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:47.350
I'm in the middle of fucking all these bitches and this guy's just banging these

1773
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:49.360
bitches left and right.
And that's what they do.

1774
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:51.310
They sell them as a group of them in one of the guys,

1775
01:41:51.311 --> 01:41:55.990
they got to pull out a retirement.
They're like,
I can't fuck again.

1776
01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:01.450
My soul out in Vietnam.
I'm not going.
We need you.

1777
01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:03.070
You've got to come.

1778
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.880
These hippie girls have got to be fucking hippie girls with not getting good

1779
01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:10.600
dick ever.
These guys are eating nothing but granola and hemp seeds and shit.

1780
01:42:10.601 --> 01:42:11.920
And they smell.
They just,

1781
01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:14.710
no one's just grammar these fucking the shit out of him.

1782
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:18.550
And that's what the CIA guys do.
These,
these poor guys,
they send them in,

1783
01:42:18.670 --> 01:42:21.730
they start fucking all these girls.
It will creates turmoil.

1784
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:26.580
It's a special division.
It's like the 18 and they had their be fuckers.
Yeah.

1785
01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.320
They call themselves the Hippie fucker.
Yeah,
they've been doing,

1786
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:32.800
if there's boot camps where they still imagine that would work,
man.

1787
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:36.100
On a lot of these unfucking balanced people that would work.

1788
01:42:36.101 --> 01:42:37.990
Fuck them into submission.
Send,

1789
01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:42.280
send a bunch of guys to just go in there and fuck everyone,
man.

1790
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.690
Well I guess going to hire like Brad Pitt looking dudes.
Yeah,

1791
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.150
just have them just run through the ranks,
get in with them,

1792
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:52.480
get tight with them and then just start banging dude's wives.
That's your job.

1793
01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:55.120
And then like be real sloppy about it,
you know,

1794
01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.310
to say that you want to be dangerous but get caught,

1795
01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:01.360
get caught left and right all the time.
All the time.
Everybody gets caught.

1796
01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:06.220
Everybody gets called [inaudible] slow to leave loads all of the bed you pull

1797
01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:09.250
out on Tom Purpose and shoot your load.
Every park cushion,

1798
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.870
you know the guy sits down and looks at it.
He's like,
this is a fucking load.

1799
01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:18.640
You've been fucked by the CIA.
CIA has infiltrated our tents so they have like,

1800
01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:23.570
they actually can come in a pattern that indicates they were there.
Yeah,

1801
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:24.641
that's what they do.

1802
01:43:24.641 --> 01:43:28.360
They come on you and then they let it slowly congeal and then they put a seal on

1803
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:32.980
it.
So they brand you.
I gotta use the bathroom.
Go use the bathroom,
man.

1804
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:36.940
Don't hold it in Jesus Christ.
You know where it is in our powerful new desk.

1805
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:40.390
Quad studios do two,
two,
two.
So Brian,

1806
01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.970
<v 4>do you know anything about you don't know anything about this football case.
Dot.</v>

1807
01:43:44.971 --> 01:43:47.240
Can we go on?
So over there you don't know where you're going.

1808
01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:52.040
Fucking guy gets lost in a room with two

1809
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.560
<v 2>doors.
I know he tried that already.</v>

1810
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:58.230
Do you need know anything about this football case?
Uh,

1811
01:43:58.231 --> 01:44:01.340
now we talked about it or on one of the podcasts earlier,
but I it,

1812
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:06.460
it seems like one guy who was caught up to 40 different people that he's fucked

1813
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.090
again,
showers and stuff.

1814
01:44:08.091 --> 01:44:11.180
And he was a assistant football coach and Dusky and he apparently,

1815
01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:14.030
it's like a famous guy.
I don't know anything about the world of football,

1816
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:16.820
but I've heard the name Joe Paterno.
Yeah,
I've heard the name.

1817
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:22.130
And then I guess a Ashton Kutcher,
uh,
came on Twitter and said something like,

1818
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.230
I can't believe they fired him or something like that.

1819
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:29.231
Like he was defending the guy and then somebody said that he now he asked him,

1820
01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:34.100
gave,
is his Twitter account to somebody else to do for now on,

1821
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:38.820
because it's just too many feedback from what he said or so someone else's

1822
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:40.030
handling his Twitter

1823
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:42.740
<v 4>that says he complained that the fire,</v>

1824
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:46.830
the guy who covered up a fucking assistant coach was banging kids.

1825
01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:51.180
Let me tell you something,
man.
If a guy's bang and kids,
you kind of know,
right?

1826
01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:52.800
I don't think you don't know,

1827
01:44:52.801 --> 01:44:56.800
especially for 40 accurate guys taking kids on the road with him.
Right.

1828
01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.190
He took kids on the road and put them up in hotels,

1829
01:44:59.191 --> 01:45:03.450
bought them presence and shit.
You know,
and not only that,

1830
01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.480
there was a story that the da who was investigating the case disappeared in 2005

1831
01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.950
so,
you know,
they had to fire a man.

1832
01:45:13.951 --> 01:45:16.230
This could be some crazy cover up murder shit.

1833
01:45:16.231 --> 01:45:19.860
We don't even know what the fuck happened yet.
This guy was like a loved guy.

1834
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:23.490
I mean,
this is a huge,
huge scandal.
Apparently.
You know,

1835
01:45:23.491 --> 01:45:26.590
I talked to people that were,
what does it,
Penn state,
is that what it is?
Yep.

1836
01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.300
Nittany lions.
Is that what they call themselves?
I don't even know him.
I'm sorry.

1837
01:45:30.301 --> 01:45:33.330
People like you don't know shit about football.
You fucking push.
Hey,

1838
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:38.130
<v 2>here's the mountains.
Here's what a missing guy.
I listened.
Desky guy.</v>

1839
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:42.800
<v 4>Yeah,
he's a missing Da.
The district attorney,
he went missing in 2005,</v>

1840
01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:45.340
eight fucking probably ice.
This guy,
man,

1841
01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.450
you know when you're dealing with a case this big,

1842
01:45:48.570 --> 01:45:52.880
apparently what happened was a grad student went into a shower,

1843
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:57.910
went back to retrieve something and he heard noises in the shower that were

1844
01:45:58.771 --> 01:46:00.120
like,
like steady,

1845
01:46:00.121 --> 01:46:04.070
rhythmic slapping noise is went in and saw this guy fucking an eight,

1846
01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:06.570
a 10 year old boy in the ass in the shower.

1847
01:46:07.290 --> 01:46:12.290
And they are also investigators have him on the phone with one of the boys,

1848
01:46:12.331 --> 01:46:13.164
mothers.

1849
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:18.230
And the boy's mother asks him if he touched the boy in an inappropriate place,

1850
01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:25.470
in an inappropriate manner.
And he goes,
uh,
maybe,

1851
01:46:26.190 --> 01:46:30.990
maybe he said maybe.
Yeah.
It was like,
yeah.
Um,
I don't know.
Maybe.

1852
01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:31.913
Maybe I did.

1853
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.480
You maybe you did like it when you're that crazy,

1854
01:46:36.570 --> 01:46:40.410
you're that pedal.
They were protecting a pedo man.
That's,

1855
01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.510
that's all this is because they don't want to run the football.

1856
01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.680
They were crazy straight up protecting a pedo.
There's no question about it.

1857
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.010
There's no question about it,
man.
You know that

1858
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.270
<v 2>this is no way you can hide that darkness,
man.
That's as dark as it gets.</v>

1859
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:57.060
Your fucking little boys in her little assholes.

1860
01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:01.890
You're going to hide that 10 year old boys,
not even a man.
You know,
it's not,

1861
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:05.070
it's not like you're tricking men and,
uh,
in your bank and you know,

1862
01:47:05.071 --> 01:47:08.640
pour straight man.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You're,
you're banging a little bit boys.

1863
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.110
You're appeasers Shit,
man.
Worse than your worst than the worst kind of demon.

1864
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:14.160
Yeah.
How does,
how does,

1865
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:17.940
how is it possible that that guy can just be interacting with everyone else and

1866
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:20.010
they're not going to know that no one's going to weird out.

1867
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:22.860
You're all going on the road together and know there's a Mr Sandusky.

1868
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.560
What is his fucking 10 year old buddy?
You'd be like,

1869
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:28.200
what are you doing with this 10 year old boy?
Is this your son?

1870
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:30.660
If that was your son,
that's one thing.
Well he's close to his kid.

1871
01:47:30.661 --> 01:47:32.880
He likes to take his kid with him when he goes to football games.

1872
01:47:33.050 --> 01:47:36.330
Little boy loves football.
Yeah.
Okay,
that's great.
That's a great dad.

1873
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:40.380
But if you're a guy and he's just taking some 10 year old around with you and

1874
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:44.040
he's always got new presence and shit.
How does everybody not look at that?

1875
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:46.440
How does everybody not go?
What the fuck is going on with this guy?

1876
01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.470
There's something,
there has to be some weird interaction between them.

1877
01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:52.980
There has to be something that treats you that there has to be when a little a

1878
01:47:52.981 --> 01:47:55.830
boy's getting fucked by some old man you don't,

1879
01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:59.640
you don't just sneak that through.
It was a 10 year old boy.
I Dunno,

1880
01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:04.450
he's always near me.
Where kid.
No,
but there's like,
you know,
in families,
kids,

1881
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.510
people who have been molested.
It was like pre,

1882
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.810
they would pretend that it was a happening.

1883
01:48:09.811 --> 01:48:11.580
The family would kind of pretend it wasn't there,

1884
01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:14.850
but they all know it's kind of there but nobody wants to deal with it cause it's

1885
01:48:14.851 --> 01:48:15.960
so fucked up.

1886
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:21.470
I know a girl who was molested by her uncle and her family attacked her and her

1887
01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:24.390
sister and her cousins who are all molested by the same guy.

1888
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.040
Her family all attack them and said that there were all lying and they're like,

1889
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:31.050
whoa.
Like this guy molested them for years,

1890
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:35.010
for years and nobody would believe it.
That's it.
It's amazing.
They were,

1891
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.640
what if they go and ask the family on the list of the uncle and that was like

1892
01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:42.870
their little gangs and they're just trying to cover their evil 10 year old

1893
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:47.430
demons going out to the uncles.
Yeah.
You read that book,

1894
01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:50.950
Lolita?
No,
it's really good.
I said

1895
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:55.440
no,
it's what gave birth to that term.

1896
01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.380
I know it's really bizarre man.
The arbitrary age of 18 when one,

1897
01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.610
when one becomes legal,

1898
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.120
because there was a thread on the message board recently where some attractive

1899
01:49:06.121 --> 01:49:09.450
young lass has just become 18 and there was a celebration.

1900
01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:13.980
So it was all these photos of this a well endowed little hooker and I shouldn't

1901
01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:16.410
call her hooker.
She's probably a nice girl.
Well endowed little night.

1902
01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:18.270
When I say hooker I call my friends hookers.
Yeah,

1903
01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.840
like I'll call it Dunkin Hooker.
I don't mean in a bad way just to clarify,

1904
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.140
but as well endowed nice young lady and they're all talking about fucking the

1905
01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:26.880
shit out of her.
And I'm like,
man that's dark.

1906
01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.490
She was just a little baby like a couple of weeks ago,

1907
01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.570
like a couple of weeks ago,

1908
01:49:30.571 --> 01:49:34.730
she was 17 and now she's 18 and you guys all want to shove your rods inside of

1909
01:49:34.731 --> 01:49:39.390
her.
Like that's dark man,
isn't it?
It's Kinda dark.
There's something,

1910
01:49:39.391 --> 01:49:43.680
but it's fucking totally legal.
You know this one guy was like,

1911
01:49:43.681 --> 01:49:45.650
I'd like to see or dirty condor solved over.

1912
01:49:45.651 --> 01:49:47.950
You're saying some like really Ruthie Shit cunt.

1913
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:50.140
<v 4>I'll fuck the shit out of this dirty con.</v>

1914
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:54.480
Something along those lines and it made me laugh because it was ridiculous cause

1915
01:49:54.481 --> 01:49:56.620
it was so over the top.
But then I thought about,
I'm like,

1916
01:49:56.621 --> 01:50:00.080
it's kind of creepy that you can say this about an 18 year old where you cannot

1917
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:01.760
say that about a 16 year old Europe

1918
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:04.630
<v 3>piece of Shit,
man.
Yeah.
What about states that are even younger?</v>

1919
01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:08.760
Like 15 and stuff,
right?
Like other 14 before and that's crazy.
Yeah.

1920
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:11.710
Well you know,
I think,
I don't think it's uniform all across the country.

1921
01:50:11.711 --> 01:50:14.950
I think Nevada where that fucking dude,
that 51 year old dude got

1922
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.960
married.
Damn he's neighbor Sam Tripoli's name,

1923
01:50:18.961 --> 01:50:20.890
but we didn't get to talk about it on Sandra.
Forgot.

1924
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:25.490
We forgot to talk about neighbors as Courtney Stotten a we'll talk about it on

1925
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:27.380
tonight.
Spark Cassandra please.

1926
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:31.140
<v 4>Oh,
beautiful.
Yeah.
We're going to do another podcast tonight,
folks.</v>

1927
01:50:31.141 --> 01:50:35.760
This is how fucking wild we are.
We're doing a podcast was Dunkin were Dunkin.

1928
01:50:35.761 --> 01:50:39.360
Okay.
Talk.
We're doing a podcast with Dunkin.
And then when we're done with this,

1929
01:50:39.361 --> 01:50:40.440
we've got a show tonight,

1930
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:45.030
a sold out show at the Ice House in Pasadena on stage to the intimate venue.

1931
01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:48.150
And so we're going to do that afterwards and we're all going to come back here

1932
01:50:48.151 --> 01:50:51.430
and do podcasts in between our sets.
So it's uh,

1933
01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.230
this fucking new room is key.
This is awesome.

1934
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:58.120
It's such a sweet set up.
It's at the Ice House.

1935
01:50:58.290 --> 01:51:00.990
So we're going to be doing a lot more podcasts from here.

1936
01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.340
But what were we just talking about?

1937
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.200
<v 3>We're talking about fucking Courtney style.
Yeah.
And she's,</v>

1938
01:51:05.201 --> 01:51:08.200
she's Tripoli's neighbor man.
Well let triply talk about it again today.

1939
01:51:08.230 --> 01:51:12.460
It's a teaser,
ladies and gentleman.
But in the meantime,
before it,

1940
01:51:12.461 --> 01:51:17.380
before Tripoli comes on,
immediately follow Courtney Stotten on Twitter,

1941
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:21.610
then let the triple he fill in the rest of the batch or Twitter's ridiculous.

1942
01:51:21.611 --> 01:51:23.440
And she's 16 going on 40.

1943
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:27.970
She looks like a 38 year old ladies here on doc herself.
Dr Drew,

1944
01:51:27.971 --> 01:51:30.880
I had her on there just to see it cause everyone says her boobs are fake.
Right?

1945
01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:33.810
So they had this doctor come in there and they made this whole like episode with

1946
01:51:33.811 --> 01:51:38.020
like trying to figure out if it's boobs are real and like the doctors had a hard

1947
01:51:38.021 --> 01:51:39.820
time like I can't see through this muscle.

1948
01:51:39.821 --> 01:51:43.510
It's like they really built it up even the whole time.

1949
01:51:43.511 --> 01:51:46.420
They're just feeling her tits and she just didn't exist so crazy.

1950
01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:51.420
They're feeling 16 year and Mexican guys where that was such a repress culture.

1951
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:56.020
We're such as sexually repressed culture that this kind of shit is what we

1952
01:51:56.021 --> 01:52:00.220
fixate on.
This is why we fixate on this is a real thing.
Oh yes.
Bring her in.

1953
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.980
Bringing the sluts so we can test her breasts.
Well,

1954
01:52:02.981 --> 01:52:04.420
it's not like they don't like each other.

1955
01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.150
They obviously enjoy each other's company.
The hang around together.

1956
01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.960
I mean it was just,
you're not supposed to be banging a 16 year old dude.
No.

1957
01:52:10.961 --> 01:52:15.070
And check this out.
The,
I guess the photographer of a lot of her photos,

1958
01:52:15.071 --> 01:52:18.450
her sexy photos,
like where she is with her,
her boyfriend or husband,

1959
01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:22.870
whatever are actually taken by her mom.
Mom.
Yeah.

1960
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.840
Did you ever see there was like a one of those 2020 type shows and it was all on

1961
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:35.890
this porn star whose parents support her work?

1962
01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:39.180
What?
What was her name?
I'm trying to remember it that it's the one that uh,

1963
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:43.960
that bunny ranch guy used to hang out with.
It's not sunny.
Is it?

1964
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:45.890
Low noise.

1965
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.870
<v 10>So on the wane Sunnyville Wayne,
sunny,</v>

1966
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:54.130
Sunny Leone sending you Leone,
is that it?
No,
I don't think that is,
isn't it hurt?

1967
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.190
I think that's a different girl.
I think that's a different girl.

1968
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:59.180
I think it's really fucking weird.
And that's a dark haired girl,
I think.

1969
01:52:59.410 --> 01:53:01.160
Don't you think it's really fucking weird?
And,
and I,

1970
01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:06.080
and I think it's like obviously completely fucked up to like,

1971
01:53:06.190 --> 01:53:10.580
uh,
fuck people under 18.
But in general,

1972
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:14.360
don't you think that outside of that,
which I think is like sociologically,

1973
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:18.080
it's super fucked up and it clearly fucks people's lives up and people would do,

1974
01:53:18.081 --> 01:53:21.110
it should be thrown alligators.
But in general,

1975
01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:25.490
isn't it strange that for adults,
sex,

1976
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.170
the terms used to describe sex,
dirty,
naughty,

1977
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:31.340
filthy.

1978
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:36.140
It's like we attached to the act of bringing life into the universe or

1979
01:53:36.141 --> 01:53:37.970
simulating bringing life into the universe.

1980
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:42.980
We attached to that so many adjectives that are just like,
it's disgusting.

1981
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.520
Smut,
filth.
That's what,
when you look at porn,

1982
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.980
that's like the words they use to sell porn,

1983
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:53.080
the dirtiest smmody as filthiest whores,
this side.
It's like,
yeah.

1984
01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.980
It's so strange that

1985
01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.130
<v 4>because of obviously,</v>

1986
01:53:57.131 --> 01:54:01.840
because in order to have an industrial revolution in order to,
you know,
have a,

1987
01:54:01.841 --> 01:54:03.400
the society that we currently enjoy,

1988
01:54:03.401 --> 01:54:06.640
people who have to work and if people would just dirty fucking all day,

1989
01:54:06.641 --> 01:54:08.650
they would complicate shit.
Nothing would ever get done.

1990
01:54:08.651 --> 01:54:11.980
We have an ethic and one of the ethics is you keep your fucking sexuality to

1991
01:54:11.981 --> 01:54:14.160
yourself all day long.
Very weird.

1992
01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:17.200
Mr. Herman Cain with your fucking unwanted massages.

1993
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.820
<v 10>Fucking,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
it's so fucking strange,
man.
It's like,
yeah,
it's,</v>

1994
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:22.050
you were telling me about how you were in,

1995
01:54:22.090 --> 01:54:25.380
what did you say you were in Germany and you watch like a gang bang on regular

1996
01:54:25.381 --> 01:54:26.214
TV.

1997
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:29.140
<v 4>They didn't show penetration,
but this dude was banging.</v>

1998
01:54:29.141 --> 01:54:31.020
This chick from behind her tits are flopping around.

1999
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.790
There was other people behind them.
They were fucking,
yeah.
It was like,

2000
01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.520
it was almost like some software

2001
01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.420
<v 10>core sort of a thing.
But what you said about Hartman at this strip club,</v>

2002
01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.310
that's,
to me that's like,
that's how it should be.
It should be joyful.

2003
01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.040
It converts.
It's like it's the fact that it's not,

2004
01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:52.710
is an indication of how like backwards and repress we are.
Yeah.
I mean,

2005
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:56.740
by the way,
you know,
filthy dirty things are awesome.

2006
01:54:56.741 --> 01:54:59.740
I'm not saying that that doesn't add to like the excitement of it,

2007
01:54:59.741 --> 01:55:03.160
but it seems like in,
in our culture it's so,

2008
01:55:03.490 --> 01:55:06.460
it's so like fucking scarlet letter,

2009
01:55:06.461 --> 01:55:11.461
Nathaniel Hawthorne style humiliation of people who really aren't doing anything

2010
01:55:11.861 --> 01:55:16.140
that bad compared to what other people in the world,
they're doing it right.

2011
01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:20.500
You know,
like it's,
it's a,
it's a lot worse for,
you know,

2012
01:55:20.530 --> 01:55:21.520
we probably talked about this

2013
01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:26.340
<v 4>because we,
we have the instinct to fuck more than his mesentery.
We,
we,</v>

2014
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:30.190
we have the instinct to fuck like we needed to fuck 10,000 years ago and half

2015
01:55:30.191 --> 01:55:34.450
the babies were eaten by crocodiles.
You know,
we have this,
this drive,

2016
01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:37.060
as long as the man is alive,
as long as the man,

2017
01:55:37.061 --> 01:55:40.990
his breathing healthy and Phil and robust,
they want to fuck,

2018
01:55:40.991 --> 01:55:43.770
they want to shoot loads and the people and create more.
And it's just,

2019
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.500
it's just the desire to breathe.
That's all it is.

2020
01:55:46.501 --> 01:55:50.450
The desire to breed manifest itself in a code that's in,

2021
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:53.970
that runs your body.
And as long as that code runs your body,

2022
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:57.400
people are gonna want to fuck.
And if that's going to be the case,
people go,

2023
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.850
there's no way going to get anything done because people were just going to be

2024
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:02.130
trying to fuck each other all day.
Cause that's what they wanna do.

2025
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:06.570
So you have to figure out a way to suppress them and control them and to calm

2026
01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:10.920
them down.
Peto bear cuddle,
bear approval.
You,
you know,

2027
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:14.700
to calm them down to the point where you know,
things get done.

2028
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.660
So you have to tell them it's naughty,
it's dirty topic.
Just to put it away,

2029
01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.160
put her away.
You got to shame him.

2030
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:22.480
It's the only way they feel bad about pulling it out.
Oh,

2031
01:56:22.481 --> 01:56:24.680
I don't want to fuck her,
but I can't heal.

2032
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:27.030
You go in the bathroom and taking the other girl you're working with

2033
01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:32.130
because you have this massive suppression during the day of your natural

2034
01:56:32.131 --> 01:56:34.440
instincts and feelings.
You can express them.

2035
01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.100
Didn't Mckenna talk about some primordial like World War II?
There were my,

2036
01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:40.830
sure more Jesus like this.
People can buy shrimp.

2037
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:44.610
Utopian view of the past was that there was a,
at one point in time,

2038
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:49.730
society had engaged in like almost daily mushroom use and that's what an

2039
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:54.780
elevated us from the lower hominids and that was the whole stoned ape theory.

2040
01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:58.290
He believes that psychedelic mushrooms and the eating of them was responsible

2041
01:56:58.291 --> 01:57:02.070
for the doubling of the human brain size over affiliate period of 2 million

2042
01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.440
years.
Huge,
huge mystery in the fossil record.

2043
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:08.700
So he had a lot of like a really nutty theories like that.
But you know,

2044
01:57:08.701 --> 01:57:13.270
they're very interesting to consider.
But I don't know,
given an orgy.
No,
no.

2045
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.840
Never ever been an orgy.
Brian,
just two girls.

2046
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:20.610
I will foul.
I've never been in,
Hello Columbus,
Ohio.

2047
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.030
I know.
I know people who've been to orgies.

2048
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.310
I was at a party that I know a girl worked at a place where they would have

2049
01:57:26.311 --> 01:57:31.020
orgies.
She worked as a cocktail waitress at this place where they would go.

2050
01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:33.420
People would go and then they would just start fucking,

2051
01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:36.960
they would just meet up and go into rooms and fucking everywhere she went.

2052
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:38.850
She like,
people were just fucking everywhere you went,

2053
01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:41.400
you got there and they weren't pretty,
they weren't good looking people,

2054
01:57:41.401 --> 01:57:46.020
but they were just all of them like naked,
half naked,
somewhere dressed.
Some,

2055
01:57:46.021 --> 01:57:46.920
some didn't participate.

2056
01:57:46.921 --> 01:57:50.340
They just watched and there was like a club in La and people would go and just

2057
01:57:50.341 --> 01:57:54.000
fuck.
Yeah,
it was crazy.
She was like laughing at it.
She's like,

2058
01:57:54.001 --> 01:57:56.280
it is the weirdest job.
She goes,
after a couple of hours,

2059
01:57:56.281 --> 01:57:58.890
I got used to the fact that people were just all around and fucking all the time

2060
01:57:58.891 --> 01:58:01.710
and nobody bothered me.
She's like this.
The one thing that happens,

2061
01:58:01.711 --> 01:58:03.300
you know when everyone else is fucking,

2062
01:58:03.301 --> 01:58:04.680
and someone who wants to serve you drinks,

2063
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:07.440
he barely even concentrate on that person.
You're like,
Yay,
here's your money.

2064
01:58:07.441 --> 01:58:09.900
Thank you.
Bye.
I'm gonna go fuck somebody wants to fuck me.

2065
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:13.440
So it was like much safer actually than working at a bar where you were looked

2066
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:15.700
at as like,
oh look at this girl.
Come in with,

2067
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:21.480
what are you going after?
Who Do you do what you live with me.
You know those,

2068
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:23.400
those guys didn't even look at her.

2069
01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.740
Cause there's all these people that were fucking in front of them.

2070
01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:29.010
Everyone was sucking cock and everyone,
you could bang anybody,
you know.

2071
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:30.990
So there's a probably a few contrarians.

2072
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.760
They're like turn their gaze towards her.

2073
01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:35.670
Like fuck all these people that are banging each other.
What about this girl?

2074
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:39.450
How she feels about this?
And they always get to have that one.
The one girl,

2075
01:58:39.451 --> 01:58:42.100
he doesn't want to fuck it.
Who you fall in love

2076
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.280
<v 2>with.
Just some dudes that are just broken.
There's some dudes that are broken.</v>

2077
01:58:45.281 --> 01:58:49.050
They always go for the girl that's going to just be damaged goods and always

2078
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:53.260
going to need,
need to be with the person who can't be with them.
Yeah.

2079
01:58:53.261 --> 01:58:56.530
It's always the case.
We need the grand distraction,

2080
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.570
the grand distraction of relationships.

2081
01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.260
You know I'm ever imagined when you were young.
I remember when you were young,

2082
01:59:02.261 --> 01:59:04.090
rather imagine if you felt like that now,

2083
01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:06.880
like when you were young and you'd break up,
you really would think like,
God,

2084
01:59:06.881 --> 01:59:10.630
this is the end.
I can never,
I can never be happy in a relationship again.

2085
01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:12.550
You used to believe that.
Yeah,
sure.

2086
01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.940
<v 3>14 how many songs are about that?</v>

2087
01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:19.890
There's the catalyst songs that that's the main message is that it's over.

2088
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:24.990
I have no earthly songs like begging for one more night.
Yeah.

2089
01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:29.220
Yeah.
Give me just one.

2090
01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.190
<v 2>It's so gross.</v>

2091
01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:36.980
So Beta and so bait.

2092
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:41.380
Don't you got a Rolodex Homie?
Don't you got other girls you can call them.

2093
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:44.570
This is some planet of the ape shit son.
Let me just give you a little heads up.

2094
01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:46.700
You need to go to the gym and do some squats,

2095
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:51.310
eat some bison meat and get your shit together son and get some,

2096
01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:56.270
get some street stopped doing that.
Brian,
get some strong game and your system,

2097
01:59:56.271 --> 02:00:00.050
something that's been murdered that live the free life,
wild life,

2098
02:00:00.051 --> 02:00:02.900
and then you shoot it with a fucking bow and Arrow and then you take that thing

2099
02:00:02.901 --> 02:00:05.090
and cut it up and eat it.
That's what you need to do.

2100
02:00:05.091 --> 02:00:08.720
And squats and carry logs up hills.
That's what you need to do.

2101
02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:11.170
We don't need to do,
do you mean just,

2102
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:15.330
<v 3>yeah,
that's what girls go wet for.
Begging,</v>

2103
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:20.270
<v 2>bagging.
Ah.
Just going to keep them around and be nice to him.</v>

2104
02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.630
Fuck the shit out of them.
The end,
they leave,
they leave.
He'd go,
Hey,

2105
02:00:23.631 --> 02:00:26.180
you know I did my best.
I was nice to you.
I fucked the shit out of you.

2106
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:27.350
Obviously you've got issues.

2107
02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.650
<v 3>What about this?
What about this?
Remember this.</v>

2108
02:00:30.651 --> 02:00:34.490
Then met miles go,
should we store?

2109
02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.870
He sounds,
it burned into my mind if you ever heard that,

2110
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:42.470
but can you imagine if that wasn't even a real song?

2111
02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:46.370
But it was like a song that occurs in his dream world.
It's Dan Fogelberg,

2112
02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:51.400
Cesar divorce.
These are divorced songs.
These are,
there was,

2113
02:00:52.130 --> 02:00:55.340
there was a divorce boom.
And during this divorce,
boom,

2114
02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.830
this specific genre of music came out.

2115
02:00:57.831 --> 02:01:00.590
And I know it very well cause that's what my mom listened to.

2116
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:04.480
She come and pick me up at the Y and I would sit in the backseat of her car.

2117
02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.950
She listened to like turn around,

2118
02:01:07.190 --> 02:01:11.130
bright eyes fall apart.

2119
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.600
That's a divorce song.
And she would cook.
She would get,
you know,

2120
02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:18.140
it's very like dramatic and those songs are burned into my mind.

2121
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:21.350
And one of them was that Dan Fogelberg song.
Oh My,

2122
02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.190
here's my,
my experience

2123
02:01:25.190 --> 02:01:27.470
<v 2>with Dan Fogelberg when I was growing up,</v>

2124
02:01:27.471 --> 02:01:31.820
I lived in San Francisco when I was about from seven to 11 and uh,

2125
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:35.990
we had a next door neighbor who was cool guy named Barry and uh,
who's,
uh,

2126
02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.520
my Stepdad's a buddy and we would go over place and listen to his records

2127
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:43.790
<v 4>and they had some bad ass records.
Is San Francisco in the 70s.
Man,</v>

2128
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.230
he had the monkeys and all this shit.

2129
02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:48.620
And I just loved the fact that you could put a headphone on and it pushed it,

2130
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:51.350
pushed it to the Jack and you play a record.
And it was like,
you know,

2131
02:01:51.351 --> 02:01:53.810
it was in your head.
I'd be singing along,
they'd have to tell me to shut up,

2132
02:01:53.811 --> 02:01:57.550
stop singing and you sick.
Terrible.
But,
uh,

2133
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.340
I remember thinking like,
wow,
you know,
uh,

2134
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:03.170
my parents listen to some cool ass fucking music.
You know,

2135
02:02:03.171 --> 02:02:06.520
there's some cool music.
Like I listened to some Billy Joel,
you know,

2136
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:09.110
I remember listening to the Captain Jack when I was like seven years old,

2137
02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.910
don't know what a great fucking song this is.
God Damn.
And then,
uh,

2138
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:17.540
we had a friend and I was over his house and I asked him if I could listen to

2139
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:18.950
his music and he said,
yeah.

2140
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.780
And he had a Dan Fogelberg record and I put that shit on.
And I was like,

2141
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:28.560
why does this guy wanted to press me?
Like,
so is this man,

2142
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:33.260
why is this guy singing this?
What is he saying?
You're making me cry,
man.

2143
02:02:33.261 --> 02:02:36.310
I'm fucking seven years old.
You're bumming me out.
You know,

2144
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.170
or whoever I was when I read,
listen to that.
But I was like,

2145
02:02:39.171 --> 02:02:43.910
this is just nonsense music.
Oh,
poor guy.
Somebody needs to tell him.

2146
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:48.260
But then you know,
the thing is,
this is where people get confused.

2147
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:53.170
That one guy,
James Taylor did it,
right?
Yeah.

2148
02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.160
And that's why everybody gets fucked up because he had songs that were like

2149
02:02:58.161 --> 02:03:01.190
super emotional and everything,
but they,

2150
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:06.460
they had such a point of view that they were special.
There was something to do,

2151
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:09.470
the shit that he was singing.
So even though it was,
it was,

2152
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.180
it seemed like it was kind of Mushy,

2153
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:15.350
but in fact it wasn't what it was was just vulnerable and honest.

2154
02:03:15.351 --> 02:03:19.100
And there's like a strength in that.
Yeah,
totally.
You know?
And so these,

2155
02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:20.450
these other motherfuckers,

2156
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:23.480
<v 10>well,
whenever you hate a music,
whenever you hear in a song,</v>

2157
02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.620
make it through the night.
That was something that still confuses me.

2158
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:31.400
What does that mean?
Can we can,
we can make it through the night.
Do you like,

2159
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:33.770
well,
how do you not make it through the night from fucking,

2160
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:35.900
you're not going to die fucking what's the,

2161
02:03:35.901 --> 02:03:39.470
what's the worry when people seeing making it through the night,

2162
02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:44.150
what is it make an out there that night?
No,
no,
this,
it's like there's no,

2163
02:03:44.151 --> 02:03:46.260
it's always sad when they're singing it.
Like they're going,

2164
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:50.780
going to war or something,
you know,
make it,
make it anything.

2165
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:51.740
They mean like getting,

2166
02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:55.220
going through trenches are like not having a nervous breakdown that writers,

2167
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:57.770
<v 4>no,
it's like what it is.</v>

2168
02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:00.920
When you listened to a certain songs and you,
you,

2169
02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:04.490
you hear people getting all emotional and you don't feel like it's,

2170
02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:06.140
you don't feel like it's valid.

2171
02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.140
It's like you're being too much of a pussy in this song.
Oh,

2172
02:04:09.150 --> 02:04:11.060
you're being put too much of a pussy with your expression.

2173
02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:15.320
I could go along with you here.
I can get caught up in the wave and go with you,

2174
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:19.790
but I don't feel like it's necessary.
I don't feel like it warrants it,
you know?

2175
02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:23.790
Then you listen to like James Taylor and you hear like just yesterday morning

2176
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:27.530
they met me know you will go.
Yeah,
of course.

2177
02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:29.100
A depressing fucking song.

2178
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:34.130
I seen fire and ice and rain since sunny days I thought would never end.

2179
02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:37.070
Or Elliot Smith who was an Elliot Smith,
same.

2180
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:42.110
<v 2>He would know like Rogan,</v>

2181
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.730
Rogan one I don't think would like Elliot Smith at all.
Yeah,

2182
02:04:44.731 --> 02:04:48.160
I listened to some of his stuff.
I wanted to kick him in the balls.
I was like,

2183
02:04:48.161 --> 02:04:50.880
kid,
you need to get out of the house,
stop playing video games.

2184
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:58.430
I will listen to one song because Duncan told me how great the guy was.
Like wow,

2185
02:04:59.130 --> 02:05:01.380
there's a lot of shit that I love that I'm sure you don't love.

2186
02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:03.490
You know Elliot Smith.
Um,

2187
02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:06.800
do you have a listen to kiss alone in your car and say along nope.

2188
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:10.830
Black keys all the way back.
He got a lot of black lives.
That's awesome.

2189
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:14.310
They're great.
I went on a period for like four months,
so that's all I listen to.

2190
02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:14.660
Yeah.

2191
02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:17.490
I would go on my car and I got the iPod thing in the car and I would just go

2192
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:20.160
right to black keys.
Yeah.
You know what I've been listening to lately.

2193
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:24.370
What you'll make fun of me spangle to [inaudible].
This is one,

2194
02:05:24.371 --> 02:05:29.371
he did a spangle a thing where they took their music and they combined it with

2195
02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:33.990
me talking about DMT.
That's cool.
Yeah it's pretty dope.
Songs are tripping man.

2196
02:05:33.991 --> 02:05:37.490
One of the songs I was just listening to down and write,

2197
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:38.670
I like writing and listening to him.

2198
02:05:39.150 --> 02:05:44.150
One of his songs I was hearing today the lyrics are like Lsd DMT

2199
02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:47.970
<v 3>and it's like if you heard that song it's really,
we are,
I'm,</v>

2200
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:51.040
I mean I can't even sing it cause you have to have like seven synthesizers in a

2201
02:05:51.041 --> 02:05:55.610
Ufo just to make fucking noises are coming out of here.

2202
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:58.360
Devon Ufo like rave music.
Right.

2203
02:05:58.361 --> 02:06:01.270
Is that what you would consider raving and kind of like ambient rave music or

2204
02:06:01.271 --> 02:06:03.880
something?
It's,
but yeah,
some of it's,
yeah,
it's not,

2205
02:06:03.881 --> 02:06:05.710
it doesn't have like as much of a driving beat.

2206
02:06:05.711 --> 02:06:10.500
It's just more like super trippy psych.
The guy really did capture

2207
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:15.130
<v 2>something and brought it back through music.
He's,
it's w he's really good.</v>

2208
02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:15.921
It's really good.

2209
02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:20.510
It's not like I've listened to some of that stuff that's not so focused,

2210
02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.630
not so tuned in.
It's really kind of gross.
Yeah.
I can't,

2211
02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:26.060
it's like everything else,
man.
It's like mushy song.

2212
02:06:26.061 --> 02:06:28.850
It's like what we just talked about James Taylor and he's not mushy.
Right.

2213
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.480
You know?
But like there's certain we meet not,
there's not Moshi,
his genuine,

2214
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:37.550
there's certain people like they get really offended by non genuine behavior.

2215
02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:37.760
Yeah.

2216
02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.760
Like there's some huge push to get Nickelback [inaudible] moved from,

2217
02:06:43.251 --> 02:06:46.980
what is it a hockey game?
Is it,
is it hockey?
The Nickelback thing?
Uh,

2218
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:50.660
I can't remember.
I think so.
It might be football.

2219
02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:54.280
<v 3>I saw this thing on reddit and I,
maybe I don't,
I'm not remembering it right.</v>

2220
02:06:54.281 --> 02:06:57.220
But it said,
if you ever want to hide files on your computer,

2221
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:59.290
right folder that says Nicole.

2222
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.220
<v 2>That's hilarious.
I met the dude very briefly,
the lead singer guy in a,
um,
uh,</v>

2223
02:07:08.221 --> 02:07:11.430
a venue once where the UFC was going to be there on Saturday and he was there on

2224
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:12.000
Friday.

2225
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.960
Friday was very nice guy as lions Thanksgiving game protest for Nickelback.

2226
02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:19.260
He's got,
they got some good songs,
man.
I'm sorry.
They say they're slick,

2227
02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:21.490
they're overproduced.
It seems like they're,
you know,

2228
02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:25.290
almost people like them because they're too good a pop song,
you know?

2229
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:28.770
And sometimes they're like,
uh,
the,
the,
you know,

2230
02:07:28.771 --> 02:07:33.540
it's almost too cliche,
but they're good that I want to be a rock star Song.

2231
02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:36.130
This has been a million of those,
the Cypress Hill

2232
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:36.963
<v 4>version.</v>

2233
02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:40.470
<v 3>So you'd want to be a rockstar.
That's the best one.</v>

2234
02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:47.360
I ended up at the bar.
I got to admit,
man,
I've got very,
very limited.
Yeah.

2235
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:50.340
<v 4>Cypress Hill version is bad out I Cypress Hill,</v>

2236
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:54.000
but that's a bad ass rock star Song.
But the Nickelback one is not bad,
man.

2237
02:07:54.030 --> 02:07:57.810
It's not,
it's not a bad song.
I ever heard that song.
I want to be a rock style.

2238
02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:01.740
Go.
I'm sorry.
Really?
Well,
I don't,
I don't hate Nickelback.
Okay.

2239
02:08:01.741 --> 02:08:04.230
I don't particularly look forward to listening to them,

2240
02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:06.270
but they got some good songs.
They're not,

2241
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:08.910
that's like his voice or the style of their music.

2242
02:08:08.911 --> 02:08:12.180
Just like chalk seems almost,

2243
02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:17.060
it seems like people feel like it's not honest or something,
you know?

2244
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:19.650
W what is it?
I mean,
is it,

2245
02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:22.950
<v 3>well,
there are affected.
It's affected their videos.</v>

2246
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.210
I think I've seen a Nickelback video and it was very effective effected and it

2247
02:08:27.211 --> 02:08:31.560
was very,
uh,
um,
hard to watch because it was sappy and like cheese.

2248
02:08:31.561 --> 02:08:36.030
Super cheesy.
But yeah,
I like,
I,
I don't have a strong opinion about them.

2249
02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.640
They also seem like,
you know,
there's certain bands like,

2250
02:08:38.641 --> 02:08:43.020
remember when new kids on the block came out and it was like kind of hip to not

2251
02:08:43.021 --> 02:08:45.000
like new kids on the block.
It's like,

2252
02:08:45.001 --> 02:08:47.130
they're kind of like that where it's a mark of the,

2253
02:08:47.210 --> 02:08:50.610
it's like a fashion to not like them or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,

2254
02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:53.430
they've got some good stripper song.
I've never listened to that.
I don't know.

2255
02:08:53.670 --> 02:08:54.700
I've only listened to dean that one.

2256
02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:57.330
How could it be worse than some of foreigner songs?

2257
02:08:58.410 --> 02:09:02.810
I've been waiting for a girl like you food.
I like that

2258
02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.440
<v 4>it's a good song.
But come on man.
How is,</v>

2259
02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:07.620
how are any of the Nickelback songs any less sad?

2260
02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:12.110
<v 3>Yeah,
I believe that first.
I believe that guy.
I don't believe this.</v>

2261
02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:14.060
Nickelback I think this guy's just like

2262
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:17.940
<v 4>sincere.
So you think it gets packaged pre produced,</v>

2263
02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:22.670
Cook is frail Yo later thought out to to calculated.

2264
02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:23.360
Is that what it is?

2265
02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:26.250
<v 3>What do you think that guy like?
I think radio killed Nickelback for me,</v>

2266
02:09:26.251 --> 02:09:27.480
I think it's,
I believe

2267
02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:28.010
<v 4>radio from,</v>

2268
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:31.520
it's interesting with this subject because we talked about a real band.

2269
02:09:31.521 --> 02:09:36.410
I mean as real and scratchy as you can get.
The black keys,
they're like scratchy.

2270
02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.520
They're like almost like,

2271
02:09:37.521 --> 02:09:39.680
even though it's an MP three like you could hear the record,

2272
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:43.430
you know those guys are like that.
That's a band man.

2273
02:09:43.431 --> 02:09:47.090
There's a band playing instruments and singing and these are some songs they

2274
02:09:47.091 --> 02:09:49.130
wrote and this is the sounds they like.

2275
02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:51.920
And if you're drinking whiskey and playing pool,

2276
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:53.480
that's the fucking song you want to hear.

2277
02:09:53.481 --> 02:09:55.610
You want to hear that shit in the background.
You know they got,

2278
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:57.230
that's real music man.

2279
02:09:57.570 --> 02:10:01.380
<v 14>And then you've got,
you know,</v>

2280
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.490
<v 4>other stuff like Nickelback that's like this.</v>

2281
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.490
This is a sort of a different thing.

2282
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.520
It's like they just got it honed down to like the slick Lee packaged sort of,

2283
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.030
kind of cliche and it's intense but very well done.

2284
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:19.850
Like you can't criticize any aspects,
so it's very well gone.
That's this.

2285
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:23.980
The voice is strong and the sing the guitars good,
but somehow or another,

2286
02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:27.160
some for some people the,
they get upset by it.

2287
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:30.860
<v 3>Well,
some people,
it's really weird man.
Some people just,
they're,</v>

2288
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:33.830
they're rubber ain't touching the road when it comes to what they're making.

2289
02:10:33.831 --> 02:10:34.010
They're

2290
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.280
<v 10>just,
they're purely imitative,
right?</v>

2291
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:39.570
Some people have like plugged into the fucking,
uh,

2292
02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:42.920
magma and they're vomiting out this thing.
They're like,

2293
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:46.640
they've become a channel to something and it's undeniable when you hear it,

2294
02:10:46.641 --> 02:10:50.030
even if you don't like it,
you can still tell.
This is definitely a real,

2295
02:10:50.031 --> 02:10:51.740
most of the time you can still tell this is,

2296
02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:55.190
this is something super unique and special.
It's very,
to me,

2297
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:59.570
it's funny when you see imitators,
it's funny when you,
cause you can't fake it.

2298
02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:02.900
It's one thing you can't fucking fake.
It's like what Joey Diaz says.

2299
02:11:02.901 --> 02:11:04.580
I don't know if he still says there.
It says it all the time.

2300
02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:08.140
Holograms ever heard him say that they're holograms.
Yeah.

2301
02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:12.410
He says that about people that are fake.
Yeah.
He's a fucking Hologram.
Yeah.

2302
02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.800
It's interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't really fake it.

2303
02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:19.790
And when you see like [inaudible] but with some artists they really plug into
it.

2304
02:11:19.791 --> 02:11:23.990
Like that fucking kid I was telling you about.
Yes.
Yeah,
I think he's,
yeah,

2305
02:11:23.991 --> 02:11:27.880
nine or two.
I think he's not,
well this is,
I think he's 12 wow.
Yeah.

2306
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:31.190
Well I think the,
the,
it's all going through the Internet apparently.

2307
02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:35.480
There was like a big piece on him from my 2006 and now he's been like studying

2308
02:11:35.481 --> 02:11:35.890
and,
and

2309
02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:37.710
<v 5>Europe looks this whole time.
But yeah,</v>

2310
02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:39.940
you told me about him and then after you told me about them,

2311
02:11:39.941 --> 02:11:43.090
it was all over Twitter,
all over my message board.

2312
02:11:43.091 --> 02:11:45.890
There was like a couple of different threads about it.
You know,
it just,
it's a

2313
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:49.510
<v 10>meme,
you know about this kid.
You saw this thing or this kid.
He's like,</v>

2314
02:11:49.511 --> 02:11:52.450
they say super genius to get super genius musician.

2315
02:11:52.451 --> 02:11:54.840
He's like the greatest musician to come along.

2316
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:58.540
<v 2>Oh,
is he that movie based off of him?
No,
no,
no,
no.
This is a new kid.</v>

2317
02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:01.650
And tell him when he does.
This is crazy.

2318
02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:04.190
<v 10>He,
the one of this segment I saw,
it's,</v>

2319
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:07.830
I'm sure if you youtube this kid you can find it right away,
but he,
he,

2320
02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:13.170
he's with his piano teacher and he takes the music and he flips it backwards and

2321
02:12:13.171 --> 02:12:15.420
upside down and he can play it backwards.

2322
02:12:15.421 --> 02:12:18.570
He can play music backwards and upside down too.
That's what she,

2323
02:12:18.571 --> 02:12:21.180
and she was like,
I don't see how he al,
anyone can do this.

2324
02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.410
He's composed like five symphonies and they say that most people don't do that

2325
02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:26.970
or do that in their lifetime.

2326
02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.250
<v 5>Wrap your head around that.
Wrap your head around that kid.
What is that?</v>

2327
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:33.490
What is that?
Is it a mild form of autism

2328
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:36.260
<v 10>matrix?
He tapped.
That's not him.</v>

2329
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:46.670
<v 2>How does he do that?
We'll get this skill involved.
The,
I don't understand.</v>

2330
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:51.140
We're looking at a little boy who was literally looking at the keyboard.

2331
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:55.850
It's amazing.
He has his back to the piano.
Listen to the music.

2332
02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.680
He's a prodigy.
What if we get so dumb that this is what is considered?

2333
02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:05.000
It's a super chimp.
Gradguru.
Have you had a champion?
I can do that.

2334
02:13:05.001 --> 02:13:07.780
Not only can my chimp do this.
Joe,
did you hear,

2335
02:13:08.210 --> 02:13:11.270
why don't you all find that video as I'm trying to do what is a what?

2336
02:13:11.271 --> 02:13:12.860
What would you think the problem is?
I can't remember

2337
02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:15.600
<v 10>name.
So you'd have to look up like Ah,</v>

2338
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:18.300
<v 2>12 year old girl.
She's super genius musician.</v>

2339
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:21.161
Yeah,

2340
02:13:21.161 --> 02:13:25.970
and he pretty much says what all super genius guys say is that it just comes

2341
02:13:25.971 --> 02:13:26.340
down.

2342
02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:30.000
<v 10>He says he hears it,
he just hears it and he writes down what he hears.</v>

2343
02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:32.080
That's what it is.
Wow.
Oh,

2344
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.800
<v 15>how the fuck did he do it backwards?
That's amazing.</v>

2345
02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.510
That's just showing off the little fuck.
Yeah.
You know the pro,

2346
02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:42.000
I don't think,
I don't know if this is him.

2347
02:13:42.070 --> 02:13:46.790
<v 2>What is it?
That's actually
Brian,</v>

2348
02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:51.580
did you put butthole and the suits search?
Hey,

2349
02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:53.710
let's butthole in a search.
Really?
I don't understand.

2350
02:13:53.711 --> 02:13:55.110
It seems like that waste time.
Yeah,

2351
02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:59.430
that's Brian always Google searches.
He adds buttholes.

2352
02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:02.280
<v 15>That's,
that's definitely,
definitely not.
I am Brian.</v>

2353
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:10.180
<v 2>Find it.
Brian.
That was listed under an amazing 10 year old,</v>

2354
02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:12.310
12 year old.
I know.

2355
02:14:12.311 --> 02:14:16.790
That's what happened to be super genius musician and it's not going Juilliard

2356
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:20.580
host.
How many?
What did you do?
Five symphonies,
right?

2357
02:14:20.581 --> 02:14:23.500
Come bright 12 year old composed five symphonies.

2358
02:14:23.501 --> 02:14:26.230
Put that in Google and you'll find it will tweet to us.
Yeah,

2359
02:14:26.231 --> 02:14:27.130
they probably already have,

2360
02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:32.770
but if you just Google 12 year old composed five symphonies for sure you'll find

2361
02:14:32.771 --> 02:14:32.920
that.

2362
02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:37.610
<v 15>Got It.
Got It.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See that's a blue Jay.</v>

2363
02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:42.730
<v 16>Just renowned Julliard school who some say is the greatest talent to come along</v>

2364
02:14:42.731 --> 02:14:44.940
in 200 years.
What was written?

2365
02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:47.940
<v 2>I'm saying that about you.
Listen to this</v>

2366
02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.860
<v 15>12
oh shit.
What happened?</v>

2367
02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.270
It was just the commercial.

2368
02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:02.170
<v 16>There's a composer studying at New York's where now and Judah,</v>

2369
02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:06.720
who some say is the greatest talent to come along into

2370
02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:09.510
<v 5>so on and sand sands.</v>

2371
02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:13.510
<v 16>Sam Zeeman is a composer.</v>

2372
02:15:13.690 --> 02:15:18.010
He teaches music theory to Jay at Julliard in New York City where he's been

2373
02:15:18.011 --> 02:15:19.710
teaching for 17 years.

2374
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:23.160
<v 5>Mel Levine's,
this is an absolute fact.
This is objective.</v>

2375
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:25.440
This is not a subjective opinion.

2376
02:15:25.710 --> 02:15:29.760
They could be sitting right here and he could be composing right now.

2377
02:15:29.761 --> 02:15:34.761
She could finish a piano sonata before our very eyes in probably 25 minutes and

2378
02:15:35.851 --> 02:15:38.700
it will be a great piece.
How's that possible?

2379
02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:43.030
<v 16>Well,
Jay told us he doesn't know where the music comes from,</v>

2380
02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:48.040
but it comes fully written,
playing like an orchestra in his head.

2381
02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:50.840
<v 2>As you hear it playing,
can you change it as it goes along?</v>

2382
02:15:50.841 --> 02:15:51.920
Can you say your cell phone?

2383
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:55.490
Let's bring the oboes and here let's bring the string section here

2384
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:59.810
<v 15>to come in by themselves if they need to.
It's not something you're trying to do.</v>

2385
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.160
It's like the unconscious mind is giving orders at the speed of light.
You know?

2386
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:06.860
I mean,

2387
02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:11.480
so I just hear it as if it were a smooth performance of a work already written

2388
02:16:12.110 --> 02:16:16.730
when it isn't.
It's involuntary.

2389
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:21.050
Oh,
so yeah,
like the beating of the heart.
You don't have to think about it

2390
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:23.583
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

2391
02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:27.430
<v 16>like it seems all the kids are downloading music these days.</v>

2392
02:16:27.431 --> 02:16:32.431
It's just that Jay with his program is downloading it from his mind.

2393
02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:37.420
The program records his notes and plays them back.

2394
02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:43.270
That is where the computers up and running.

2395
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:48.670
J composes so rapidly that he often crashes the computer.

2396
02:16:49.210 --> 02:16:52.060
It is.
It isn't a book.
You got a picture of the score,

2397
02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:57.080
the better get them a better teacher.
It's a project.
Give them a Mac book.

2398
02:16:57.370 --> 02:17:00.310
Jason parents are as surprised as anyone.

2399
02:17:00.370 --> 02:17:03.750
One neither is a professional musician.
His father,

2400
02:17:03.751 --> 02:17:08.430
Robert is a linguist to scholar in Slavic language who lost his sight at the age

2401
02:17:08.431 --> 02:17:12.450
of 36 to retinitis Pigmentosa is mother or no,

2402
02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:16.740
isn't Israeli born painter?
That's Michael Jay's eight year old brother.

2403
02:17:17.010 --> 02:17:20.430
He's not a musical prodigy,
but Robert and or no,

2404
02:17:20.431 --> 02:17:23.760
remember when they figured out that Jay was

2405
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.590
<v 3>I think around two.
So one of the Penn state kids writing,
whoa.
Look at that.</v>

2406
02:17:28.591 --> 02:17:33.200
Back to the drawing instruments.
We know that he was fascinated with it.

2407
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:36.750
Started writing.
Yeah.
At the age of two.
Yes.

2408
02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:42.300
So looking man and just see what you brought it to the same channel and wrote

2409
02:17:42.301 --> 02:17:43.350
the word cello.

2410
02:17:43.410 --> 02:17:47.810
And I was surprised because neither of us have anything to do with stringed

2411
02:17:47.811 --> 02:17:52.560
instruments.
Um,
and I didn't expect him to know what it was,

2412
02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:54.110
what a cello was.
Right.

2413
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:57.660
You didn't have a cello that we had no channel your house.
Have you seen a cello?

2414
02:17:57.730 --> 02:17:58.563
Nope,

2415
02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:00.470
<v 16>but he knew he wanted one.</v>

2416
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:05.030
So his mother brought him to a music store where he was shown a miniature cello

2417
02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:09.250
<v 3>and he just sat there.
He put the cello and he started playing on it.</v>

2418
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:12.670
And I was like,
how do you know how to do this

2419
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:16.120
<v 16>by age three?
Schiele drawing cellos.</v>

2420
02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:20.680
But he had turned them into notes on a scale,
reincarnate beginning to compose.

2421
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.490
Wow.
Jay's parents watched the notes come faster and faster.

2422
02:18:24.491 --> 02:18:28.450
He was writing any time,
anywhere by elementary school.

2423
02:18:28.451 --> 02:18:33.451
His teachers had no idea how to handle a boy whose hero wasn't Batman,

2424
02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:34.960
but Beethoven.

2425
02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:38.420
<v 3>He hears music in his head all the time.
That's awesome.</v>

2426
02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:42.610
<v 16>Jay has been told his hearing is many times more sensitive than an average</v>

2427
02:18:42.611 --> 02:18:47.050
person.
The sound is shut out manually,

2428
02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:51.220
but Jay can't turn off the music in his head.
In fact,
yeah,

2429
02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:53.000
he told us he often,
yes.

2430
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:56.450
Here's more than one new composition at a time.

2431
02:18:56.780 --> 02:19:01.780
<v 3>Multiple channels is what has been termed multiple channels.</v>

2432
02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:07.490
My brain is able to control two or three different musics at the same time.

2433
02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:08.353
Whoa.

2434
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:13.160
Along with the channel of everyday life and everything else.

2435
02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.920
<v 16>J channel this piece,
when he was eight,</v>

2436
02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:25.070
by the age of 10,

2437
02:19:25.071 --> 02:19:30.071
Jay was going to Julliard among the top conservatories of music on a full

2438
02:19:30.081 --> 02:19:30.914
scholarship,

2439
02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:37.490
<v 15>considered imitation,
um,
an extra concrete objects line.</v>

2440
02:19:37.770 --> 02:19:41.510
<v 16>At age 11,
he was studying music massive.
That was your kid,
your college,
you know,</v>

2441
02:19:41.511 --> 02:19:45.240
like I'm a fucking idiot.
Jl Genius for horses at another school,

2442
02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:50.540
which is Karen say he'll complete when he's 14 completely and stay with

2443
02:19:52.170 --> 02:19:56.460
Elizabeth Wolf is a well known as a concert pianist who works with Jay on his

2444
02:19:56.461 --> 02:20:00.540
piano technique.
One more today.

2445
02:20:00.541 --> 02:20:04.170
Jay brought one of his own works to practice.
Yeah.
You need this

2446
02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:10.050
no choice.
Right.
Jay writes things that he can't even play.

2447
02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:15.000
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's the experience.
Phoenix is this good?
Keep up

2448
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:21.360
<v 15>to Canon.
It's a few,
Huh?</v>

2449
02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:24.330
<v 16>Jenny wants to perfect his piano playing.</v>

2450
02:20:24.331 --> 02:20:29.331
Although he says he doesn't need the piano or any instrument to compose.

2451
02:20:30.330 --> 02:20:34.590
<v 15>When you first hear this tune start to rise in your head,</v>

2452
02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:39.050
what happens?
Well at first they just listened to it.
Um,

2453
02:20:39.570 --> 02:20:42.600
and then I started humming it and then when walking,

2454
02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:45.600
I like walking a lot when I'm in,
when I'm inspired

2455
02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:50.640
because then I walked to the beat of the,
yeah.

2456
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:51.523
<v 17>Music.</v>

2457
02:20:55.410 --> 02:21:00.410
<v 15>Sorry.
Exam of the beat is
when I start walking</v>

2458
02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.770
and often I start conducting as well.

2459
02:21:08.890 --> 02:21:09.723
<v 17>Yes.</v>

2460
02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:11.920
<v 16>Magazine that walking down the street</v>

2461
02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:18.650
I'd be like James [inaudible] usual 12 year old,
oops.
And he knows it.
Oh,

2462
02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:20.020
what happens when Jay gets bored?

2463
02:21:20.090 --> 02:21:24.870
<v 18>Oh,
when he gets bored,
he gets killed.
The cat starts improvising.
Last week,
um,
uh,</v>

2464
02:21:24.871 --> 02:21:26.330
he took the Beethoven Sonata,

2465
02:21:26.331 --> 02:21:28.610
the working right and now and decided that everything would be kind of

2466
02:21:28.611 --> 02:21:30.410
interesting,
upside down and backwards.

2467
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:32.930
So he took the volume and literally did just that.

2468
02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:35.720
He can do it for you right now.
And um,
I couldn't even follow,

2469
02:21:35.721 --> 02:21:40.020
but he actually took the clefs and inverted them.
The trouble became base base.

2470
02:21:40.021 --> 02:21:41.660
We can trouble and did it backwards

2471
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:56.380
<v 16>saying she goes,
tell us a little bit the toasters,
Mike.
Right.</v>

2472
02:21:56.470 --> 02:21:58.780
Five or six symphonies in a lifetime.

2473
02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:03.750
Jay's written five at the age of 12.
Hello,

2474
02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:07.180
nice to meet you
here.

2475
02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:09.630
Jay's explaining the storm.
Two conductor,

2476
02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:12.000
young hope Hawk at the rehearsal is cool.

2477
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:16.840
What a strange thing to be fucking awesome at music that's kind of like

2478
02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:18.640
outdated,
but he got lucky man.

2479
02:22:18.641 --> 02:22:21.400
He got born into a great family so you can get that dude,

2480
02:22:21.401 --> 02:22:25.420
they should call out to him and get that dude to make some jam and pop tunes the

2481
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.273
listen dude,

2482
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:30.620
<v 2>is it dead fucking song?
Nobody listens to the cello anymore,
bro.
Come on man.</v>

2483
02:22:30.621 --> 02:22:32.160
You wanna make some money.
You want to be a rockstar?

2484
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:35.610
You want to live like Nickelback.
They should at least get them a Mac book pro.

2485
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:40.080
That's it.
Yeah,
it's the shit is crashing.
Man's got that wack ass old laptop.

2486
02:22:41.050 --> 02:22:42.960
He'll still running on Mac.

2487
02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:44.820
<v 3>Yeah.
That's a shit computer.</v>

2488
02:22:44.821 --> 02:22:48.540
If it can't even run a composing program will say it's like pushing a button on

2489
02:22:48.541 --> 02:22:52.590
the keyboard.
It's a god damn genius.
Fess up coming up with the [inaudible].

2490
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:57.180
But if that kid had been born in the wrong family,
yeah,
he's dry drawing notes.

2491
02:22:57.330 --> 02:23:00.900
Quit drawing that shit.
What is that gate light gay language.

2492
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:04.160
You get this fucking kid outta here.
What do you think is going on with that?

2493
02:23:04.470 --> 02:23:07.500
Do you think that's like a Asperger's and autism thing?

2494
02:23:07.501 --> 02:23:09.630
Is that it seems like it a little bit incarnation,

2495
02:23:09.631 --> 02:23:12.280
I think does weird markings on his head and he looks like you.

2496
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:15.930
A shot right above the eyebrow.
Really?
Yeah.

2497
02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.940
<v 2>Do you think that that happens when a baby's born,
it's been reincarnated.</v>

2498
02:23:18.941 --> 02:23:21.660
You see like the wounds and people did,
did they really?
Yeah.

2499
02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:24.740
<v 3>I wish I have a mark right on the back of my neck like I was executed.</v>

2500
02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.840
Whoa state by those damn chairman.
You have any marks,
Joe?

2501
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:34.210
Mark of the beast.
I know that.
But do you have any ink reincarnation Martin?
Yes.

2502
02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:37.230
<v 2>It's not.
It's ugly ass hole dug and I think we've got to end this because a,</v>

2503
02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:40.720
you've got to get out of here.
Fucking sucks.
I don't want to leave.
I got to go.

2504
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:42.460
Well we got to go.
What are you doing?

2505
02:23:42.461 --> 02:23:47.230
That's more important than us going to dinner with my girlfriend.
Oh snap.

2506
02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:53.340
Yeah,
the one fucking day.
There was no all garden reference.

2507
02:23:53.341 --> 02:23:57.580
This content.
How many?
Seriously?

2508
02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:02.100
How many podcasts do you think you've said all of gardening and I know you get

2509
02:24:02.130 --> 02:24:05.500
so mad.
I know they do,
but um,
when you think about it,

2510
02:24:05.501 --> 02:24:09.400
like over the year or two years,
almost two years we've been doing this podcast.

2511
02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:10.360
When did you start doing it?

2512
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:14.490
<v 3>I've always just said of Guardian in normal conversation for some reason.</v>

2513
02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:15.301
<v 2>Yeah,
I know you have.</v>

2514
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:18.840
But in the podcast you want somewhere along the line you made a point of saying

2515
02:24:18.841 --> 02:24:19.500
it all the time.

2516
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:22.440
<v 3>I think it was just recent tit and I actually made it a point before I was just</v>

2517
02:24:22.441 --> 02:24:26.460
like,
anytime I wanted to use a generic restaurant name,
I would say olive garden,

2518
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:30.160
<v 2>no one.
Uh,
no,
we'll,
we'll keep a joke going longer than this flux.
Great.</v>

2519
02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:31.500
He is the BA phase,

2520
02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:36.890
the phase w Brian and I went on the road for fucking years doing clubs.

2521
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.860
Okay.

2522
02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:41.310
And Brian would make these cool videos of the clubs and everything and one of

2523
02:24:41.311 --> 02:24:43.830
the things he would do is every time I took a picture with fans,

2524
02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:47.040
every time Brian would get in the background and let go.

2525
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:48.350
<v 3>Yeah.
I know.</v>

2526
02:24:48.350 --> 02:24:52.940
I mean there's thousands of pictures and my favorites when I find it on like a

2527
02:24:52.941 --> 02:24:55.700
website,
there's girls with corpses and seeing that website,

2528
02:24:55.701 --> 02:24:58.160
but then you're just looking through it and it's like,
oh look,
Joe Rogan,

2529
02:24:58.200 --> 02:24:59.750
he seen me in the background making a face.

2530
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.920
<v 2>Yeah.
Dude,
I bought,
faced a picture of,
uh,
uh,
Eddie Bravo and David Lee Roth</v>

2531
02:25:07.050 --> 02:25:09.150
is taking a picture of David Lee Roth and I'm in the background.

2532
02:25:10.350 --> 02:25:13.590
That's the buffets.
You,
it easily did that 10,000 times.

2533
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:17.310
That's not an exaggeration.
Yeah,
that sounds ridiculous.
New ones all the time.

2534
02:25:18.690 --> 02:25:19.523
Yeah.
They're out there.

2535
02:25:19.650 --> 02:25:22.470
The days of my space there were easy to find and he'd go to people's,

2536
02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:24.820
I sometimes I saw them in people's avatars.
Yeah.

2537
02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:31.220
Guide it to making those cases as hemp bags on his website.

2538
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:35.230
He has,
yeah,
he has.

2539
02:25:35.231 --> 02:25:39.700
He on your website in the office,
those bags or Megan has company mission.

2540
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:44.550
10 bags are great.
What does it,
what does the website,
the website,

2541
02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:47.880
but s gear.com,
I think.
Something like that.
I think that's it.

2542
02:25:47.970 --> 02:25:52.180
You notice them on Twitter,
right?
Twitter,
DSG gear.
That's all.
All hemp,
uh,

2543
02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:56.290
bags and he's a Jujitsu student.

San Francisco's awesome.
One of the fucking best place,</v>

2555

you know,

2556
02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.840
not San Francisco still.
I'm psyched.
Northern California's awesome.

2557
02:26:38.130 --> 02:26:41.360
She's still more Asians there than any place else.
There is real weird.

2558
02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:44.630
San Francisco's real strange.
It's weird how many Asians or are there was.

2559
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:47.710
We went to San Francisco Museum once and they kind of explained it all.

2560
02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:51.880
<v 2>Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like this weird lady is bread.</v>

Hell good.
He's bread.
Jesus Christ.
He can't help it.

2562
02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:00.970
He can't help but look at them.
How can you be mad at him and you,
you know,

2563
02:27:00.971 --> 02:27:01.990

thank you to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t,

2579
02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:55.470
makers of Alpha brain knew mood,

2580
02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:58.410
knew mood is a five HTP supplements.
Uh,

2581
02:27:58.460 --> 02:28:03.250
it's five HTP and a bunch of other stuff including El Tryptofan,
which,
uh,

2582
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:07.740
believe converts to five HTP,
which eventually converged to serotonin.

2583
02:28:07.741 --> 02:28:10.950
And the idea is that it's a like a time release sort of effect.
Uh,

2584
02:28:10.951 --> 02:28:12.990
I've been a digging that too.
I've been trying that.

2585
02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:16.560
I like five HTP something a Neil Brennan told me about.
You ever try out?

2586
02:28:16.770 --> 02:28:20.020
<v 2>Um,

I took it one day.
I can still feel good.
Yeah,

2587
02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:22.040
It makes you feel good.

like you said,</v>

2589
02:28:24.531 --> 02:28:25.364

2590

Ladies and gentlemen,

2596

we will be back next week.

2597
02:28:46.971 --> 02:28:51.970
We got a bunch of different crazy mother fuckers coming in next week.
Um,

2598
02:28:52.410 --> 02:28:54.050
uh,
no one's tied down yet,

2599
02:28:54.051 --> 02:28:57.830
but there's some interesting ones really interesting once.
So,
um,
that's it.

2600
02:28:57.831 --> 02:29:02.831
And Joey Diaz and Eddie Bravo and I are talking about doing regular MMA podcasts

2601
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:05.060
and might as well do.

2602
02:29:05.061 --> 02:29:07.820
I'm here because there's more room and Joey can scream and shout.

2603
02:29:08.090 --> 02:29:11.090
But the idea is people keep saying like,
wow,
you guys talk about MMA,

2604
02:29:11.091 --> 02:29:13.970
why don't you talk about it?
Because a lot of times it's just me talking,

2605
02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:16.580
you know?
It's like,
you know,
if it's with you guys,

2606
02:29:16.581 --> 02:29:19.250
I'm talking to MMA with you guys.
I mean Dunkin,
you saw the fights in England,

2607
02:29:19.251 --> 02:29:23.000
but it,
you know,
I mean,
how much do you want to talk about it?
Oh,

2608
02:29:23.001 --> 02:29:24.650
that one got kicked out.
One guy.
That was awesome.

2609
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:28.820
I wouldn't mind talking about some of the musical choices people come on with

2610
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:30.130
another podcast.
Yeah,

2611
02:29:30.210 --> 02:29:33.560
there's a cool video of Chris Liebing coming out to that mad mad world song.

2612
02:29:33.561 --> 02:29:37.640
Yeah.
And the audience is singing along to it.
It's really cool,
man.

2613
02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:40.700
And I didn't realize it was happening while I was doing the commentary because

2614
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:43.790
we're talking and the music's playing really loud.
We can't see it.

2615
02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:48.190
But this video is pretty dope.
It's like Chris bins coming out,
you know,

2616
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:52.580
<v 19>faces laces</v>

2617
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:58.760
<v 4>and everyone's singing along to it and it's really kinda chilling,
you know,</v>

2618
02:29:58.761 --> 02:30:01.430
it's really kind of catchy.
Anyway,

02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:06.230
