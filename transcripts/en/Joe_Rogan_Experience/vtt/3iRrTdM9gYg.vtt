00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

269
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I had an all out.</v>

270
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It got pretty ugly with uh,</v>

271
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>bigly on ONA.</v>

273
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>He came,</v>

274
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>he was doing the virus tour one show.</v>

275
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.301
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

277
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>and we squashed this,</v>

278
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's on you.</v>

279
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.861
<v Speaker 1>We squash it.</v>

280
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't have the best set that deal.</v>

281
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And I was hosting those shows and that don't want any slice me.</v>

282
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>So he went on and he goes,</v>

283
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you want me to be like,</v>

284
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and work the crowd.</v>

285
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>So he started going out to the crowd and it didn't go well.</v>

286
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's not all his fault too.</v>

287
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>They put them up towards the end of the show,</v>

292
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:43.580

294
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.953

<v Speaker 1>They're mutants.</v>

299
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

302
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.823
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

303
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

304
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but then he came into ona and he and I had been doing this show for fucking</v>

305
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>years and he started making fun of how I talk.</v>

306
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>He made some joke and he was being really arrogant and this and that.</v>

307
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.414
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

308
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

309
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 1>I started booing and I'm,</v>

311
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:10.371
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let me make you feel on blue.</v>

313
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And then it just got worse and worse and it got really ugly.</v>

314
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>But he was so passive aggressive about his fucking swarmy type of fucking humor,</v>

315
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.161
<v Speaker 1>but don't come.</v>

316
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 1>That's like what I just fucking trash,</v>

317
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>which I shouldn't have because he says you're a fucking deal.</v>

318
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.463
<v Speaker 1>This is your deal.</v>

319
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

320
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm only kidding,</v>

321
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:29.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

323
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

324
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

325

00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:39.380

<v Speaker 1>everything's a fucking,</v>

334
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you say something wrong or do this or you're done.</v>

335
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

336
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I heard the first day back when he sat and,</v>

337
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

338
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Shared Christie,</v>

339
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

340
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's fuck him.</v>

341
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I never really liked him.</v>

342
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

343
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

344
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>let's get this audition started.</v>

345
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Anthony's chairs in fucking long island.</v>

346
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

347
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.583
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

348
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:05.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:06.541
<v Speaker 1>showed no,</v>

350
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>just sometimes fun.</v>

351
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what people don't understand.</v>

352
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

353
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be in that company.</v>

354
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It's good times.</v>

355
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>People are so sensitive about goofing on each other.</v>

356
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>People are so sensitive about people cracking jokes.</v>

358
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>But if someone cracks a joke about something that you're doing,</v>

359
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.611
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>

360
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>the reason why these things is that you know,</v>

361
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>they're right and you don't want to,</v>

362
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to admit that you're doing something goofy.</v>

363
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So you get all butthurt well,</v>

364
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that gets me,</v>

365
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's dope.</v>

366
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>When I slur or someone,</v>

367
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:34.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>may like people on Twitter think they're my friends.</v>

369
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I think there should,</v>

370
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.890
<v Speaker 1>they try.</v>

371
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

372
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

374
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not Norton.</v>

375
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.150

378
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.020

379
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:48.854
