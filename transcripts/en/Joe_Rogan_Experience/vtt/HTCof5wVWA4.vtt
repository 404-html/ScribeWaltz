154
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.850

174
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo on the podcast,</v>

175
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.083
<v Speaker 1>we dropped some knowledge,</v>

176
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>drop some knowledge about weed.</v>

177
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.761
<v Speaker 1>He had a cure up.</v>

178
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.594
<v Speaker 1>Some haters.</v>

179
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this,</v>

180
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately ed,</v>

181
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>he's got some haters online and people make some unfortunate statements and one</v>

182
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:31.891
<v Speaker 1>of those statements was made about him wanting to being a bad role model because</v>

183
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>he says that marijuana enhanced his life and marijuana help does Jujitsu and</v>

184
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>marijuana helps us music and his creativity and some would Jujitsu guy who we</v>

185
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>both respect an amazing Jujitsu guy,</v>

186
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately he's just,</v>

187
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.730
<v Speaker 1>he's got a shitty idea about what weed is.</v>

188
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

189
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I used to be just like you complete.</v>

190
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

191
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I used to hate potheads.</v>

192
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Then how was the,</v>

193
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I was worse than you until I did some research and found out the truth.</v>

194
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You could find out the truth to come $3 just buy in,</v>

195
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.953
<v Speaker 1>buy some books.</v>

196
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Barnes and nobles and they have a whole section on weed and it's</v>

197
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>not negative stuff.</v>

198
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole section on the week.</v>

199
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny because when someone makes a big statement like that and it makes</v>

200
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>a big deal at uh,</v>

201
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

203
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you smoking weed and says you're an idiot man,</v>

204
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

205
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

206
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>they do way more harm for the cause of anti week than they do good.</v>

207
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>because he calling you an idiot.</v>

209
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>All it does is make them look silly and irrational and then it gives you an</v>

210
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to defend yourself.</v>

211
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And then when you defend yourself,</v>

212
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking facts start flying out and information and emotional testimony where</v>

213
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about in your praising the,</v>

214
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the positive effect.</v>

215
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It's way more advertisement for weed.</v>

216
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Every time someone steps up and say something shitty about weed,</v>

217
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the backlash is way bigger now than it's ever been before.</v>

218
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>The move movement actually needs people like called Credo to call us idiots.</v>

219
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause then we bring out the facts and then,</v>

220
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

222
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>the people are on the fence about weed.</v>

223
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

224
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>a good portion of them when presented with a correct fats,</v>

225
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.601
<v Speaker 1>they'll go,</v>

226
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

227
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they'll jump over people way on the other side of the fence.</v>

228
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.580
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to get those guys.</v>

229
00:06:06.581 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Not right now.</v>

230
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>They're too caught in their ways.</v>

231
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

232
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:10.664
<v Speaker 1>I used to be there.</v>

234
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand what their feelings are about drugs fucking up your life</v>

235
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and ruining and becoming a crutch.</v>

236
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>

237
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.241
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

238
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right there.</v>

239
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:19.101
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>

240
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>some drugs can become a crutch.</v>

241
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

242
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>what marijuana is to me and what it is to Eddie is not,</v>

243
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a spiritual thing.</v>

244
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.881
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

245
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

246
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>it's an an theologian.</v>

247
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

248
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it's something that connects you to truth.</v>

249
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something that connects you to a higher feeling of understanding a higher</v>

250
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

251
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.341
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

252
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:37.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.871
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

254
00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to accept the fact that that's bad for you.</v>

255
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I think if used and harnessed correctly,</v>

256
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it's most certainly good for you.</v>

257
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And that if people learned about how good it is for you,</v>

258
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it can enhance their life,</v>

259
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>including cops,</v>

260
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

261
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>including all these people that think it's bad and they think people should go</v>

262
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.174
<v Speaker 1>to jail for it.</v>

263
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It can enhance your life too,</v>

264
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

265
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.101
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

266
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that people should go to jail for it.</v>

267
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

268
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of drugs that are terrible for you.</v>

269
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking right.</v>

270
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of drugs and if you sell them,</v>

271
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you're a piece of shit and you should be removed from society.</v>

272
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

273
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.841
<v Speaker 1>But pots I,</v>

274
00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>one of a man needs thrown in there for the all the wrong reasons and if you look</v>

275
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>at it correctly,</v>

276
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you realize that this is something that makes people happy and it's nature and</v>

277
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it's put here on earth.</v>

278
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>People have had a symbiotic relationship with this plan for 10,000 fucking years</v>

279
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>and the only reason we keep talking about it is because we will get thrown in</v>

280
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>jail for it.</v>

281
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Even though the state says it's legal,</v>

282
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.613
<v Speaker 1>the feds,</v>

283
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.680
<v Speaker 1>the DEA,</v>

284
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

285
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>they think they could just come in and just ignore state law and just put people</v>

286
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>in jail.</v>

287
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm talking about it all the time.</v>

288
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:39.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do my part in the legalization process to open people's eyes once</v>

289
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:41.211
<v Speaker 1>it's totally,</v>

290
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>completely legal and everyone's cool with them and I'm not going to really talk</v>

291
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:45.891
<v Speaker 1>about it no more.</v>

292
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:46.724
<v Speaker 1>There's really no need.</v>

293
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.743
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to know.</v>

294
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.231
<v Speaker 1>It'll be,</v>

295
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>it'll be knowledge.</v>

296
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It be something that's coming.</v>

297
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Understood instead of right now it's commonly misunderstood.</v>

298
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of our marijuana pro program.</v>

299
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Dr 10th Planet J J.</v>

00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Cause they see the shirt.</v>

306
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.981
<v Speaker 2>But it's you,</v>

307
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:10.500
<v Speaker 2>it's you.</v>

311
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.211
<v Speaker 2>You're the first one,</v>

312
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 2>but you're being a regular human being.</v>

313
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:14.841
<v Speaker 2>When you said as you go,</v>

314
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get me one asap.</v>

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.451
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to wear it on fear factor.</v>

317
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I want to wear it on the podcast.</v>

318
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.100
<v Speaker 2>So we rush it.</v>

319
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 2>We get it.</v>

320
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 2>A couple of sets of you,</v>

321
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.700
<v Speaker 2>a couple sentences like other people that we know that are important to us and</v>

322
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 2>you wear it and it fucking blows up.</v>

323
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Like literally blows up.</v>

324
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's nice that I can do that.</v>

325
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Pretty easy.</v>

326
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>So what was going on?</v>

327
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So when you take it,</v>

328
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>when you partake,</v>

329
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 2>partake.</v>

330
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

335
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:40.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad,</v>

336
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 2>massively different podcasts.</v>

337
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

338
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.581
<v Speaker 2>it's different,</v>

339
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:43.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

340
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it's cause it's,</v>

341
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.274
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>well it's also the one,</v>

343
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 2>the only</v>

344
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 1>podcasts or one,</v>

345
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the only ones that I know of where they let you know if they're smoking weed.</v>

346
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith does too.</v>

347
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.720
<v Speaker 1>He smokes weed through his whole posse.</v>

348
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

349
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.641
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

350
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 1>he's the biggest honor I've ever met.</v>

351
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.200
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly what can believe.</v>

352
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.093
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does now.</v>

353
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>He smokes weed all day.</v>

354
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed.</v>

355
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.301
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

356
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 1>We haven't gone,</v>

357
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 2>first time I came in here though,</v>

358
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>you guys were doing the volcano and I did not partake at all,</v>

359
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but I still got high.</v>

360
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.180
<v Speaker 1>We got so lazy with that.</v>

361
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:09.014
<v Speaker 1>Volcanoes.</v>

362
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Volcanoes do its work and it's just way too easy to roll a joint.</v>

363
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I liked the volcano though.</v>

364
00:09:13.671 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It's healthier for your body.</v>

365
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I really should go back to.</v>

366
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

367
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 2>but I was sitting next to it.</v>

368
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting next to it.</v>

369
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It does go through way too fast,</v>

370
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really a problem here in California.</v>

371
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>At least we hope it's not.</v>

372
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It's in 45 days.</v>

373
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.860
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to close all the dispensary's.</v>

374
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>My Guy says it's horse shit.</v>

375
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>He says he's not going anywhere.</v>

376
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:31.190
<v Speaker 1>He says they only gave those things to 16 different people and he said,</v>

377
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:31.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

378
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 1>you get to Michigan.</v>

379
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean they did?</v>

380
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.290
<v Speaker 1>The machine just cleared out Michigan,</v>

381
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 1>all of the medical marijuana,</v>

382
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Michigan and closed down all the fucking that stores,</v>

383
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

384
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been.</v>

385
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.170
<v Speaker 1>People on Twitter have been telling us years.</v>

386
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

387
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.491
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

388
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm all there,</v>

389
00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:44.900
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>

390
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.190
<v Speaker 1>they have a very fresh program.</v>

391
00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.024
<v Speaker 1>It's very young.</v>

392
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.770
<v Speaker 1>California is just so deeply,</v>

393
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:49.581
<v Speaker 1>deeply ingrained.</v>

394
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I doubt that that can happen here.</v>

395
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like trying to close all the McDonald's,</v>

396
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>would take,</v>

398
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>we would find some place we would find the place because all the Mcdonald's you,</v>

399
00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:58.790
<v Speaker 1>but there's one on that corner too.</v>

400
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

401
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:00.411
<v Speaker 1>It's really gross,</v>

402
00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:00.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

403
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

404
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the grossest things about our government,</v>

405
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.710
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they're continually going after marijuana and it's,</v>

406
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence whatsoever that does anything bad and yet to let and</v>

407
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:12.380
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes as slide rather than the table.</v>

408
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.280
<v Speaker 1>The fucking,</v>

409
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 1>the weeds of death.</v>

410
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>These cigarettes are killing 400,000 plus people every year.</v>

411
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And nobody says a word.</v>

412
00:10:19.941 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>They're just sliding on through.</v>

413
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.633
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

414
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.670
<v Speaker 1>everyone's sending jackbooted thugs to go raid medical marijuana dispensaries</v>

415
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>and take all their profits and take all their pot and make them go to court for</v>

416
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>it and never give it back to them and take millions of dollars from them.</v>

417
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.643
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

418
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that these are,</v>

419
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 1>these are basically thugs for pharmaceutical companies.</v>

420
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 1>So speaking of getting high and look at it,</v>

421
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:41.744
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>

422
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>This is a documentary called Kubrick's odyssey by this guy named Jay Wiener,</v>

423
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>who believes that Stanley Kubrick fake the moon landings.</v>

424
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Granted he also believes is an alien base on the moon.</v>

425
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Then he believes that that's the reason why they faked the moon landing since,</v>

426
00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>cause they didn't want to go to the monk cause there's aliens there.</v>

427
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.141
<v Speaker 2>What's the lesson?</v>

428
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Is your beliefs to yourself until you come to the good one?</v>

429
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.273
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

430
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

431
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.453
<v Speaker 2>what's</v>

432
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.260
<v Speaker 1>is the theory is interesting,</v>

433
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but what's,</v>

434
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating about it is he points to the symbolism in,</v>

435
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

436
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:14.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

437
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.131
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

438
00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

439
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>jacket,</v>

440
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.463
<v Speaker 1>the shining,</v>

441
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.990
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism and Stanley Kubrick's version of the shining and how that</v>

442
00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>symbolism directly relates with along with numbers and all sorts of things that</v>

443
00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:27.220
<v Speaker 1>he changed that directly relate to Apollo,</v>

444
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.540
<v Speaker 1>to the Apollo Moon landings,</v>

445
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.310
<v Speaker 1>including the room,</v>

446
00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:34.660
<v Speaker 1>the crazy room where everything happened is the exact amount of distance between</v>

447
00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:35.650
<v Speaker 1>the earth and the moon.</v>

448
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

449
00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and then he changed it from what it is in the book and made it the distance to</v>

450
00:11:40.331 --> 00:11:41.164
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

451
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:41.810
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

453
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and then there's all this symbolism like the boy is wearing that.</v>

454
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And Apollo a rocket sweater in this one particular scene,</v>

455
00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not doing it any justice.</v>

456
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

457
00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:56.731
<v Speaker 1>very detailed and it also detailed about the way that he believes they faked the</v>

458
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>videos of people on the moon but I think called front screen projection,</v>

459
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.300
<v Speaker 1>which was a technique that Kubrick used in 2001 and in this technique is not</v>

460
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:06.971
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>

461
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:09.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically the beginning of green screens.</v>

462
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 1>What they did before they invented green screen and this,</v>

463
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>this technique has a telltale like sort of a line between the boundaries of the</v>

464
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 1>real front,</v>

465
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the real screen or the real stage rather.</v>

467
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And then the screen behind it,</v>

468
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>which is an image which tries to make it electric,</v>

469
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a vast distance when in reality it's just a wall.</v>

470
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And this telltale line,</v>

471
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.370
<v Speaker 1>he shows it all is a pallet photos.</v>

472
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really kind of crazy if you,</v>

473
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.461
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it,</v>

474
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you look at the videos,</v>

475
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>look at the photos and you know the stills of the astronauts bouncing around the</v>

476
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:39.060
<v Speaker 1>moon,</v>

477
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

478
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that looks exactly like that.</v>

479
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

480
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

481
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.900
<v Speaker 1>To couple that with the fact that the same background exists in different Apollo</v>

482
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>moon landing missions and their background where they're supposed to be miles</v>

483
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.164
<v Speaker 1>away from each other.</v>

484
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be in a completely different place,</v>

485
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have the same background as the price of discrepancies about</v>

486
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the imagery and what he believes.</v>

487
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>He believes that people actually went to the boom,</v>

488
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but when they got there,</v>

489
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the problem was there was aliens there and he points to the clementine lunar</v>

490
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:07.691
<v Speaker 1>orbiter,</v>

491
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>which took photographs of uh,</v>

492
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:14.321
<v Speaker 1>a crater and this crater had a very distinct like blue dome in it,</v>

494
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 1>take it on the grant of salt.</v>

496
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting just to watch people go deep into the rabbit hole.</v>

497
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.211
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

498
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>This guy must suspend a giant chunk of his life trying to prove that Stanley</v>

499
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick fake the moon landings.</v>

500
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.451
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting,</v>

501
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

502
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Might be a hundred percent horseshit.</v>

503
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.193
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

504
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Here's the whole thing.</v>

505
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking the whole time he told me that extended qubit fake to the moon</v>

506
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 1>landings don't you think can be pitching so much other fake shit like guys,</v>

507
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>let's also fake this and like why would he go to make movies?</v>

508
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

509
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I think what the idea is is that the government accordingly with his hypothesis</v>

510
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>is that the government wanted to fake the moon landings.</v>

511
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 1>And what they did was they came to Kubrick,</v>

512
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 1>they explained to him why they want to fake the moon landings and they gave him</v>

513
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 1>access to all sorts of scientific information.</v>

514
00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And cubic is a mathematical genius and he was obsessed with space flight and it</v>

515
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>was really like really,</v>

516
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:05.554
<v Speaker 1>really into that shit.</v>

517
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And so what they did was they gave him access to all of NASA's different studies</v>

518
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and NASA is different,</v>

519
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:13.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

520
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:18.601
<v Speaker 1>technology and allowed him to have like basically an unlimited budget to produce</v>

521
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 1>this and to produce 2001 a space odyssey.</v>

522
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>So you could do them sort of in conjunction with each other and the technology</v>

523
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>that he could use and portraying 2001 he can use it basically the same stuff</v>

524
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.411
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

525
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:29.671
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

526
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>and faking the movement headaches and they would help him get him rich and give</v>

527
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>them access to information.</v>

528
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

529
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>this guy's take on it is the access to information was uh,</v>

530
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>the elites of society.</v>

531
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:39.980
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

532
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the hidden,</v>

533
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>culture that runs the hidden societies that run our government for real.</v>

535
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

536
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

537
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>the privileged few like an eyes wide shut and we know that like was talking to</v>

538
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the skull and bones as long as weird fucking groups.</v>

539
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Somebody Shit heads get into at the Bohemian Grove.</v>

540
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that stuff?</v>

541
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>We're all these elites from all over the world and me and his son,</v>

542
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:07.170
<v Speaker 1>they fucking sacrifice in effigy and they worship this mold left the owl God.</v>

543
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones has a whole video where he snuck into Bohemian Grove and filmed all</v>

544
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:12.284
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

545
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.683
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>

546
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>What's all,</v>

547
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 1>what else is interesting is that when he made the movie eyes wide shut,</v>

548
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that was his last movie.</v>

549
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.570
<v Speaker 1>That movie was sort of about a lot of it was about like hidden society.</v>

550
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like secret societies shut up.</v>

551
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

552
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.403
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind of,</v>

553
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.551
<v Speaker 1>he was a brilliant,</v>

554
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:28.971
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

555
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy and he was also a brilliant chess player.</v>

556
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>And what they think is that he did it was like he hit a lot of things,</v>

557
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 1>symbolism and,</v>

558
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:37.881
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

559
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.660
<v Speaker 1>in different imagery in,</v>

560
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>in the movie to sort of tell a story.</v>

561
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 1>And this guy breaks it down.</v>

562
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.671
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

563
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

564
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>it's hypothesis.</v>

565
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It could be a hundred percent horse shift.</v>

566
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting.</v>

568
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>So see it or not,</v>

569
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

570
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.803

<v Speaker 1>I think I got to donate to the little bit of comedy store.</v>

628
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.463
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

629
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.810
<v Speaker 1>As we look at those attachments,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people break those dose and no one will ever donate it.</v>

631
00:17:22.151 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Then once fucks it,</v>

632

668
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I've get that.</v>

669
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I get when there's a dispensary,</v>

670
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 1>if near a neighborhood and you buy something you want to like go around the</v>

671
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:15.594
<v Speaker 1>corner and smoke.</v>

672
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm like I don't want to smoke or for something.</v>

673
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.593
<v Speaker 1>Somebodies yard.</v>

674
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

675
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:18.803
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem.</v>

676
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

677
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>That is the problem.</v>

678
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.031
<v Speaker 1>That is the problem.</v>

680
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when it's too near residential or can your school,</v>

681
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>some people want to argue with that.</v>

682
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:30.771
<v Speaker 1>I was real close to the drug store to school but also not really that close and</v>

683
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 1>people aren't doing stuff there.</v>

684
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:32.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

685
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.391
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

686
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And very few people are in a drug store anywhere on Ventura Boulevard.</v>

687
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that cause they might,</v>

688
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a lot of people that get their prescriptions and just fucking Jack</v>

689
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.060
<v Speaker 1>right in the parking lot and know failing an oxycontin thing probably.</v>

690
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Actually that's really normal.</v>

691
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:47.220
<v Speaker 1>They pop those bitches.</v>

693
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Could anywhere material and he's busy street.</v>

694
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:49.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

695
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:50.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

696
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

697
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.353
<v Speaker 1>That's totally fine.</v>

698
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Malls should have punch ups.</v>

699
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 1>They should.</v>

700
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

701
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.523
<v Speaker 1>those fucks.</v>

702
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to make a fortune putting a pot shop in the mall.</v>

703
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>

704
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>are you going to make a fortunate that someday?</v>

705
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry about this backlash?</v>

706
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 1>All the shit that's going on right now,</v>

707
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to close pot stores.</v>

708
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it gets,</v>

709
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it gets to be really inflammatory that people send a good closing shops left and</v>

710
00:19:10.781 --> 00:19:10.971
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

711
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:11.251
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

712
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.084
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

713
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>The only news I really heard is they're sending out 16 letters and they're</v>

714
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>shutting down.</v>

715
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>They're giving those 16 stores 45 days and make no arrests,</v>

716
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>45 days shut down.</v>

717
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.850
<v Speaker 1>And only 16 out of the thousands that are,</v>

718
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.220
<v Speaker 1>you know that story when they came to me there was no one left.</v>

719
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

720
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.203
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

721
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Speaker 1>But like I don't know exactly why and what they mean when they say not operating</v>

722
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 1>in the state laws.</v>

723
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Well you're,</v>

725
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you have a real good point about people.</v>

726
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm reactionary.</v>

727
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 1>There's one where like the end is near or at worst that too,</v>

728
00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 1>but also a what you were talking about how they're supposed to be nonprofit.</v>

729
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

730
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.340
<v Speaker 1>none of them are nonprofit out there making crazy cash.</v>

731
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>They have employees that you'd like that.</v>

732
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:50.491
<v Speaker 1>I get that,</v>

733
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but it would change the real change if you know,</v>

734
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Paul was fucking afraid.</v>

735
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

736
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the real change.</v>

737
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Or if you only paid enough to my rowing</v>

738
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.020
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>

739
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

740
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.061
<v Speaker 1>if I was free,</v>

741
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that would be the real change.</v>

742
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's everybody just had pot and you just gave people things for pot was like</v>

743
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:12.561
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a weird barter system or you got paid to grow pot just enough so</v>

744
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:13.494
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

745
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:20:13.891 --> 00:20:15.640
<v Speaker 1>would you be able to get it around?</v>

747
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It's really good to the supermarket.</v>

748
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

749
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

750
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Why not just come by?</v>

751
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you could get paid just enough to justify you growing it,</v>

752
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't get Bentley money.</v>

753
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.261
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

754
00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:29.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to get somebody going to run the whole dispensary pay the</v>

755
00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>more they don't just get just enough to get by.</v>

756
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Well that's part of this whole thing that's like a hundred grand a year.</v>

757
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.161
<v Speaker 1>That's a business.</v>

758
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the person that's running it.</v>

759
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

760
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 1>What about the profit for the actual business itself?</v>

761
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 1>How much whatever you want to make with a regular business.</v>

762
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much it's a nightmare.</v>

763
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.190
<v Speaker 1>President of Nike made a shit load.</v>

764
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

765
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 1>he should.</v>

766
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>She started Nike.</v>

767
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:48.611
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

768
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And you make a slippery slope,</v>

769
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:50.531
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

770
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Once you give up anything when it's really not for profit,</v>

771
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 1>what's for what purpose anyway,</v>

772
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 1>but the way it's written,</v>

773
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:57.700
<v Speaker 1>it is I think any medical drug,</v>

774
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 1>it's for profit.</v>

775
00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

776
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So like what is this nonprofit?</v>

777
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess the idea is to protect the people problem the first place.</v>

778
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

779
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but they are there.</v>

780
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

781
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>But tomatoes aren't like profitable the way marijuana is probably the wrong and</v>

782
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not patentable.</v>

783
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And since it's a psychoactive substance,</v>

784
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I think they feel like anything psychoactive they have to control.</v>

785
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

786
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

787
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 1>if they have some things that are psychoactive that they control,</v>

789
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:21.990
<v Speaker 1>if other ones they don't control it,</v>

790
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe get a little testy about that shit.</v>

791
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I think pharmaceutical companies would get testy about it.</v>

792
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they put a lot of pressure on politicians and that's where all the shit</v>

793
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

794
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.391
<v Speaker 1>It's a direct,</v>

795
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not a result of the people.</v>

796
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a White House website.</v>

797
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:35.160
<v Speaker 1>We can uh,</v>

798
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>asking,</v>

799
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>what was your question is the most important?</v>

801
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Quit number one by far is why isn't it marijuana legal?</v>

802
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.461
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>

803
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:42.701
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

804
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.690
<v Speaker 1>quit oppressing me.</v>

805
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:43.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

806
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:44.561
<v Speaker 1>this bothers,</v>

807
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 1>nobody bothers nobody around me.</v>

808
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So like stop,</v>

809
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone.</v>

810
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing anything to anyone.</v>

811
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

812
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>me knees,</v>

813
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 1>government meanies cut that shit out.</v>

814
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Yo were hip to you.</v>

815
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.120
<v Speaker 1>We know it's done it.</v>

816
00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 1>We're all just people stupid.</v>

817
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Get it together because it's something in ice water and stay black.</v>

818
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Trussell to fisting with flashlights,</v>

819
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Uno jokes.</v>

820
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.660
<v Speaker 1>One of them is going to stuff up as,</v>

821
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:14.381
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>

822
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 1>now that's not the proper use of these things.</v>

823
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 1>These are sex tools,</v>

824
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 1>not sex toys.</v>

825
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:19.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

826
00:22:19.801 --> 00:22:19.981
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

827
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:20.160
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

828
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 1>we've got rid that today.</v>

829
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bit in that sex tools,</v>

830
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.103
<v Speaker 1>not toys,</v>

831
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 1>toys and a purpose.</v>

832
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>They just don't do any open up for me.</v>

833
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill my fleshlight material.</v>

834
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

835
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.363
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

836
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Which one is 10 minutes on the flush letting you do that shit.</v>

837
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>What's this one model act?</v>

838
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Exact same video as we did last time you were here.</v>

839
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I gave him a flashlight to what happens?</v>

840
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Women throw them out.</v>

841
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

842
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Flashlights laying around your house.</v>

844
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Chicks fine and they go with Fuck Dunkin.</v>

845
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 1>They need to make it.</v>

846
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>They need to make it safe.</v>

847
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Special fleshlight safe with the code and it looks like a golf club.</v>

848
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

849
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like something that wouldn't throw out.</v>

850
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to put a Paki in its pocket and it's,</v>

851
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 1>he puts Siri in it and then not have it be like a voice to your flesh.</v>

852
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.950
<v Speaker 1>So you talk to your flashlight.</v>

853
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Tell me I'm good.</v>

854
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh baby,</v>

855
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sucking your cock.</v>

856
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I bet they will have that.</v>

857
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll have like to,</v>

858
00:23:20.461 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 1>they don't leave an iPhone sleeve for your flashlight.</v>

859
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they just put headphones on.</v>

860
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

861
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and you can actually even watch a video too.</v>

862
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>You could have it hooked up to an Ipad as well.</v>

863
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>So you're watching a porno video on the IPAD.</v>

864
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you know they have a Chinese,</v>

865
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

866
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Dick Sucking robot.</v>

867
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Speaker 1>They came in with a robot.</v>

868
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.080
<v Speaker 1>They call it like a seaman extraction device,</v>

869
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially like this tall and feel like a tube and it sucks in your</v>

870
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

871
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.330
<v Speaker 1>That's probably horrendously rude.</v>

872
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Ten five feels terrible.</v>

873
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.403
<v Speaker 1>But they have it.</v>

874
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Course.</v>

875
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised they don't.</v>

876
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised it blow job robotics hasn't isn't like a huge industry.</v>

877
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

878
00:23:58.041 --> 00:23:59.520
<v Speaker 1>the Siri thing is going to change all that.</v>

879
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing,</v>

880
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I think so everyone wants to fuck Syria like so many of my friends want to fuck.</v>

881
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what Brian wants.</v>

882
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Syrian.</v>

883
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 2>It's his voice.</v>

884
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

886
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.823
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs,</v>

887
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.341
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

888
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 2>I think the logical thing is to change the voice.</v>

889
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.281
<v Speaker 2>The Steve Jobs,</v>

890
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 2>since he died like one week before Siri was announced or released.</v>

891
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be a robot voice?</v>

893
00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Can you adjust the voice that he died the day after it was announced?</v>

894
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

895
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.630
<v Speaker 1>The day after he missed.</v>

896
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.580
<v Speaker 1>That was the first speech that he never gave the keynote speech or whatever it</v>

897
00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:29.791
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

898
00:24:29.791 --> 00:24:33.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever big announcement speech Kim Cook Tim Cook did and then he died.</v>

899
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 2>They have different voices in different countries,</v>

900
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 2>so they have a like an Australian voice and a British voters.</v>

901
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

902
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

903
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>but I guess they don't work as good like because he doesn't understand your</v>

904
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 2>accent and words like languages,</v>

905
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 2>like Australians,</v>

906
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 2>like say pubs or whatever they say.</v>

907
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:49.611
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

908
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:49.871
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

909
00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

910
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 2>They have a bunch of different shit going on.</v>

911
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

912
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you're obsessed with that,</v>

913
00:24:53.581 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

914
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:54.703
<v Speaker 2>You're obsessed with Siri.</v>

915
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to play with.</v>

916
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.533
<v Speaker 2>I want to get it.</v>

917
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

918
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.203
<v Speaker 1>I want one too,</v>

919
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but you have a droid fucking me,</v>

920
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:01.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

921
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing my words now.</v>

922
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.633
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

923
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I love the Troy.</v>

924
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.821
<v Speaker 1>What happens,</v>

925
00:25:05.821 --> 00:25:09.700
<v Speaker 1>how you're telling me it's the most amazing fun of all time and I went around</v>

926
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and I fucking razzed iPhone owners and I'm like the droids batter,</v>

927
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.650
<v Speaker 1>but it sucks,</v>

928
00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:14.861
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

929
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like they did a software update,</v>

930
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.960
<v Speaker 1>so now it's gone back to like an ancient voicemail from months ago.</v>

931
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I just decided to do that random times.</v>

932
00:25:23.681 --> 00:25:28.681
<v Speaker 1>Pandora will turn on at random fucking times and also it reconfigured my address</v>

933
00:25:28.901 --> 00:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>book so I have problems finding phone numbers.</v>

934
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:31.991
<v Speaker 1>It was a software up.</v>

935
00:25:31.991 --> 00:25:32.650
<v Speaker 1>They fucked,</v>

936
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.350
<v Speaker 1>fucked everything.</v>

937
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that software update.</v>

938
00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Once a blackberry killed all my numbers.</v>

939
00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I lost every number in my fucking phone.</v>

940
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 1>There were all garbled jumble and half of them were missing.</v>

941
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

942
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.610
<v Speaker 1>they're just gone.</v>

943
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:42.941
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

944
00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:43.780
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

945
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I had to let go back to my computer and start from scratch.</v>

946
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I had a backup.</v>

947
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

948
00:25:48.361 --> 00:25:49.194
<v Speaker 1>they're done dude.</v>

949
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 1>They have nothing there.</v>

950
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>They have these little stupid devices with buttons on them.</v>

951
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.441
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

952
00:25:53.441 --> 00:25:55.060
<v Speaker 1>When the new iPhone comes out,</v>

953
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.700
<v Speaker 1>they are surface drops out or what?</v>

954
00:25:57.701 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 1>A disaster.</v>

955
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.181
<v Speaker 1>His ass or,</v>

956
00:25:59.181 --> 00:25:59.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

957
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.300
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not just the iPhone anymore.</v>

958
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>

959
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>That droid bionic now.</v>

960
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

961
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I saw what somebody had one of those other shows weekend.</v>

962
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking amazing phone.</v>

963
00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:08.620
<v Speaker 1>What does he do in the camera?</v>

964
00:26:08.621 --> 00:26:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

965
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.500
<v Speaker 1>The camera has so many different options</v>

966
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.153
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

967
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.040
<v Speaker 2>New iPhone beat them all works better,</v>

968
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:15.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

969
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:15.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

970
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything text on its face detection as cropping.</v>

971
00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:20.740
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>

972
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have that 4.5 inch screen though,</v>

973
00:26:22.751 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

974
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

975
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.961
<v Speaker 2>that big ass.</v>

976
00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:26.830
<v Speaker 2>You know why they did a report of why,</v>

977
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.230
<v Speaker 2>you know the iPhone isn't gone to that yet,</v>

978
00:26:29.231 --> 00:26:32.800
<v Speaker 2>is that the screen is a certain size of screen that once it gets too big,</v>

979
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.450
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it one handed anymore.</v>

980
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.720
<v Speaker 2>You have to hold with two hands and that's the size of the iPhone to actually be</v>

981
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.180
<v Speaker 2>the biggest it usually can get for the average person.</v>

982
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.050
<v Speaker 2>So that makes sense.</v>

983
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:41.980
<v Speaker 2>That totally makes sense.</v>

984
00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also a battery life</v>

985
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.401
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

986
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:44.641
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

987

988
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 1>those droids battery lives are always out of juice.</v>

989

<v Speaker 1>My droids.</v>

1006
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 1>An agent that you weren't talented.</v>

1007
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>What kind of car you gotta get?</v>

1008
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get a car?</v>

1009

1011
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.530

1012
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.941
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1013
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1014
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that when I finally do get that fucking car,</v>

1015
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a long conversation.</v>

1016
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you that helped me pick one out or something.</v>

1017
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of car when I can't,</v>

1018
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a car guy.</v>

1019
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.433
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1020
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1021
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1022
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 1>was a mini Cooper too expensive?</v>

1023
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that was the deal with that?</v>

1024
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like the one that you have for while the lease expired?</v>

1025
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Those are good cars though.</v>

1026
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Why not just get one of those?</v>

1027
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Because they're a,</v>

1028
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.321
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it.</v>

1029
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to love mini coopers and this sounds so weird and maybe,</v>

1030
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to say it,</v>

1031
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:53.841
<v Speaker 1>but like I think like a really nice comfortable fucking like car driving through</v>

1032
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 1>traffic freaks me out.</v>

1033
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Driving through traffic in La makes me think it's the end of the world.</v>

1034
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel like having nervous breakdowns,</v>

1035
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you look at it all these fucking shitty vans and then you feel like you're right</v>

1036
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>at the first episode of the walking dead.</v>

1037
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's about to fall apart.</v>

1038
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:12.970
<v Speaker 1>So I want some kind of giant comfort bubble.</v>

1039
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Like Ford Edge.</v>

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>it looks all right looking for a movie tonight.</v>

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I just have you seen drive?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

1128
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So she has a little bit of a problem with extreme violence.</v>

1129
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one to watch and mixed company.</v>

1130
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Now if I was with my friends,</v>

1131
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:18.724
<v Speaker 1>probably enjoyed it more.</v>

1132
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 1>What did I see last night?</v>

1133
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I saw the um,</v>

1134
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the tower heist with Eddie Murphy.</v>

1135
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.913
<v Speaker 1>How was that?</v>

1136
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It was okay.</v>

1137
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I had pretty next to nothing expectations and I enjoyed the movie.</v>

1138
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.721
<v Speaker 2>Like I enjoyed it.</v>

1139
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It's Eddie Murphy back to dropping f bombs and being Eddie Murphy and they still</v>

1140
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>are not playing Ben Stiller.</v>

1141
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 2>He playing a little bit different of a role,</v>

1142
00:30:35.261 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>which is nice and it's a lot of corporate groups about the corporate guys</v>

1143
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 2>fucking do a little more little suckers.</v>

1144
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And then it turns into like a family friendly comedy at the end.</v>

1145
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:43.534
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

1146
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty sweet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're not reaching a healthy dose of a tin foil hat is sometimes a good thing.</v>

1155
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever sat down with Alex Jones?</v>

1156
00:31:06.361 --> 00:31:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had him on your show?</v>

1157
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:07.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1158
00:31:07.631 --> 00:31:07.991
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1159
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:08.681
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted out,</v>

1160
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to interview him and I tweeted out one of his articles and,</v>

1161
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>and he was such a polarizing character that the backlash from tweeting that out</v>

1162
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 2>made people not want to listen to the message I was trying to give.</v>

1163
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a little reluctant from that,</v>

1164
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1165
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but what I have seen from him at times is this so far,</v>

1166
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.774
<v Speaker 2>pretty interesting to me.</v>

1167
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 1>What about if I had him come on or as a podcast?</v>

1168
00:31:25.271 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you would be the perfect counterpoint.</v>

1169
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Would you sit in and have us off podcast?</v>

1170
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to.</v>

1171

1176
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is softening up the idea.</v>

1177
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.660
<v Speaker 3>It's attack gets attack of the show.</v>

1194
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1195
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to hang with them,</v>

1196
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.600
<v Speaker 1>but Joey Diaz gave him a pot cookie and put them on the fucking moon.</v>

1197
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:15.463
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1198
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.351
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly.</v>

1199
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly.</v>

1200
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 3>He actually said on a show the next day that he has smoked pot with me once a</v>

1201
00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:25.230
<v Speaker 3>year just to try it out and see if I'm in the decriminalization.</v>

1202
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.671
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

1203
00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Good</v>

1204
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.311
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>

1205
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:28.144
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1206
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1207
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.081
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1208
00:32:29.081 --> 00:32:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Once a year I come into town and I get,</v>

1209
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1210
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.050
<v Speaker 2>we could smoke a little weed.</v>

1211
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1212
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>

1213
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.440
<v Speaker 2>does the polarizing nature of his character concern you in terms of aligning</v>

1214
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:37.870
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

1215
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1216
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm it much who I am.</v>

1217
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody has any questions,</v>

1218
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:42.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody who knows me,</v>

1220
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 1>they know me from the podcast.</v>

1221
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1222
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to,</v>

1223
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's confusing.</v>

1224
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I find a lot of what he says fascinating and I don't buy into all of it,</v>

1225
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but I to buy into something of it.</v>

1226
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great video on what we're talking about tonight,</v>

1227
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>but provoca tourists or,</v>

1228

1233
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.720
<v Speaker 1>the WTO protests in Seattle and uh,</v>

1234
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 1>how it was set up where these military people would come in and it caused</v>

1235
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 1>violence and they were wearing like ski masks and Shit.</v>

1236
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 1>They were breaking windows,</v>

1237
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.390
<v Speaker 1>they were wearing fucking military issue boots and they want up getting,</v>

1238
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>they want of going into a safe house and then they get a,</v>

1239
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.441
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1240
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 1>the cops negotiate with them and they let them all go.</v>

1241
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

1243
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:22.671
<v Speaker 1>it's so gross.</v>

1244
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 1>He documents it in great detail.</v>

1245
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.920
<v Speaker 2>There's videos from occupy where,</v>

1246
00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:26.760
<v Speaker 2>where people are in the crowd,</v>

1247
00:33:26.761 --> 00:33:27.301
<v Speaker 2>they're screaming,</v>

1248
00:33:27.301 --> 00:33:29.340
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to rile up the people in the frontline as they're approaching the</v>

1249
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:29.970
<v Speaker 2>riot cops.</v>

1250
00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.360
<v Speaker 2>The riot cops step aside after telling people you can not go down the street.</v>

1251
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.120
<v Speaker 2>And a line of eight of them walks right on through the police line.</v>

1252
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Then they close up and not arrested the dudes that walk on by,</v>

1253
00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:40.740
<v Speaker 2>but they look like plain clothes protestors.</v>

1254
00:33:40.741 --> 00:33:41.820
<v Speaker 2>That's already happened.</v>

1255
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.680
<v Speaker 2>It's already happened.</v>

1256
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.990
<v Speaker 2>The what is the justification?</v>

1257
00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:49.470
<v Speaker 2>How do they sleep at night knowing that they're doing that kind of shit and just</v>

1258
00:33:49.471 --> 00:33:50.071
<v Speaker 2>doing that job,</v>

1259
00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:50.370
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1260
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.440
<v Speaker 2>that's like Nazi Germany Shit,</v>

1261
00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:52.651
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1262
00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:53.311
<v Speaker 2>That's like Earl.</v>

1263
00:33:53.311 --> 00:33:53.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1264
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:53.811
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1265
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:54.101
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1266
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:54.351
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1267
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:59.160
<v Speaker 2>it's creepy that you can get an American citizen to trick other American</v>

1268
00:33:59.161 --> 00:34:00.030
<v Speaker 2>citizens like that.</v>

1269
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.133
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1270
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 2>we talked about desensitization.</v>

1271
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:03.443
<v Speaker 2>They don't see,</v>

1272
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 2>they don't see Americans.</v>

1273
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't see you and I potentially,</v>

1274
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they see dog.</v>

1275
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.320
<v Speaker 2>They see rabid dogs who are uneducated and hippies and x,</v>

1276
00:34:10.321 --> 00:34:10.801
<v Speaker 2>y and z.</v>

1277
00:34:10.801 --> 00:34:12.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what they see and they're just getting their paycheck.</v>

1278
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.930
<v Speaker 2>They're just motherfuckers see were riled up again.</v>

1279
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1280
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.570
<v Speaker 2>this is the time clutching flashlights and health of brain,</v>

1281
00:34:18.571 --> 00:34:21.060
<v Speaker 2>so clearly I'm in the right minds or credibility.</v>

1282
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Clearly I'm in the riots.</v>

1283
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Substantially undermines your credibility.</v>

00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:36.481
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>

1304
00:34:36.481 --> 00:34:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Perera should have it spelled like career,</v>

1305
00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:39.670
<v Speaker 2>like Porsche went through days.</v>

1306
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Carrera Perrera.</v>

1307
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Is it Portuguese?</v>

1308
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't look it up.</v>

1310
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.553
<v Speaker 2>What the guests,</v>

1311
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.700
<v Speaker 2>how do you say it in Portuguese you got say it with a mouthful of bread and</v>

1312
00:34:47.701 --> 00:34:49.610
<v Speaker 2>angrily then it's Portuguese.</v>

1313
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.950
<v Speaker 2>That's only once you get for tie down.</v>

1314
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.860
<v Speaker 2>A mouthful of octopus soup is regularly different than Brazilian Portuguese.</v>

1315
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it a different way of pronouncing things?</v>

1316
00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:58.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1317
00:34:58.621 --> 00:34:59.101
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

1318
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:00.400
<v Speaker 2>there's like a region,</v>

1319
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.710
<v Speaker 2>regional dialects and whatnot,</v>

1320
00:35:01.711 --> 00:35:03.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's still fundamentally the same language.</v>

1321
00:35:03.451 --> 00:35:04.410
<v Speaker 2>It just put a little spin on it.</v>

1322
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Brazil is so strange,</v>
