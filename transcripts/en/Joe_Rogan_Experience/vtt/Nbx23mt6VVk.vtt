<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling the baby.</v>

41
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 2>If you want to come back in 30 minutes ago because I'm really thirsty.</v>

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.671
<v Speaker 2>That's a tactic.</v>

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.534
<v Speaker 2>Hold on one second.</v>

50
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.373
<v Speaker 2>I close the door.</v>

51
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>My wife is from Tennessee.</v>

52
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 2>She saves those fucking bottles and fills up with water and takes them through</v>

53
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:10.441
<v Speaker 2>yoga.</v>

58
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:13.831
<v Speaker 2>Once that done,</v>

59
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.664

<v Speaker 2>my wife says him and puts them in the freezer for headaches and shit,</v>

61
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 2>so I wanted to get one of those and there was no bottles,</v>

62
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 2>so I give her a glass of water.</v>

63
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>She takes off.</v>

64
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm running against the clock.</v>

65
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>These three little more than bitches are going to come back.</v>

66
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>My wife walks in and let me go outside and get an,</v>

67
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you know they stole my pipe.</v>

68
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 2>When they asked me to get the water,</v>

69
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 2>they stole my pot pipe from the balcony.</v>

70
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else was on that balcony.</v>

71
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 2>The water got comes on that balcony and he sees the pipe.</v>

72
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't leave without that.</v>

73
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that stupid.</v>

74
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I just lead the pipe cleaner.</v>

75
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.763
<v Speaker 2>The pipe,</v>

76
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.821
<v Speaker 2>the fucking.</v>

77
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 2>My wife was there and one came,</v>

78
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the lady who takes care of mercy,</v>

79
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>they didn't steal a fucking.</v>

80
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 2>The Mormons stole my pipe.</v>

81
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.441
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

82
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I got in that car and hunted those three little cock eyed bitches down all over.</v>

83
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:56.431
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find them.</v>

84
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 2>They never came back.</v>

85
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 2>They stole my pot pipe.</v>

86
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they stole it because they were just stealing things or do you</v>

87
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 2>think they stole it because they didn't want you to be engaging in such horrible</v>

88
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.154
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>

89
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Smoking marijuana when you're taking care of your child.</v>

90
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't smoking when I was taking care of the child.</v>

91
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I just always leave it out there.</v>

92
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It's always.</v>

93
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 2>That's how I mean.</v>

94
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you have one,</v>

95
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:16.914
<v Speaker 2>you have a child,</v>

96
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 2>but he's still smoking marijuana.</v>

97
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Like how dare you?</v>

98
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing with a pot pipe out.</v>

99
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 2>We need to take this from him.</v>

100
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.191
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they took it,</v>

101
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but if they smoked and cocked,</v>

102
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 2>know that two bitches ain't shit that had holes in her feet and the shoes on</v>

103
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>what religion.</v>

104
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Since people are knocking on doors,</v>

105
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm memorial day that's guaranteed.</v>

106
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Slammed the door to the face.</v>

107
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Then you have another one that you kept.</v>

108
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>He kept coming back.</v>

109
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

110
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I had a job or witness.</v>

111
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:43.944
<v Speaker 2>I was stringing him out.</v>

112
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Made a bad time to come back in an hour and see him lurking in front of my</v>

113
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:50.621
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

114
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even go home.</v>

115
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even go behind him and strung out for like four months though.</v>

116
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Every time he'd come over,</v>

117
00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what I really want to talk to you.</v>

118
00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Give me those pamphlets.</v>

119
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I called the number you would think maybe starting from your basic know your</v>

120
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 3>zero set point of just,</v>

121
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

122
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>now we're going to reboot civilization.</v>

123
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.663
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

124
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 3>you would think that if you had this kind of process,</v>

125
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.910
<v Speaker 3>each candidate would be more impressive than the next man.</v>

126
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

127
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe each.</v>

128
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Each person who came to the podium,</v>

129
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.343
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

130
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.383
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

131
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.921
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>

132
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like the dunk contest,</v>

133
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

134
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.931
<v Speaker 3>for the NBA.</v>

135
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

136
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.093
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

137
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I could just.</v>

138
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 3>When you thought you saw the best dunk in your life,</v>

139
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

140
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 3>the next guy comes along.</v>

141
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And it would be that.</v>

142
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 3>It would be that on every topic,</v>

143
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

144
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like you'd be talking about the science of climate change.</v>

145
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:44.400
<v Speaker 3>You'd be talking about the actual dynamics of the war on terror,</v>

146
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 3>so topics that seem to have no relationship where you would have to be.</v>

147
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 3>You'd be amazed that anyone could be an expert in all of them.</v>

148
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 3>You would find someone who is an expert,</v>

149
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 3>a functional expert in all of them.</v>

150
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Pretty winter,</v>

151
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

152
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

153
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

154
00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

155
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

156
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 3>but someone who is also ethically wise who does wasn't just,</v>

157
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 3>wasn't obviously an asshole.</v>

158
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.883
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

159
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.600
<v Speaker 3>and who,</v>

160
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

161
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

162
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.813
<v Speaker 3>who had a,</v>

163
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
<v Speaker 3>a mature relationship to change in his or her mind.</v>

164
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.481
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

165
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 3>So like this whole bit about flip flopping and,</v>

166
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

167
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.093
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

168
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

169
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 3>being someone who could honestly represent changes of mind in,</v>

170
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

171
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 3>across a political career.</v>

172
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

173
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

174
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.791
<v Speaker 3>it's nowhere written.</v>

175
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 3>That is a good thing to believe today,</v>

176
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 3>what you believe 20 years ago.</v>

177
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:35.141
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

178
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 3>if you do that on every topic,</v>

179
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 3>it means basically you haven't been in dialogue with the world.</v>

180
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

181
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 3>but there's something,</v>

182
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 3>it's so taboo to change your mind that either you have to lie about it or you</v>

183
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 3>have to pretend it was a,</v>

184
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 3>it was always that way,</v>

185
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 3>or um,</v>

186
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.941
<v Speaker 3>it's just a,</v>

187
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

188
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm an assistant,</v>

189
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 3>yet the system is,</v>

190
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 3>is broken in that respect,</v>

191
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 3>but given the choices,</v>

192
00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 3>and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws,</v>

194
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 3>been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of</v>

195
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 3>compromise and capable of,</v>

196
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.461
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

197
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 3>not just,</v>

198
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

199
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.863
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

200
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.833
<v Speaker 3>breaking</v>

201
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 3>the entire machine and you have someone who's just,</v>

202
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.080
<v Speaker 3>he could just kinda stepped off the set of his reality TV show and then a lied</v>

203
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 3>about everything and,</v>

204
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

205
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and elbowed his way onto your television set and never left because,</v>

206
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 3>CNN couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else.</v>

208
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

209
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

210
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

211
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

212
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 3>he's a product of attention because they realized that there's a heated race,</v>

213
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.621
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

214
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:48.321
<v Speaker 3>The heated race.</v>

215
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 3>This guy was really famous and in a heated race,</v>

216
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 3>this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune into um,</v>

217
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 3>so everybody had to do an intro.</v>

218
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 3>So because of him saying crazy stuff,</v>

219
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 3>he accelerated the amount they were talking about them.</v>

220
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 3>So they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people</v>

221
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.793
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

222
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 3>but he's created a worm hole in our political process now where there's nothing</v>

223
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 3>so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who like him to.</v>

224
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:17.021
<v Speaker 3>So he can just keep it just like nuclear bombs of craziness that the press can't</v>

225
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.080
<v Speaker 3>ignore that the,</v>

226
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 3>every time they think,</v>

227
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.471
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

228
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 3>this is the crazy thing he said that's going to harm his candidacy,</v>

229
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 3>so let's shine a light on it.</v>

230
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.043
<v Speaker 3>It just helps him,</v>

231
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

232
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 3>he could just,</v>

233
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>he could,</v>

234
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 3>he could.</v>

235
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get on twitter right now and say,</v>

236
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 3>you know who I'd like to fuck.</v>

237
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to Nicki Minaj</v>

238
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.103
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

239
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.560
<v Speaker 3>and it would work for him.</v>

240
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.701
<v Speaker 3>It would work for them.</v>

241
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 3>You would see a use a tweet storm of a billion people who say,</v>

242
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get her</v>

243
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's insanity.</v>

244
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>That's where we are.</v>

245
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever do a program thing?</v>

246
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to an alcoholics anonymous meeting or just stop now?</v>

247
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I had a son so I had,</v>

248
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of times I was like,</v>

249
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

250
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

251
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I need to quit and quit and that never works.</v>

252
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>And then there was one night where,</v>

253
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.723
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

254
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 2>it's the first real time on the road.</v>

255
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible with women in high school and college and then suddenly I hit the</v>

256
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>road as a comic and they're everywhere and they're interested and life is</v>

257
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.074
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

258
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a show.</v>

259
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a show first already and usually the sororities that sponsor comedy</v>

260
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 2>shows or like the philanthropy sorority and they're all terrible.</v>

261
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

262
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

263
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 2>these girls were all hot.</v>

264
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Just just dimes.</v>

265
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>The whole chapter just full.</v>

266
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 2>They had like one ugly friend is as the charity,</v>

267
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but they had just gorgeous girls and my opener goes up and bombs and then I go</v>

268
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 2>up to a standing room only crowd and crush and so now it's afterward we're</v>

269
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>

270
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>There's like this after party thing that they put together for just them and the</v>

271
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.271
<v Speaker 2>two of us,</v>

272
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>one of which they hated because he bombed and the like,</v>

273
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>there are just these eight hot girls surrounding me.</v>

274
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.421
<v Speaker 2>One shoulder,</v>

275
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>another one out of the way to sit next to me.</v>

276
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

277
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.050
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

278
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 2>this is like nothing I've ever experienced.</v>

279
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And then they took us to another party and I'm pretty sure someone put something</v>

280
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:07.041
<v Speaker 2>in my drink.</v>

281
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Not In the way of like I want to fuck this guy in the way of like,</v>

282
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy getting all the attention away from the other guys.</v>

283
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the other guys fucked with my drink.</v>

284
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.771
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>

285
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

286
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Because I got super violently ill very quickly,</v>

287
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:19.791
<v Speaker 2>like very,</v>

288
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>very quickly and I spent the whole night I was supposed to stay at the sorority</v>

289
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

290
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

291
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the plan was I was going to stay in the guest room so I didn't even have to do</v>

292
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 2>the whole excuse of like,</v>

293
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.091
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

294
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>can I use your bathroom?</v>

295
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Can I come in for like,</v>

296
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

297
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to go back there with them and I spent the entire night just,</v>

298
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>just vomiting.</v>

299
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

300
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

301
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Somebody spiked your drink and then I lost a Gig the next day and at the time</v>

302
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 2>it's my first year on the road.</v>

303
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I lost a $1,500 gig the next day because you were so sick.</v>

304
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.661
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>

305
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:48.494
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

306
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.281
<v Speaker 2>we were driving,</v>

307
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 2>it was the middle of winter,</v>

308
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 2>but I was wearing two pairs of pants,</v>

309
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 2>two sweatshirts and in a sleeping bag in the car with the heat on full blast and</v>

310
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I was shivering the whole way.</v>

311
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I was fucked up</v>

312
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>so that you didn't have the flu or something.</v>

313
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:01.660
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like the flu.</v>

314
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 2>It went away like six hours later.</v>

315
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>So it could've been,</v>

316
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it could've been a very temporary.</v>

317
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Flew a well timed flu.</v>

318
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:09.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

319
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but that was the night where I was just like,</v>

320
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep doing this.</v>

321
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of a drug that does that?</v>

322
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Like a drug.</v>
