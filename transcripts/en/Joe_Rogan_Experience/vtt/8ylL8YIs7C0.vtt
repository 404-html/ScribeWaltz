1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Four three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up buddy?</v>

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>There's discrepancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>my coffee is way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way bigger than yours.</v>

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I've got like this 40 ounce big gulp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French press.</v>

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus the,</v>

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>is that a caveman cold brew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nitros yeah,</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>those are pretty good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called punch.</v>

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for the bread and the</v>

11
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Ma rooms and goodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I would probably be morbidly obese if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't an exercise freak.</v>

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so makes that sour dough bread and</v>

15
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>it is freaking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do that carnivore diet thing?</v>

16
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you try that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

17
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like me,</v>

19
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't do the cardboard that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to do it for a certain amount</v>

20
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>of time and test it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought about it too much of a foodie.</v>

21
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did was I tried to eat Ribeye</v>

22
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:05.211
<v Speaker 1>steaks every night for dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did like a 33% carnivore diet,</v>

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but there was a study actually that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

24
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>It was just like two days ago on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tmao the the sugar that is associated</v>

25
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>with gut damage when you're eating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>high red meat diet,</v>

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your body takes excess protein and</v>

27
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>it turns it into sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

28
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>With theoretically the idea of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that might be present because your</v>

29
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>microbiome is imbalanced from a diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too heavy and meat.</v>

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there a microfiber?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're buying them.</v>

31
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucogenesis because your body has</v>

32
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>nothing but meet your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns it into glucose.</v>

33
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

34
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>that would be something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that conversion of glucose is a</v>

35
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:52.071
<v Speaker 1>different sugar than the Tmao Tmao is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that's going to be present if you</v>

36
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>aren't getting enough fiber or if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying on his own balanced.</v>

37
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>But what this study a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at was people who were eating</v>

38
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:05.691
<v Speaker 1>like a fish and egg and plant rich diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had high levels of Tmao too,</v>

39
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't deleterious there</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually as of tech because it had the</v>

40
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:11.964
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

41
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean you could do,</v>

42
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you could do a carnivore diet if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were there.</v>

43
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a few populations that do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Spain,</v>

44
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of the sausage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll like eat the,</v>

45
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll eat the ruminant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like delete the intestine of the</v>

46
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>ruminant and get their grasses and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fibers and their plants literally by</v>

47
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>eating the stomach of the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like a cat.</v>

48
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same issue with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathias seen too much of the amino acid</v>

51
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>methionine from just eating red meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be deleterious.</v>

52
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But if you're getting glycine and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these other amino acids,</v>

53
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're reading like nose to tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone marrow,</v>

54
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>bone broth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the organ meats,</v>

55
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>head cheese,</v>

56
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>braunschweiger just like all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different mixes of meats,</v>

57
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be the way to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car more diet.</v>

58
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of people that are</v>

59
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.930
<v Speaker 1>proponents of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a bunch of people that</v>

60
00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

61
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because you've got to,</v>

62
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a disparity between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdotal accounts of health and</v>

63
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing and then blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blood work these folks get is not</v>

64
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean the people on the cardboard?</v>

65
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I've seen,</v>

66
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anything where I see all</v>
<v Speaker 2>their inflammatory markers down their</v>

67
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 2>testosterone up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anything where it's</v>

68
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>looking really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High Blood Glucose is another thing that</v>

69
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you see what I should say that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been a lot of tests done.</v>

70
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are publishing stuff on</v>

71
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the anecdotal evidence is amazing.</v>

72
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>

73
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>my friend Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had a tremendous success with it,</v>

75
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>lost a lot of body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he's in his intellectual prime.</v>

76
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>He said he's never felt better in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his energy levels and that guy is,</v>

77
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Speaker 2>he is so rigid and disciplined with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

78
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>He's eating his meat with salt on it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drinks water and that is slowly,</v>

79
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

80
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it's an elimination diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like an autoimmune diet or you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

82
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's giving me trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soy or wheat or dairy or what have you.</v>

84
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going to stop eating all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff and switched to primarily</v>

85
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 2>meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that it's know I don't</v>

86
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 2>want to call anybody out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

87
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and call them lazy,</v>

88
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.861
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like kind of a very easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy esque approach because rather than</v>

89
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sourdough bread,</v>

90
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 2>it's slow fermented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Rye and the wheat are in there,</v>

91
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 2>but all the phytic acid that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally inhibit your ability to absorb</v>

92
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>minerals is pre digested by the lacto</v>
<v Speaker 2>bash list and all the bacteria in the</v>

93
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 2>wheat.</v>

94
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a bread that's lower on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glycemic index and it's,</v>

95
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:46.201
<v Speaker 2>it's more easily digested with some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the dry and salad or more</v>

96
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.021
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

97
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 2>And you put the Ryan it because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowers the glycemic index and then</v>

98
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

99
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

100
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I forget the term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

103
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a gluten digesting enzyme that</v>

104
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 2>gets activated with the lacto bachelor</v>
<v Speaker 2>lists.</v>

105
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's a smart bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes fricken 24 hours to,</v>

106
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not 24 hours,</v>

107
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's like 15 minutes over 24 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it takes to make it.</v>

108
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 2>That's an intelligent approach to food</v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation,</v>

109
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way that our ancestors or</v>

110
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 2>many of the blue zones would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated their foods fermenting,</v>

111
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 2>soaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprouting,</v>

112
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 2>slow food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can take a lot of these things</v>

113
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 2>that would result in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know his daughter does this as well,</v>

115
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>and mckayla Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use that elimination diet,</v>

116
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>which is the carnivore diet to clear up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those autoimmune issues.</v>

117
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>But you could also just render food more</v>
<v Speaker 2>digestible or switch to an elimination</v>

118
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 2>diet or an autoimmune diet for eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks or 12 weeks,</v>

119
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>something like the Carnivore Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heal the gut,</v>

120
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and then return back to a more all</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusive eating pattern that allows you</v>

121
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:52.324
<v Speaker 2>to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat plants,</v>

123
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things that would normally</v>

124
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>damage the gut</v>

125
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>if the gut is actually</v>

126
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Wiki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the,</v>

127
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.440
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the process like?</v>

128
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:08.100
<v Speaker 2>What is happening when they go on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very strict elimination diet and they're</v>

129
00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.130
<v Speaker 2>just eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is happening to their gut that</v>

130
00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:14.940
<v Speaker 2>allows him to have all these pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty significant health benefits.</v>

131
00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:17.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of loss of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase of energy,</v>

132
00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune issues like Jordan had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

133
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.940
<v Speaker 2>some pretty significant gum issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those all went away.</v>

134
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that went away,</v>

135
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

136
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the gum in the joint stuff might</v>

137
00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:33.360
<v Speaker 1>be just as much related to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's getting a shit ton of college and</v>

138
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber eye or not fiber but odd elastin</v>

139
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.650
<v Speaker 1>and muscle fiber precursors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting a lot of protein.</v>

140
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's eating bone broth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bone marrow,</v>

141
00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a lot of glycine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these other metabolites.</v>

142
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So part of it could just be more fuel on</v>
<v Speaker 1>board to repair muscles or to repair the</v>

143
00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the other part of it is that</v>

144
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>when you eliminate inflammatory products</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're consuming,</v>

145
00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you're eating whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>wonder bread and commercial dairy or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or unfermented soy or any of these</v>

147
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 1>things that can actually damage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lining of the gut.</v>

148
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>You're creating an inflammatory scenario</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're,</v>

149
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you're familiar with the gut brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>access and how our gut interacts with</v>

150
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:16.020
<v Speaker 1>our nervous system via the vagus nerve</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you have inflammation in the</v>

151
00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 1>gut that affects neural symptoms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect sleep,</v>

152
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it affects intellectual performance.</v>

153
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you've also got the autoimmune</v>
<v Speaker 1>component.</v>

154
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:27.570
<v Speaker 1>If you're actually truly allergic to or</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerant to some of those proteins</v>

155
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:30.840
<v Speaker 1>that wind up in the bloodstream in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of a leaky gut,</v>

156
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant proteins,</v>

157
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectins are another one that a lot of</v>

158
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:39.240
<v Speaker 1>people complain about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you create almost like a full body</v>

159
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:42.750
<v Speaker 1>damaged scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is you get rid of all that</v>

160
00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:45.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You introduced the carnivore diet and I</v>

161
00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:47.730
<v Speaker 1>don't know that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>components of the carnivore diet that</v>

162
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>are actually healing the gut as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the absence or elimination of the</v>

163
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 1>foods that were harming it.</v>

164
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

165
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bell brothers,</v>

167
00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Chris and mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know those guys?</v>

168
00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

169
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their take on it is basically they've</v>

170
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 2>never felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

171
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.320
<v Speaker 2>these are guys that work out very</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavily.</v>

172
00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:07.450
<v Speaker 2>The difference between them and Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably that especially if you know</v>

173
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.550
<v Speaker 2>mark is a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's power lifting and you know it has</v>

174
00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 2>been doing that basically his whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

175
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 2>These guys are what their take on it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially there.</v>

176
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>At least the way they think is that most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are talking about diet,</v>

177
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.200
<v Speaker 2>they really don't know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about.</v>

178
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Even though you might be able to look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it on paper and you might have these</v>

179
00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:31.320
<v Speaker 2>ideas about what's beneficial or non</v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>

180
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Some people are proponents of Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>diets,</v>

181
00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:35.850
<v Speaker 2>some people were proponents of you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo.</v>

182
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.100
<v Speaker 2>He's like until you are actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically doing something until you are</v>

183
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:44.100
<v Speaker 2>actually doing something with that diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you report how much better you</v>

184
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 2>feel that the people that are actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>training really hard,</v>

185
00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 2>those are the ones you should rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying for him personally,</v>

186
00:08:49.651 --> 00:08:51.780
<v Speaker 2>he's never felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been leaner.</v>

187
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a big part of it,</v>

188
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean this just returns to</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalization and customization as a</v>

189
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we live in an era where you can</v>

190
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>self quantify pretty easily with</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and you can find out what</v>

191
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>ancestry you came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what blood markers that you have,</v>

192
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.210
<v Speaker 1>what your gut microbiome looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think we talked about this</v>

193
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>on the last show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this idea of eating</v>

194
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 1>according to your ancestry and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of what are called cold spots.</v>

195
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Like areas around the world where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a genetic susceptibility to have</v>

196
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>certain diseases that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually develop.</v>

197
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Those diseases don't actually manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their traditional diet.</v>

198
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at like the Icelandic</v>
<v Speaker 1>population that carries the genes that</v>

199
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>would render them more susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like depression or seasonal</v>

200
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>effective disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But their diet is very rich in omega</v>

201
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>three fatty acids and Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we know can protect against those</v>

202
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>disorders.</v>

203
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And then you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the Icelandic population and you</v>

204
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>uproot them and put them in the context</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a westernized diet and all of a</v>

205
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>sudden depression and sad manifests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

206
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So the same thing for like a Cameroon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameroon,</v>

207
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than normal risk for colon</v>

208
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're eating a diet that's high in</v>

209
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it higher than normal risk?</v>

210
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

211
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a genetic susceptibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that that population</v>

212
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 1>probably figured out at some point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>human history that if they eat a lot of</v>

213
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 1>plants or they eat a lot of fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden people don't have as</v>

214
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>many issues with their colon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

215
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and then you take that same population</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

216
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 1>strip out the fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on a westernized diet,</v>

217
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and you get a large portion of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American population developing</v>

218
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.693
<v Speaker 1>colon cancer.</v>

219
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy about the seasonal</v>
<v Speaker 1>affective disorder and you've got to</v>

220
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>wonder how would that affect people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in Seattle,</v>

221
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest that are dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with constant rain.</v>

222
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that would have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an impact on them.</v>

223
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Probably even more if you come from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

224
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the spokane side,</v>

225
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm out in the middle of the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get Sun for maybe 10 to two and I'm on</v>

226
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>a north facing slope and I work in doors</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the time.</v>

227
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm typing on my computer,</v>

228
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

229
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>blogging and so I don't get a lot of sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure,</v>

230
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>all these new fangled light panels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>head worn light devices and things come</v>

232
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:07.510
<v Speaker 1>in that were actually developed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>seasonal affective disorder,</v>

233
00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>that actually worked pretty well just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your mood up if you're working in</v>

234
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>doors and you'll get sunlight exposure.</v>

235
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But spokane has a different environment,</v>

236
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not dealing with the constant</v>

237
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 1>rain that they're dealing with on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual coast.</v>

238
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Now the precipitation builds up on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mountains and then dumps back on</v>

239
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's still must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must get much more than you get in</v>

241
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>California or southern California at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

242
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to be very beautiful out</v>

244
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

245
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.830
<v Speaker 1>it's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm about 25 minutes from coeur</v>

246
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 1>d'alene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

247
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

248
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

249
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I've never bought lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

250
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I used to go over there and race the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironman and they,</v>

251
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>they'd have that in Lake quarter lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an iconic race just because,</v>

252
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lake,</v>

253
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 1>everything is just gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw pictures of the lake where people</v>

254
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 1>were taking photographs of the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leg,</v>

255
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>like from a hundred a hundred feet deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water.</v>

256
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.040
<v Speaker 1>You could see the bottom of the lake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stack.</v>

257
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny because it's actually</v>

259
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>polluted because of all the mines of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head around there.</v>

260
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of metals in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the quarter Lane Fijian,</v>

261
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the spokane river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're at your allotment of fish</v>

262
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to eat from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spokane rivers,</v>

263
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 1>like one a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

264
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Like it's that high in metals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

265
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want,</v>

266
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't choose to go down there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

267
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

268
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a beautiful lake.</v>

269
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the allotment of fish that</v>

270
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to eat from the leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's similar.</v>

271
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

272
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I went to quarterly and I spent a lot</v>

273
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>of time swimming there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably spend some time in the</v>

274
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>infrared sauna to some of those metals</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

275
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of infrared sauna</v>

276
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>versus traditional sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a benefit?</v>

277
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is it's cooler,</v>

278
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>you know you have an infrared here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

279
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>So you walk into the infrared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 155 258 degrees.</v>

280
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of that'll go up to</v>

281
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>like one 70 even though the air is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler,</v>

282
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>the actual photons of light that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being released by the panels,</v>

283
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by infrared panels</v>

284
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 1>while you're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those penetrate more deeply into tissue.</v>

285
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So you wind up getting a deeper sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sweat for a longer time,</v>

286
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 1>you can stay in there longer because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite as hot.</v>

287
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 1>But you look at like the studies out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finland,</v>

288
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

289
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 1>these studies that show four to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>year lifespan increases from a,</v>

290
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.590
<v Speaker 1>from a weekly sauna protocol of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

291
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like four times a week for</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 to 30 minutes.</v>

292
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

293
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>and the significant drop in dementia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's and a lot of these,</v>

294
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 1>these mortality risk factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the studies that have</v>

295
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 1>been done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an athletes where you get almost a</v>

296
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blood doping effect from sauna</v>

297
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>exposure when done postworkout right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stay in there for 20 to 30 minutes</v>

298
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these were done in a dry sauna.</v>

299
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>That's why I use a dry sauna as per</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Patrick's recommendation.</v>

300
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I just got that cause she said there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real studies like that on an</v>

301
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:55.730
<v Speaker 1>infrared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few metal that,</v>

302
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've analyzed metal and</v>

303
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>detoxification and some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrared saunas and they have found that</v>

304
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>that you release more through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat,</v>

305
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you get a deeper sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your goal is something like</v>

306
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>detoxification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically when I'm in that I'm</v>

307
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking drenched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how could I get more out of that?</v>

308
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried like a like trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 30 minute infrared versus the</v>

309
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.103
<v Speaker 1>dry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

310
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot so uh,</v>

311
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I'm suffering as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't like it.</v>

312
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.010
<v Speaker 1>When you're in the infrared you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like yourself.</v>

313
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.831
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 1>See that's the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm jaded because when I'm my</v>

315
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>infrared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've got a,</v>

316
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I've got a kettle bell in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put my bike in their yoga in there.</v>

317
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 1>When I go in there at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually,</v>

318
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 1>like I was telling you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about those,</v>

319
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>those massage devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

320
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>the sls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are like a pso rit or like</v>

321
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>a shift in your abs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

322
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But they open up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they open up.</v>

323
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>You can work on a lot of body parts</v>

324
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll have stuff like that and there</v>

325
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 2>and occasionally do bodywork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I actually move,</v>

326
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I exercise in the Sauna Sauna that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>designed for that.</v>

327
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.760
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that called again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a specific sauna that a lot of a</v>

328
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 2>UFC guys are using or in Vegas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're building them in gyms.</v>

329
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I know a winkle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johns,</v>

330
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:12.644
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike.</v>

331
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.290
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a TV panel in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

332
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 2>they have televisions in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can even watch things like watch</v>

333
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 2>like a directionals or watch some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a instructional video on exercise.</v>

334
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think they're doing is</v>

335
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to have you do your</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>

336
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at a screen and the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do your workout while you're</v>

337
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>looking at the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the spot.</v>

338
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called fit spa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

339
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.150
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

340
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hot one that I go into mean I sweat</v>

341
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

342
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time believing I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat more anywhere else.</v>

343
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally pouring sweat and I keep</v>

344
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>that fucker around 190 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really feeling ideal scenario.</v>

346
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I would like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dry sauna,</v>

347
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 2>but I would like to get a barrel sauna</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have the infrared in my</v>

348
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those big ones,</v>

349
00:15:56.811 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 2>like the foreperson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrared sauna and that you can get into</v>

350
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

351
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you can yoga more people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

352
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatnot,</v>

353
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.341
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm six two but I can get into like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>full down dog into a laundry or</v>

355
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd love to have a dry sauna as</v>

356
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is embarrassed on a barrel sauna</v>

357
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big barrel.</v>

358
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 2>You've probably seen them before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

359
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

360
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 2>They got benches on either side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're shaped like a,</v>

361
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Speaker 2>like a cylinder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

362
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very popular.</v>

363
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 2>They build up a lot of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even the shape of the barrel</v>

364
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 2>somehow allows the heat to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed more evenly through the</v>

365
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 2>sauna or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

366
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 2>almost almost like a traeger grill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

367
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:34.191
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

368
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:35.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

369
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 2>so that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

370
00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 2>So I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did was I bought one of those,</v>

371
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those endless pools that you swim</v>

372
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:43.641
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

373
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 2>go to that one in the upper right hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner with the bubble on the outside of</v>

374
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks fucking awesome.</v>

375
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep that sucker in your back yard.</v>

376
00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:53.971
<v Speaker 2>I was at a guy's house in Santa Monica</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that thing and it heats up the same</v>

377
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 2>way that some sort of a power source</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to that.</v>

378
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty bad ass.</v>

379
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 2>See I want to get one of those and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it out in the forest where I can</v>

380
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>look out with the zoo or barrel song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Looks fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

382
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

383
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you were in like a cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>area and you could like,</v>

384
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that guys getting set up looking</v>

385
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 2>over a leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could look out into the snow.</v>

386
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Serene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty like a pastoral scene in the</v>

387
00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Cryo after you do the sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get sometimes.</v>

388
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most days,</v>

389
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most days I do either or yesterday I did</v>

390
00:17:26.751 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

391
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

392
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing cryo everyday cause I'm</v>

393
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>staying down at the Hilton and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a a crowd therapy chamber there.</v>

394
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bigger fan of the cold wave at the</v>

395
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Hilton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't cryotherapy.</v>

396
00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a cryotherapy chamber.</v>

397
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 2>They've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a funny,</v>

398
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 2>they have like this thing called upgrade</v>
<v Speaker 2>labs and like the basement of this,</v>

399
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Hilton got like a Cryo,</v>

400
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>they've got an infrared sauna,</v>

401
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>they've got subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been going down there every</v>

402
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 1>day and working out my workout this</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

403
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually I did this machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a machine called a vasper.</v>

404
00:17:58.471 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

405
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You put like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got cold cuffs.</v>

406
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Kaatsu training,</v>

407
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>like blood flow restriction training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>So you put cold cuffs on your arms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you put cold cuffs on your legs and</v>

409
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>it increased the millimeters of mercury</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell you're basically get less blood</v>

410
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>flow to your arms and your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's one of these full body</v>

411
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>exercise devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

412
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Speaker 1>So you're moving your arms and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>

413
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 1>like an elliptical trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're barefoot and the whole thing is</v>

414
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.080
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pumping cold water through the</v>

415
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure cuffs on your arms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs.</v>

416
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.290
<v Speaker 1>And then it's got cold water back behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on the areas right here watching</v>

417
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.580
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

418
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

419
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is not going to make you an</v>

420
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not the purpose of a,</v>

421
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 1>of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the purpose of it?</v>

422
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Just general fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

423
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting cold and when you take</v>

424
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>off the blood pressure cuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you've got a bunch of</v>

425
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>lactic acid trapped in the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you're,</v>

426
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 1>as you're moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically you're doing like 30 seconds</v>

427
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 1>as hard as you can go see Miko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean pretty heavy wattage,</v>

428
00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:00.921
<v Speaker 1>like 600 800 watts for 15 to 30 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you recover and when you finish</v>

429
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 1>and you take those cuffs off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this amplification in growth</v>

430
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

431
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>And based on some of the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about now,</v>

432
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.430
<v Speaker 1>stem cell mobilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

433
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this super quick 21 minute workout.</v>

434
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I actually want to get one from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

435
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And how long has the amplification of</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and growth hormone and all</v>

436
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 1>that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

437
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like a lot of things that</v>

438
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 1>affect testosterone or growth hormone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

439
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a 24 to 48 hour cycle.</v>

440
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:33.084
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like weed,</v>

441
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that we'd suppresses</v>

442
00:19:35.101 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not chronic.</v>

443
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a temporary 24 hour drop in</v>

444
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:42.040
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it really suppressed his task does</v>

445
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.770
<v Speaker 1>know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Although a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the studies on on marijuana,</v>

447
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>they're using pretty high dosage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using rodent models using like a</v>

448
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 1>hundred to 200 milligrams and road and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rushing.</v>

449
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sorry,</v>

450
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 1>what would be the equivalent of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred to 200 milligrams in a human on</v>

451
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>a rodent model?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of,</v>

452
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the studies on supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing with Tbi and concussion.</v>

453
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You know you hear about Dha and fish oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

454
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but you need to take a lot of fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Dha,</v>

455
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>like if you extrapolate from the rodent</v>
<v Speaker 1>models,</v>

456
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:21.111
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like 50 to 60 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dha or fish oil to manage like Tbi or</v>

457
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.390
<v Speaker 1>concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

458
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of Dha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you were going to use like a</v>

459
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>multimodal approach to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Tbi or Alzheimer's or dementia,</v>

460
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of that.</v>

461
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</v>

462
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>key ptosis definitely works that these,</v>

463
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 1>these light devices that you wear on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head now they've got a lot of</v>

464
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 1>research coming out on something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo biomodulation for Tbi and these</v>

465
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:55.111
<v Speaker 1>things produce a hertz frequencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 to 40 hertz range.</v>

466
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>You place them on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically there's like a probe that goes</v>

467
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:02.410
<v Speaker 1>into your nose and they've got new</v>
<v Speaker 1>research coming out on this for</v>

468
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 1>restoring blood flow to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing your Alpha brainwave</v>

469
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>production or gamma grip brainwave</v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

470
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Very cool devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

471
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.170
<v Speaker 1>so what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the probe up your nose do it,</v>

472
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:19.171
<v Speaker 1>it delivers a wavelength of light that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to activate.</v>

473
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Part of the Mitochondria is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>cytochrome c oxidase and when you</v>

474
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 1>activate that you get increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial activity,</v>

475
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you get increased blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get increased production of nitric</v>

476
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this kind of returns to what I was</v>

477
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 1>talking about with seasonal affective</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder where you can use a lot of a</v>

478
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 1>lot of these new things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to deliver infrared light or</v>

479
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.710
<v Speaker 1>light to the body to increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial density or to increase</v>

480
00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 1>blood flow or increased nitric oxide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not using this for Tbi and</v>

481
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 1>concussion and then stem cells as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a,</v>

482
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 1>actually last time I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about how when I got</v>

483
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:58.090
<v Speaker 1>that concussion in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a self administered fusion of</v>

484
00:21:58.091 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 1>sugar alcohols.</v>

485
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I used man a tall and then I followed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up with stem cells because at my</v>

486
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>stem cells stored down in Florida and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also in this lab called forever labs in</v>

487
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I followed that up.</v>

488
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I chased it with a stem cell injection</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you inject sugar alcohol</v>

489
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 1>into your bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it renders your blood brain barrier more</v>

490
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 1>permeable and then the stem cells can</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossover through the blood brain</v>

491
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 1>barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now hold on,</v>

492
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this show your how you,</v>

493
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with the sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

494
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 1>how you're administering it</v>
<v Speaker 1>intravenously and intravenous mannitol</v>

495
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:31.900
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this yourself.</v>

496
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I do this myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could get this done by a doctor</v>

497
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 1>and when you're doing it elaborate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend you get it done.</v>

498
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:38.490
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like a good idea to do now</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

499
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 1>what kind of dosages are using of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mannitol?</v>

500
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was.</v>

501
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It was what I was advised to do by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc who,</v>

502
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 1>who taught me this protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember how much it was.</v>

503
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>But it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a vile.</v>

504
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

505
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I do the same thing with naed every week</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a weekly Nad injection.</v>

506
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Everyone had said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

507
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 1>push any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it takes you 10 minutes with Shy v</v>

508
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.120
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes is pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

509
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.123
<v Speaker 1>it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

510
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>so normally if you were to get 500 to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams of Nad,</v>

511
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.320
<v Speaker 1>most people will sit under a four to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hour drip ivy to do that.</v>

512
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And one reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

513
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 1>that they say is that you get less of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>degraded by the liver and the kidneys</v>

514
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and the gut as [inaudible] goes into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body then it put.</v>

515
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

516
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that the bigger factor is simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that when you do a push,</v>

517
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>like you're nauseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like your whole body's on fire.</v>

518
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you feel like superman</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

519
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very uncomfortable ivy and I don't want</v>

520
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 1>anybody pushing that and accept me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to be in charge of the</v>

521
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:41.830
<v Speaker 1>trigger when I'm putting that thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got to stop and go and stop</v>

522
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

523
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quicker.</v>

524
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.510
<v Speaker 1>It's more convenient than sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing an ISV.</v>

525
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So a push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would actually have a nurse actually</v>

526
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 1>pushing down on the button as things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

527
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

528
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't intermittent intervals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

529
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I do about two like two ticks on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>syringe at a time cause it's a 30 ml</v>

530
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>syringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go like two CC's then stop.</v>

531
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And you could feel like your heart rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and you get nauseous and your skin</v>

532
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>kind of flushes a little bit and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe it off.</v>

533
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you wait like 10 15 seconds and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do another push.</v>

534
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Kyle Kingsbury was saying it felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>his guts were on fire.</v>

535
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught kyle I think is a champ.</v>

536
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it in like five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

537
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

538
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:30.431
<v Speaker 1>if I can do it in 10 minutes then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely mind blowing in terms of</v>

539
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.910
<v Speaker 1>how hard that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he did it in five</v>

540
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:35.530
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

541
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>well he's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's interesting.</v>

542
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I started to listen to your podcast with</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Sinclair on the,</v>

543
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 1>on the car ride over and he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this nmn stuff,</v>

544
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.530
<v Speaker 1>which supposedly when orally</v>
<v Speaker 1>administered simulates a lot of what an</v>

545
00:24:48.531 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 1>ar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicotinamide riboside,</v>

546
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 1>which is one thing that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taking for anti aging and in a d,</v>

547
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>which is what we were just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

548
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>administered via either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in most cases it's ivy,</v>

549
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple companies doing like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>oral and a d version,</v>

550
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 1>but supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

551
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.510
<v Speaker 1>an mn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

552
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if sinclair has any human</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies coming out on this right now,</v>

553
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 1>but he or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least released,</v>

554
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but he's done in the studies and show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's like exercise in a bottle.</v>

555
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 1>The Nad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand though,</v>

556
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and this returns to the Tbi concussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece crosses the blood brain barrier</v>

557
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.360
<v Speaker 1>easily or more easily than nmn or nr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were doing it for like a</v>

558
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:29.970
<v Speaker 1>cognitive or neurological effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may want to choose Nad.</v>

559
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounds to me like from the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

560
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 1>if you were doing it for the exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

561
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe you choose nmn or nr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting being anti aging effect.</v>

562
00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:43.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't even know in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases ha all the pathways on which these</v>

563
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 1>things are working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of them are related to these</v>

564
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>sirtuin pathways where it likes or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>inactivating compounds that actually</v>

565
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 1>allow your mitochondria to repair more</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly or give your body more</v>

566
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is they probably all have a</v>

567
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty good effect on anti aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing it,</v>

568
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 1>are you pushing yourself?</v>

569
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You said you're doing it once a week or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it yourself,</v>

570
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.230
<v Speaker 1>but you pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much time do you give yourself</v>

572
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>to actually do the nmd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

573
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 1>if I've got 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

574
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>If I have to compress in a 10 minutes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at hearts like I like to at least allow</v>

575
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

576
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you follow it up in most cases with like</v>

577
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 1>an ivy cocktail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

578
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>like a myers cocktail vitamin cocktail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and supposedly supposedly that it does a</v>

579
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly it enhances your stem cell</v>

580
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>mobilization or the or the activity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells and allows the n d to be</v>

581
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 1>absorbed into the cells more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you basically,</v>

582
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way I do it is I use it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just a butterfly needle and you do</v>

583
00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:44.870
<v Speaker 1>the Nad administration and then you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrew the,</v>

584
00:26:44.871 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the butterfly needle line.</v>

585
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And then you put the vitamin cocktail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and follow up with vitamin cocktail,</v>

586
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 1>which takes like 30 to 60 seconds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're done.</v>

587
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And why do you do it once a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel good?</v>

588
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.261
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why,</v>

589
00:26:57.261 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>why once a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not twice a week?</v>

590
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is you're,</v>

591
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.040
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to maintain your levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's even some evidence and,</v>

592
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:03.751
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of similar to testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that longterm use may suppress your</v>

594
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 1>body's on nad production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to start to do it.</v>

595
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you may want to realize that this is</v>

596
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 1>something you'd need to do regularly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to keep your levels elevated</v>

597
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 1>because you may get like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>downregulation of fact.</v>

598
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

599
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So your body might recognize that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't up a surplus.</v>

600
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of Nad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to make more.</v>

601
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.393
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the very interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I did a couple of weeks ago was I</v>

603
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>went to New York City and I got Nad from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doctor,</v>

604
00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>a Dr. Chen over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he infused me with a co q 10</v>

605
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of other vitamins to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body to make more of what are called</v>

606
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 1>adult pluripotent stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also known as the t cells,</v>

607
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 1>very small embryonic like cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you've heard of a pair of biosis</v>

608
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:58.461
<v Speaker 1>before this idea of taking the blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>from young mice and transferring that</v>

609
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 1>into old mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was research that they did at</v>

610
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Stanford University on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You impart essentially enhance longevity</v>

611
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 1>to the old mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that's a,</v>

612
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a non autologous transfer or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

613
00:28:10.571 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So that's the transfer of blood from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my young healthy donor into an</v>

614
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>older recipient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are companies now in silicon</v>

615
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:19.440
<v Speaker 1>valley doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the young blood institute,</v>

616
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like $8,000 this company called</v>

617
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Ambrosia.</v>

618
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you the plasma from a young</v>

619
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:27.030
<v Speaker 1>healthy donor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any evidence that that does</v>

620
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:29.590
<v Speaker 1>anything good for you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the studies that they've done</v>

621
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 1>in mice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

622
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know of any studies on humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

623
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was their anecdotal evidence.</v>

624
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people that,</v>

625
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

626
00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to,</v>

627
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 1>to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you haven't,</v>

628
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an autologous version of that,</v>

629
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't want to put somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood so he didn't run body.</v>

630
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 1>So what I did was I had this doc take</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a pint in my blood.</v>

631
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is if you've put all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these vitamins like Nad and stuff into</v>

632
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:55.860
<v Speaker 1>your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increases your stem cell production.</v>

633
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 1>If you stress the blood after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it dumps out a bunch of these tiny</v>

634
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 1>little adult pluripotent stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the same type of cell</v>

635
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that you're getting when you do one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young blood transfers.</v>

636
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So he stresses that overnight in cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use cold,</v>

637
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you could use pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could use anything to,</v>

638
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 1>to increase the stem cell release from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood cells,</v>

639
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but they get stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They released stem cells and then what</v>

640
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 1>happens is you get them injected back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your body.</v>

641
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>So this is similar to like what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with Regena cane.</v>

642
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know Janky and they take the</v>

643
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 1>blood out and they stress it with hia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they spin it in a centered</v>

644
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.480
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

645
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know a lot about what regena</v>

646
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:39.260
<v Speaker 1>keen is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're more concentrating</v>

647
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 1>the growth factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be doing exosomes.</v>

648
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I know they've got some overseas places</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're doing like a culture</v>

649
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>expanded or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as in the u s like this,</v>

650
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 1>this protocol is one of the few that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know of where you could take your own</v>

651
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 1>blood and get a lot of that same stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd get from culture expanded or</v>

652
00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 1>from para biosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like using the blood of somebody else</v>

653
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 1>and you get all these stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>released into your body.</v>

654
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.520
<v Speaker 1>So you essentially get the same effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you would if you took young person</v>

655
00:30:08.521 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 1>who if he did a young blood transfer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young blood transfer,</v>

656
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:15.140
<v Speaker 1>then not transferring the entire bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply of blow their third month,</v>

657
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 1>they're taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a bunch of plasma,</v>

658
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the volume that they're using.</v>

659
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>In my case they took a pint of my blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So four,</v>

660
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>four 60 cc tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is there any anecdotal evidence or</v>

661
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:29.770
<v Speaker 1>any published evidence on your style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what you're trying to do and the</v>

662
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 1>benefits of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

663
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Ms. Dot equals one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like 1 million bucks</v>

664
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

665
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:36.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one that I did that worked for</v>

666
00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 1>a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knee,</v>

667
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 1>because I have some meniscus issues on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my left knee was I did what's called a</v>

668
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 1>nerve hydrodissection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this before?</v>

669
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydro dissection is a protocol where</v>

670
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:51.610
<v Speaker 1>they take a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a liquid and they used the liquid</v>

671
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:56.611
<v Speaker 1>to act like the scalp or the knife that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surgeon would use to kind of remove</v>

672
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>adhesions like scar tissue adhesions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate a nerve that's causing pain or</v>

673
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:05.590
<v Speaker 1>discomfort or lack of mobility in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain joint.</v>

674
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>But when they do a nerve hydrodissection</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to use like,</v>

675
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like they'd use in</v>

676
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:15.520
<v Speaker 1>prolotherapy like sugar water or regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

677
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I had done,</v>

678
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 1>and this was at a clinic called bio</v>
<v Speaker 1>reset in uh,</v>

679
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 1>in San Jose with Doctor Matt Cook down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

680
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>He went in and did a nerve</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrodissection and he used ozone and a,</v>

681
00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a placental cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like a culture expanded</v>

682
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 1>placental cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I understand to be illegal</v>

683
00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 1>in the u s but just like a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>placental extract.</v>

684
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.250
<v Speaker 1>He did that into my knee and my knee</v>
<v Speaker 1>went from like 25% to 100% in a couple</v>

685
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.320
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that protocol was called nerve</v>

686
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.700
<v Speaker 1>hydrodissection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use ultrasound imaging to,</v>

687
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.650
<v Speaker 1>to basically visualize where the needle</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going into the knee.</v>

688
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.040
<v Speaker 1>They identify the area where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adhesion or the scar tissue is.</v>

689
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.460
<v Speaker 1>They inject it right there and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like a 10 minute long</v>

690
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.294
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>

691
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Now this is for only a buildup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adhesions and scar tissue.</v>

692
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:06.900
<v Speaker 1>What about for people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Mike,</v>

693
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 1>it was coping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

694
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 1>it was developed for nerve pain and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found was that it actually seems to</v>

695
00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:18.160
<v Speaker 1>cause some kind of a release of the scar</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue followed by an increase in the</v>

696
00:32:18.161 --> 00:32:20.590
<v Speaker 1>blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is difficult to get in some areas</v>

697
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 1>of the knee especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

698
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever get to the point where</v>

699
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:28.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody wants to sculpt my knee or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

700
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely consider doing that</v>

701
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 1>dream of first cause they worked very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and it was just quick and easy.</v>

702
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a meniscus issue and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>exosomes shot into that.</v>

703
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I've had it done three times</v>

704
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:45.070
<v Speaker 2>now and every time I've done it I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced a good benefit from it.</v>

705
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 2>But then I beat the shit out of it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I gave it not enough time to heal</v>

706
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Speaker 2>up before I started pounding again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would give it like a week off,</v>

707
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 2>then start running again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I'm going to give it a full six</v>

708
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>weeks with a no pounding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no running hills,</v>

709
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 2>nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've experienced just in the two</v>

710
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 2>weeks since the procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very significant decrease in pain,</v>

711
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>no inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreasing.</v>

712
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to like try to make it feel weird</v>

713
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 2>now I have to like go out of my way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like every week that's more and</v>

714
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 2>more difficult to do and range of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motions increased.</v>

715
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically it can go all the way down</v>

716
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:24.830
<v Speaker 2>with my ass to my ankles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>

717
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bend all the way down and back all</v>

718
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 2>the way up with no discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no weirdness.</v>

719
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of question the one thing,</v>

720
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 2>cause I've asked myself this before and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have,</v>

721
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.630
<v Speaker 2>like when you get a protocol like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>done any kind of go easy on your knee</v>

722
00:33:38.631 --> 00:33:41.330
<v Speaker 2>because you really want it to work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start backing off as some of that</v>

723
00:33:41.331 --> 00:33:44.180
<v Speaker 2>stuff you were doing anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of it is you just backing off</v>

724
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>of what you were doing and how much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the exosomes and the south cells?</v>

725
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I know because I did try to back off</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially and it didn't have any</v>

726
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:53.310
<v Speaker 2>incident compared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

727
00:33:53.311 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I backed off initially with</v>

728
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said let me just take some time off</v>

729
00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 2>and let it see if I can let it heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't,</v>

730
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 2>it ain't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

731
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 2>it stayed exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just hurt,</v>

732
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

733
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:09.140
<v Speaker 2>so it was one of those things where in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past I would have had to just deal</v>

734
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

735
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Now this is my new world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my new feeling and my knee until</v>

736
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I get it scoped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

737
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The impact that it's had.</v>

738
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant believer in stem cells and</v>

739
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:23.200
<v Speaker 2>exosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a full length rotator cuff tear in</v>

740
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 2>my right shoulder and now it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>

741
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Doctor Rodney Mcgee out a vegas</v>

742
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:30.361
<v Speaker 2>coat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

743
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:31.980
<v Speaker 2>He looked at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

744
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 2>the MRI and he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

745
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>do you know how fucking crazy that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you had a tear and your rotator</v>

746
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 2>cuff and now there is no tear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's regenerated tissue.</v>

747
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the ultimate goal,</v>

748
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

749
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 2>now I have zero pain in this shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

750
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 2>nothing did you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

751
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:51.350
<v Speaker 2>did you not have belong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did peptides.</v>

752
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it bpc one,</v>

753
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

754
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be the pc one five,</v>

755
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only one that's,</v>

756
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>that's still legal according to Usada</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Wada for athletes to use.</v>

757
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.280
<v Speaker 2>And that one decreases inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases blood flow.</v>

758
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.410
<v Speaker 2>And then the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that that's not allowed anymore</v>

759
00:35:10.411 --> 00:35:13.640
<v Speaker 2>as tb 500 times and Beta 500 and not one</v>
<v Speaker 2>repairs.</v>

760
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 2>The Actin and myocin fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in a,</v>

761
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:20.080
<v Speaker 2>in a gold standard protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back and forth between the two.</v>

762
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Speaker 2>When you switch it up one one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inject subcutaneously near the site</v>

763
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:28.640
<v Speaker 2>of injury now works for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The peptides are weird.</v>

764
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm attending all these anti aging and</v>

765
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>longevity conferences now cause I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn a lot more about this.</v>

766
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kinda starting to pivot from just</v>

767
00:35:36.681 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>pure human performance to how</v>

768
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you live a long time and talk to</v>

769
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>sinclair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

770
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I want to finish listening to your</v>

771
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 1>interview with him cause I was intrigued</v>
<v Speaker 1>by have an older guy.</v>

772
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

773
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that these peptides are</v>

774
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 1>talked about a lot now in these anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging circles.</v>

775
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got weird names like,</v>

776
00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 1>like epic Taylon is one and two times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

777
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 1>like a 10 to 20 day injection protocol</v>
<v Speaker 1>of epic Taylon.</v>

778
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They're getting a bunch of increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial density,</v>

779
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 1>decrease markers of aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

780
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 1>increased fat loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased muscle gain.</v>

781
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And they've done that in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

782
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it's just a peptide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy.</v>

783
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would inject it next to your</v>

784
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 1>abdominals subcutaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another one.</v>

785
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 1>No side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

786
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with that one,</v>

787
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but this one called Melanotan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of it before?</v>

788
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was intrigued by this.</v>

789
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Somebody was telling me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

790
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a peptide and it was used in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding industry for a long time</v>

791
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 1>because when you inject it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you,</v>

792
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this amazing Tan and they call it</v>

793
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Malano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanis stimulates your Melanin lady that</v>

794
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:48.810
<v Speaker 1>was on that fucking show that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning black.</v>

795
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 1>She believed that she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

796
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Then the wrong skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was shooting something into her</v>

797
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 1>body and she got black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Congo black.</v>

798
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

799
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I tried it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried it out for about a week.</v>

800
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>You try to get black?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

801
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't try to get black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want it.</v>

802
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Just wanted to see what happened to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tan.</v>

803
00:37:04.541 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And I started to get some freckles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the side effect of this is you get</v>

804
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 1>massive boners that lasts a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoyingly long time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can't say no,</v>

806
00:37:15.721 --> 00:37:17.890

<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

807
00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 1>like an ed type of drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

808
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even know the mechanism of</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

809
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know how it's even working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

822
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing something that seems like,</v>

823
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very popular with the young people</v>

824
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:55.794
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

825
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.220
<v Speaker 1>They're taking fat out of certain parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their body and putting it in their</v>

826
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

827
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

828
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should find out.</v>

829
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 1>That's how I see getting diaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just google are women today.</v>

830
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.420
<v Speaker 1>How are instagram models getting diaper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm curious because that's what it</v>

831
00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you're using their own.</v>

832
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.080

<v Speaker 1>We should do that for our calves.</v>

835
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 1>That way we could start an instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>calf channel.</v>

836
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

837
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.860

<v Speaker 1>my stove top sear followed by the quick</v>

<v Speaker 1>and a half to two hours smoke in the</v>

858
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 1>trigger with that coffee rub on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just finishing it on the grill</v>

859
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:26.374
<v Speaker 1>with the tracker.</v>

860
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a uh,</v>

861
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

862
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

863
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 1>A prime rib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so instead it's basically ribeye roast</v>

865
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and I did one on the trigger and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked it for like four hours at 220</v>

866
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

867
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 1>You smoked it for hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

868
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it had,</v>

869
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I use the traders</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke at that temperature.</v>

870
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 1>This is a super smoke setting at two 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>and below.</v>

871
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Press the super smoke button and it</v>

872
00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:59.690
<v Speaker 1>constantly infuses this pump of smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

873
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

874
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried super smoke at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>high of a temperature.</v>

875
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Good loans or US delicious dude and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the trager prime rib rub.</v>

876
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I know it has sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tastes too delicious to not,</v>

877
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but holy shit when it's in there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half,</v>

878
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 1>four hours and it has that crossed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

879
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.720
<v Speaker 1>There's some words some about that long</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

880
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to beer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can chicken beer can chicken?</v>

881
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried a bunch of different rubs on</v>

882
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that but just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just core salt and black pepper works</v>

883
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:31.620
<v Speaker 1>fine for the beer can chicken you empty</v>
<v Speaker 1>about half of the beer can out.</v>

884
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 1>You open up the beer can but then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke a couple extra holes in the top so</v>

885
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you get more of the steam so they inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the chicken gets even more moist.</v>

886
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 1>But then when I figured out is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>use like a little little scalpel or</v>

887
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>exacto knife and you cut open the skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the chicken around the outside a</v>

888
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 1>little bit and you stuff that with pads</v>
<v Speaker 1>of butter and then you do your smoke</v>

889
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 1>pads of butter and said the chicken that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin gets crispy,</v>

890
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>super crispy and so you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

891
00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half.</v>

892
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>He Cook that one and he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't smoke that one very</v>

893
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:04.370
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to run the grill with a</v>

894
00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:07.510
<v Speaker 1>smoke on but you can't super smoke it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't seem to work so well,</v>

895
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 1>but that beer can chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's frickin amazing.</v>

896
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoever figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever drunk figured that out as a god</v>

897
00:41:13.411 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 1>damn genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

898
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>But I've wondered before if there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that will work even better</v>

899
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 1>than beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got Jamie,</v>

900
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.760
<v Speaker 1>it says in most cases what I'm finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>is either Brazilian butt lift or just</v>

901
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:31.450
<v Speaker 1>like a fat graft or fat injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there have been cases where I'm</v>

902
00:41:31.451 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>seeing that they had to get an injection</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out within weeks because it was</v>

903
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 1>causing a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't know if that was just</v>

904
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you got the fat put in then you have</v>

905
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 1>to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it back out.</v>

906
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:40.364
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they were to,</v>

907
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.530
<v Speaker 1>they were dying the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

908
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you have this fucking war zone</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an hour.</v>

909
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is light leaves,</v>

910
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>some bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syrian few pocs.</v>

911
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Airstrip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more.</v>

913
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>No more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>G string,</v>

914
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 1>32 people died supposedly in 2017 from</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

915
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

916
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the same amount of people</v>

917
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 2>that died from coconuts fall on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

918
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking ridiculous way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

919
00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:08.930
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

920
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is not aesthetically</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasing because it violates your</v>

921
00:42:13.371 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities cause you look at the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you look at the legs and you go,</v>

922
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get that ass with those</v>

923
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:21.140
<v Speaker 2>legs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't go together.</v>

924
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at like a crossfitters</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>

925
00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:28.940
<v Speaker 2>like one of them powerful gals with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big butt,</v>

926
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 2>but they also have to shoot with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

927
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 2>The high neon compression socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

928
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 2>la La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks right.</v>

929
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.050
<v Speaker 2>It fits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the assets,</v>

930
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 2>it's the thigh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not entirely disproportionate.</v>

931
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the ass pumps out and then it goes</v>

932
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 2>to a little toothpick legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

933
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

934
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's comical.</v>

935
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a real ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Graham.</v>

936
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 1>We may be evolving as a species to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>these type of things more attractive</v>

937
00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:58.730
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the whole idea was social</v>

938
00:42:58.731 --> 00:43:02.540
<v Speaker 1>media is you get a dopamine hit every</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you click on the little blue</v>

939
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 1>notification button or you look at a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo.</v>

940
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we're just going to eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a real appreciation for that</v>

941
00:43:09.711 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 1>type of symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

942
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.470
<v Speaker 1>we'll redefine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

943
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Know what true human symmetry is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>

944
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't look as good.</v>

945
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cheap fix your squats.</v>

946
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your ass to the gym.</v>

947
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Girls to sit down wefts run up hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

948
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So squats and muscle building.</v>

949
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see that Rhonda?</v>

950
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:35.231
<v Speaker 1>Patrick tweeted that study about mice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mile Nuclei and how when they,</v>

951
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.680
<v Speaker 1>when they dope mice they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never actually lose the muscles.</v>

952
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Mile Nuclei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

953
00:43:44.611 --> 00:43:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like those don't actually ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear even just when you dope but</v>

954
00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>just when you lift period muscle milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially we had already known bill</v>

955
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 1>down muscle memory.</v>

956
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Muscle memory is always been in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anecdotal idea.</v>

957
00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>We'll muscle memory has been in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases just based on a motor unit</v>

958
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:04.700
<v Speaker 1>recruitment like meaning like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my wife,</v>

959
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>she ran for University of Idaho and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out running with her still,</v>

960
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 1>even though she doesn't train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just got faster leg turnover,</v>

961
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>she's got better form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like her body just remembers that.</v>

962
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with a swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

963
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a triathlon.</v>

964
00:44:17.061 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who swam in college but hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>swam in 10 years will kick my ass just</v>

965
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Speaker 1>because they have that muscle memory in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of which,</v>

966
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 1>which motor units to recruit when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this latest one was basically the</v>

967
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 1>idea that you retain actual Myo Nuclei</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the muscle.</v>

968
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Like they thought for a long time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those just disappeared and went away</v>

969
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 1>once you detrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that they're all still</v>

970
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:39.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

971
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you start training again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build muscle more quickly.</v>

972
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

973
00:44:44.361 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 1>and this was kind of like the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is if you've done some kind</v>

974
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:49.081
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 1>illegal performance enhancing procedure</v>
<v Speaker 1>or steroids or adult or whatever,</v>

976
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you actually would have a higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration of micro nuclei or mio</v>

977
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:58.560
<v Speaker 1>nuclei available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>

978
00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>there was a study even leading up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

979
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 1>and this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was like 2013 like this was</v>

980
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:08.511
<v Speaker 1>a while ago where they took mice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave one group testosterone.</v>

981
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.020
<v Speaker 1>The other group didn't get it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spent six months off testosterone.</v>

982
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how long they were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

983
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but they spent six months off it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they took those mice and they</v>

984
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 1>trained them with the training protocol</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mice that were on the</v>

985
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:23.880
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're no longer on,</v>

986
00:45:23.881 --> 00:45:28.881
<v Speaker 1>it had a 30% increase in muscle mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the other mice that only had</v>

987
00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>a 5% increase on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once again,</v>

988
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was probably related to that,</v>

989
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:35.970
<v Speaker 1>my nuclei thing that just came out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this recent study,</v>

990
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 1>so it turns out that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

991
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you should lift like when you're young</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can build all these micro</v>

992
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 1>nuclei that just basically hang around</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and then b,</v>

993
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.860
<v Speaker 1>when they like ban somebody from sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doping and then they come back and</v>

994
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 1>start to compete in that sport again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have an advantage.</v>

995
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that that has huge implications for</v>

996
00:45:58.061 --> 00:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>MMA is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big debate right now.</v>

997
00:46:00.821 --> 00:46:04.780
<v Speaker 2>How long should someone get suspended</v>
<v Speaker 2>for and for how long,</v>

998
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long afterwards should they be</v>

999
00:46:07.361 --> 00:46:09.020
<v Speaker 2>considered enhanced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're giving people some pretty</v>

1001
00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:14.290
<v Speaker 2>significant suspensions now for</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

1002
00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.300
<v Speaker 2>like two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1003
00:46:16.301 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 2>there's this Jon Jones case and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of,</v>

1004
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.950
<v Speaker 2>do you wear this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Where he's testing positive for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite,</v>

1006
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:27.460
<v Speaker 2>for the longterm metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very small dose.</v>

1007
00:46:27.461 --> 00:46:30.400
<v Speaker 2>He's never tested positive for short</v>
<v Speaker 2>term metabolite.</v>

1008
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Which testosterone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1009
00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:34.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1010
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.400
<v Speaker 2>what is the stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrana ball.</v>

1011
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And essentially it's a tainted</v>

1012
00:46:39.851 --> 00:46:42.130
<v Speaker 2>supplement and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have any performance</v>

1013
00:46:42.131 --> 00:46:44.090
<v Speaker 2>enhancing benefit in terms of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1014
00:46:44.091 --> 00:46:47.170
<v Speaker 2>the amount of the dosage that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested positive for,</v>

1015
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's lingering in his system because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protocols for,</v>

1016
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weather ability rather to detect</v>

1017
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:56.170
<v Speaker 2>these metabolites has increased rapidly.</v>

1018
00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And over the last year it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably more sensitive to the point</v>

1019
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:01.331
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1020
00:47:01.331 --> 00:47:05.770
<v Speaker 2>they're detecting these infants</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably small levels of these</v>

1021
00:47:05.771 --> 00:47:07.840
<v Speaker 2>metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also seems to be some sort</v>

1022
00:47:07.841 --> 00:47:11.440
<v Speaker 2>of a pulsing effect when your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>releases these infant testimony,</v>

1023
00:47:11.441 --> 00:47:15.190
<v Speaker 2>small metabolites and then doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll test negative and then the</v>

1024
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.340
<v Speaker 2>next week you'll test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only for the longterm metabolite,</v>

1025
00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:21.670
<v Speaker 2>which is an indication that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>re administration of the performance</v>

1026
00:47:21.671 --> 00:47:22.900
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:25.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in everybody's mad.</v>

1028
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.460
<v Speaker 2>There's so many athletes that are mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1029
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 2>And from what you're saying and for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>study that Doctor Rhonda Patrick</v>

1030
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 2>highlighted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1031
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1032
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it's especially for someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>willingly taken something</v>

1033
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.840
<v Speaker 2>dope are always a doper type of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is that.</v>

1034
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 2>But see the John Jones situation is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky because she's so good and he's so</v>

1035
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 2>dominant that people just assume that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing something his whole</v>

1036
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:51.620
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

1037
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you catch them they're like,</v>

1038
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Aha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why he's so good.</v>

1039
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 2>And it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also might be,</v>

1040
00:47:57.701 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 2>he's got phenomenal genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has two brothers.</v>

1041
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 2>He was just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best of the guys who are taking</v>

1042
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different situation because</v>

1043
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a sport where at least in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time period where he was competing,</v>

1044
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.770
<v Speaker 2>everyone was doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 2>100% they had to go meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the UFC is like that.</v>

1046
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not right that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1047
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're too strict.</v>

1048
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 2>The Usada is knocking on doors at six</v>
<v Speaker 2>o'clock in the morning,</v>

1049
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 2>pee in this cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1050
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you do hear about positive tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of positive Taz versus</v>

1051
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 2>the negative test is overwhelming way</v>
<v Speaker 2>more guys are not doing something.</v>

1052
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be in the nineties everyone</v>

1053
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:35.524
<v Speaker 2>was doing something.</v>

1054
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about this on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight companion podcast that a big issue</v>

1055
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 2>is grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grappling competitions are overrun with</v>

1056
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 2>steroid users because no one's testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>

1057
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the smell test is off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking charts.</v>

1058
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:51.550
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at these guys who just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>

1059
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.190
<v Speaker 2>just jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low body fat,</v>

1060
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>super high muscle mass and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>training Jujitsu all the time too.</v>

1061
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 2>So you would think it would be very hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to maintain muscle mass as well</v>

1062
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:06.820
<v Speaker 2>as be able to train the way they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>training with technique and drills and</v>

1063
00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 2>cardio and it's very difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain muscle.</v>

1064
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any concurrent strength endurance</v>

1065
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:13.450
<v Speaker 2>training scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult,</v>

1066
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a real issue with some of</v>

1067
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:22.711
<v Speaker 2>these guys competing this way and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to transition into MMA now.</v>

1068
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal with marijuana in</v>

1069
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.960
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in mma?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much legal now.</v>

1070
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1071
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 2>they don't in season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of season.</v>

1072
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1073
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.720
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've lowered the um,</v>

1074
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 2>acceptable level or the they've raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rather like what you could have in</v>

1075
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 2>your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You basically just can't be high the day</v>

1076
00:49:42.311 --> 00:49:43.730
<v Speaker 2>of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's another interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that acts,</v>

1078
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.620
<v Speaker 2>especially thc acts on a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>mtor pathways,</v>

1079
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1080
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>that's the same thing with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these anti aging compounds,</v>

1081
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wrap a myosin or met form and to a</v>

1082
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 2>lesser extent acts on that end tor</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway and inhibited.</v>

1083
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1084
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's short term was something like</v>

1085
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and you also get this pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing effect.</v>

1086
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget if this was a study or if it</v>

1087
00:50:09.431 --> 00:50:11.500
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was like anecdotal,</v>

1088
00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like a higher thrill</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeking effect.</v>

1089
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Like the endocannabinoid system when</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulated shuts down some of your,</v>

1090
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sense of fear when it comes to</v>

1091
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 2>experiencing a new adventure.</v>

1092
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you actually,</v>

1093
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you actually go adventure seeking more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at like ultra runners,</v>

1094
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's competing in a,</v>

1095
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:37.690
<v Speaker 2>a non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complex activity in which they might</v>

1096
00:50:37.691 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>have already developed the ability to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to be in the zone,</v>

1097
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've put in their 10,000 hours of</v>

1098
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>practice and they're able to just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of check out and go into automatic mode.</v>

1099
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 2>When you combine that with the pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>quelling effects of something like,</v>

1100
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 2>in most cases like a thc cbd Combo is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of ultra runners are using.</v>

1102
00:50:56.331 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what what they'd use in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in mma right now,</v>

1103
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you get a good effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1104
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 2>but the loss of reaction time and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>loss of the ability to be able to</v>

1105
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>perform complex tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they proven like flight simulation</v>

1106
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 2>studies dictates that it's still not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that great of a drug if you are going to</v>

1107
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:15.320
<v Speaker 2>be doing complex tasks.</v>

1108
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.140
<v Speaker 2>The question though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're talking about reaction</v>

1109
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:20.350
<v Speaker 2>studies done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talking about reactions,</v>

1110
00:51:20.351 --> 00:51:24.770
<v Speaker 2>studies for people that are acclimated</v>
<v Speaker 2>to taking marijuana or they talking</v>

1111
00:51:24.771 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 2>about it with people where they take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's a sober person and they</v>

1112
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 2>introduced him to marijuana and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this overwhelming effect of it because</v>

1113
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't accustomed to thc is the</v>

1114
00:51:36.141 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 2>freak out effect where they're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1115
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.220
<v Speaker 2>they're not comfortable with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1116
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 2>After a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's described,</v>

1117
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all anecdotal,</v>

1118
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 2>but by people that are accustomed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

1119
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 2>you just get good at being high and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reaction time thing.</v>

1120
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy because a lot of strikers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of uh,</v>

1121
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 2>kickboxers they train what while they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on marijuana,</v>

1122
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>it's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of leave it on reaction time was</v>

1123
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 2>done on pilots and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few more blinky lights in a</v>

1124
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:07.720
<v Speaker 2>cockpit than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a mat.</v>

1125
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 2>So sure that my more going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1126
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 2>But that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>

1127
00:52:12.081 --> 00:52:16.100
<v Speaker 2>are they experienced stoners or these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are freaking out and maybe</v>

1128
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 2>the reaction time is they're spacing out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know what the fuck this</v>

1129
00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 2>experience is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there they might have anxiety</v>

1130
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:22.970
<v Speaker 2>because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1131
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really overwhelming sensations that come</v>

1132
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:28.700
<v Speaker 2>with that marijuana high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them,</v>

1133
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call it paranoia or over sensitivity</v>

1134
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you get paralysis by</v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis when you're under the influence</v>

1135
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:39.290
<v Speaker 2>of those things where it's the acute</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus chronic effect.</v>

1136
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 2>But Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

1137
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 2>my personal experience with Jujitsu and</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is,</v>

1138
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 2>it's an enhancer and I've argued this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think it's a performance</v>

1139
00:52:46.911 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 2>enhancing with cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBD.</v>

1140
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:50.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just marijuana.</v>

1141
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a lot of endurance athletes</v>

1142
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.781
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1143
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like folks in the ultra running</v>

1144
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>communities and now like they'll use</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a trace amount of thc combined with</v>

1145
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 2>cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like four to one to attend to one cbd to</v>

1146
00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 2>thc ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you know now with the farm</v>

1147
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:08.360
<v Speaker 2>bill and increasingly gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this idea of developing sports</v>

1148
00:53:08.361 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 2>performance supplements for athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who aren't competing in sports</v>

1149
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.280
<v Speaker 2>that is band are going to be steered in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the direction of like high cbd and then</v>

1150
00:53:16.281 --> 00:53:17.920
<v Speaker 2>some of these other novel molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1151
00:53:17.921 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Like CBG or CBN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of this.</v>

1152
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 2>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1153
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these different terpenes.</v>

1154
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBN</v>

1155
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 1>or cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THC eight is an antiinflammatory that's</v>

1156
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:34.581
<v Speaker 1>totally different than thc nine ladies</v>
<v Speaker 1>from orally ingesting it or from smoking</v>

1157
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 1>it or they actually are an owl isolating</v>
<v Speaker 1>these in labs almost like organic</v>

1158
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1159
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:45.471
<v Speaker 1>you can take hemp or marijuana and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually isolate specific compounds</v>

1160
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and then combine them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could take,</v>

1161
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:53.181
<v Speaker 1>like you could take like CBG CBD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combine that with other turpines from</v>

1162
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say lavender and Valerian and</v>

1163
00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 1>camomile and make like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a de stress relaxation type of</v>

1164
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 1>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could do like a,</v>

1165
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 1>like a thc but a thc eight instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thc nine and combine that with like</v>

1166
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 1>cinnamon and peppermint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some caffeine or creatine or</v>

1167
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>something like that to make like more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pick me up type of compound.</v>

1168
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the wave of the future when it</v>

1169
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 1>comes to a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these marijuana companies that are</v>

1170
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 1>developing stuff for specific goals.</v>

1171
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of folks that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cbd that use it for information,</v>

1172
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>especially athletes like it with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of Thc,</v>

1173
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:32.280
<v Speaker 1>they seem to think it's more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1174
00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a combined effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thc with the CVD.</v>

1175
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 1>They call that the a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entourage effect,</v>

1177
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have all the different terpenes</v>

1178
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:43.660
<v Speaker 1>and the endocannabinoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one's turtle?</v>

1179
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one's turtle have no clue.</v>

1180
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1181
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different cannabinoids,</v>

1182
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's hundreds.</v>

1183
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's at least dozens.</v>

1184
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of them,</v>

1185
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1186
00:54:57.361 --> 00:55:00.330
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a chart of the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>Endo cannabinoids,</v>

1187
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:05.331
<v Speaker 1>they've actually discovered if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just google 113 yeah.</v>

1188
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of fucking cannabinoids.</v>

1189
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there'll be able to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>design something that gives you the high</v>

1191
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:15.700
<v Speaker 1>without the paranoia or gives you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.600
<v Speaker 1>various effects without spacing out.</v>

1193
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1194
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 1>that's where supplementation is going in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

1195
00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like we were talking about</v>

1196
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 1>with Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how based on your genetics,</v>

1197
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.480
<v Speaker 1>based in your blood work based and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bio,</v>

1198
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 1>that's how you would choose your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1199
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the carnivore diet.</v>

1200
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1201
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:38.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say like sub Saharan African or</v>
<v Speaker 1>South East Asia and you have high levels</v>

1202
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 1>there are genes for salivary amylase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one called the am.</v>

1204
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Why one gene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are genes responsible for you</v>

1205
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:50.271
<v Speaker 1>having a higher inflammatory response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat or a ketogenic diet or</v>

1206
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:55.611
<v Speaker 1>like there's one called the apoe gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apoe e three for which I have dictates</v>

1207
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that even though I personally kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a higher fat,</v>

1208
00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:01.740
<v Speaker 1>low carbohydrate diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of my fats come from</v>

1209
00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean fat sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1210
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>a lot of olive oils like avocado oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fish.</v>

1211
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And I do that because my genetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictate that,</v>

1212
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my macronutrient ratio,</v>

1213
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.680
<v Speaker 1>my diet is gonna is gonna be best suited</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that specific ratio of fats.</v>

1214
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>But you could say the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

1215
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with supplements,</v>

1216
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these different places that</v>

1217
00:56:25.061 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 1>will self quantify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1218
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:31.420
<v Speaker 1>like wellness fx and inside track in 23</v>
<v Speaker 1>in me,</v>

1219
00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

1220
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you can take all of this data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together and actually determined,</v>

1221
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever my,</v>

1222
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 1>everybody's saying was supposed to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 international units of vitamin D a</v>

1223
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your vitamin D levels are like 80 or</v>

1224
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.110
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that could cause arterial</v>

1225
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 1>calcification if you're taking excess</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D.</v>

1226
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had both myself and my kids tested for</v>

1227
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:54.820
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our genetics,</v>

1228
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:59.440
<v Speaker 1>like none of us boys in the Greenfield</v>
<v Speaker 1>family actually have the gene that</v>

1229
00:56:59.441 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 1>allows us to generate appreciable</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of vitamin D from sunlight.</v>

1230
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So we all now supplement with vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin K,</v>

1231
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 1>my boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of them possess the enzyme or</v>

1232
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1233
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is an enzyme superoxide</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismutase.</v>

1234
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a gene that allows for increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of this enzyme that allows</v>

1235
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:20.260
<v Speaker 1>for glutathione production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1236
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So they take glutathione now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1237
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:27.780
<v Speaker 1>they have the one that results in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower than normal level of bdnf,</v>

1238
00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 1>brain derived neurotrophic factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's like miracle grow for</v>

1239
00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they use lion's mane extract now</v>

1240
00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 1>before school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1241
00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:41.371
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of doing a genetic test</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing a blood test and looking at</v>

1242
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what your ancestors would have eaten if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you happen to have,</v>

1243
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess kind of like a clean enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret ancestral profile to be able</v>

1244
00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:50.471
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1245
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly northern European so this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to do well On.</v>

1247
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 1>You combine all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1248
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning to your question about the</v>

1249
00:57:57.521 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 1>carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to eat this apoe e four</v>

1250
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:04.180
<v Speaker 1>is also leaves you predisposed to ct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

1251
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:04.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Or you have that higher risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got the April e three m three</v>

1253
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 1>four three four eight four four is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's more concerning.</v>

1254
00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get a very deleterious response</v>

1255
00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 1>in many cases to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fats.</v>

1256
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an inflammatory response to</v>

1257
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:21.830
<v Speaker 1>fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very similar,</v>

1258
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:24.250
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had familial</v>

1259
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 1>hypercholesterolemia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and you get on like a a Kenogenic Diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1261
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and your cholesterol goes up to 500 I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that's something that just doesn't</v>

1262
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:35.140
<v Speaker 1>agree with a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss.</v>

1264
00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's body really does respond</v>

1265
00:58:40.121 --> 00:58:42.320
<v Speaker 1>differently to all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>diets and yeah,</v>

1266
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they don't have a lot of</v>

1267
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:47.260
<v Speaker 1>research in the field.</v>

1268
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 1>If they don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're not,</v>

1269
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 1>they haven't read a lot about it to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine what's the best diet for</v>

1270
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1271
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

1272
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:59.520
<v Speaker 1>There are specific characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>though that regardless of macronutrient</v>

1273
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:04.741
<v Speaker 1>ratios and regardless of food</v>
<v Speaker 1>composition you see over and over again</v>

1274
00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:09.781
<v Speaker 1>in centenarians or in people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a blue zone or people who have</v>

1275
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:13.870
<v Speaker 1>the absence of a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disease risk factors or are high risk</v>

1276
00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:17.380
<v Speaker 1>of mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we see regular periods of caloric</v>

1277
00:59:17.381 --> 00:59:20.950
<v Speaker 1>restriction like at some point other</v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed feeding window or</v>

1278
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the Mediterranean diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody talks about goat cheese and</v>

1280
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:29.300
<v Speaker 1>all of oil and fish and eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not a lot of people talk about the</v>

1281
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>religious aspect of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes certain periods of time</v>

1282
00:59:32.691 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 1>where you fast certain periods of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't eat meat certain days,</v>

1283
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 1>where where you aren't drowning all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>food in olive oil.</v>

1284
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1285
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1286
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1287
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>in terms of other characteristics that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

1288
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycaemic variability,</v>

1289
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see very low periods of glucose</v>

1290
00:59:56.361 --> 01:00:00.320
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations occurring throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day because of a high intake of either</v>

1291
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 1>fiber or legumes is a big one that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in the blue zones,</v>

1292
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like high intake of things like lentils.</v>

1293
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And Split Mung beans and a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that get thrown under the bus now</v>

1294
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>where we're talking about lectins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got damaged,</v>

1295
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately returning back to what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier,</v>

1296
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>soaking and sprouting and fermentation</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a lot of those things.</v>

1297
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Can I pause?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are not aware of that.</v>

1298
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>What are the issues with lectins and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue with Lectins,</v>

1299
01:00:23.211 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and this is based on a on a book that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was published I think about two years</v>

1300
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>ago called the plant paradox by doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven gundry and he talks about how</v>

1301
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>lectins are these builtin natural plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense mechanisms that are in primarily</v>

1302
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:43.541
<v Speaker 1>plants and seeds and the skins of</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain fruits and vegetables that will</v>

1303
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>cause your digestive track to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged or give you a deleterious or</v>

1304
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response to that food.</v>

1305
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a similar argument as the Paleo</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make,</v>

1306
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1307
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:53.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1308
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>don't eat dairy because that could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory proteins in it that might</v>

1309
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:01.931
<v Speaker 1>cause an autoimmune reaction or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>donate bread because of the gluten and</v>

1310
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the phytic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when when you step back and you look</v>

1311
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>out a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of blue zones,</v>

1312
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of longevity hotspots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of centenarians,</v>

1313
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't see avoidance of these foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see smart preparation of them,</v>

1314
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hunt,</v>

1315
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't set up in a tree with a like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dagger and your teeth like Peter Pan and</v>

1316
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>jump out of the tree on the back of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer and,</v>

1317
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start eating the deer,</v>

1318
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to go through a pretty</v>

1319
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>long process of tracking and stalking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hunting and,</v>

1320
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>and Phil dressing and quartering.</v>

1321
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And even then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty intensive cooking</v>

1323
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>process and we do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>like coffee rubs and things to decrease</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of carcinogens in the meat</v>

1325
01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:47.870
<v Speaker 1>when you cook it and we dry age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll take the organ meats and soak</v>

1326
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>them in lemon juice or buttermilk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove the flavor and blah,</v>

1327
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But stop,</v>

1328
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

1329
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1330
01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I forget.</v>

1331
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Coffee rubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>

1332
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>how does it decrease the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>carcinogens?</v>

1333
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Well Coffee Rosemary time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these things that we use as</v>

1334
01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>rubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the benefits of them as they</v>

1335
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>decrease the formation of a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>carcinogenic compounds in the meat,</v>

1336
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the burnt,</v>

1337
01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>charred components of the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's an antioxidant,</v>

1338
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>

1339
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you could just go on your spice cover</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start to make up rubs based on this</v>

1340
01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.024
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

1341
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Anything that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>these sirtuin precursors that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about now for anti aging,</v>

1343
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>like blueberries and red wine and dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate and dark purple fruits and</v>

1344
01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

1345
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you dry those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you powder those,</v>

1346
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a great rub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1347
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Because all of a sudden you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreasing the carcinogenics aspects of</v>

1348
01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>burnt meet or charred meat or are</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily cooks proteins particularly.</v>

1349
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is you want to prepare your</v>
<v Speaker 1>food in a manner that renders it</v>

1350
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>digestible and that unlocks the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients.</v>

1351
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And so when we talk about dietary</v>
<v Speaker 1>customization,</v>

1352
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>not only do you see calorie restriction</v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed feeding windows,</v>

1353
01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:01.140
<v Speaker 1>fasting as one element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that regardless of the Diet that you</v>

1354
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>choose has been shown to improve health</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lifespan.</v>

1355
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 1>But you also see low amounts of glycemic</v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

1356
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 1>You see a high amount of emphasis placed</v>
<v Speaker 1>on rendering the food digestible.</v>

1357
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it is that you're eating.</v>

1358
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.580
<v Speaker 1>And so whether you're eating a ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet or a carnivore diet or a high carb,</v>

1359
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high fat,</v>

1360
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:22.050
<v Speaker 1>low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>

1361
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you try to choose real</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable food,</v>

1362
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 1>then you render that digestible and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat as many different food groups as you</v>

1363
01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:35.781
<v Speaker 1>can eat based on self experimentation</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily until you land on that diet</v>

1364
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that that works well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can combine that with self</v>

1365
01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>qualification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood biomarkers,</v>

1366
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.870
<v Speaker 1>look at your microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at your genetics.</v>

1367
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no reason that that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people shouldn't just be able to eat the</v>

1368
01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>diet that works for their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hard thing to discover the,</v>

1369
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>works best for you.</v>

1370
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Look what feels best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people start convincing themselves,</v>

1371
01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing is more beneficial to the</v>

1372
01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>other and that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wonder about,</v>

1373
01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>this whole carnivore thing.</v>

1374
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they mind fucking themselves or</v>

1375
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they're giving themselves a placebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit of only eating this way and you</v>

1376
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>just go to Sean Baker's instagram every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and you hashtag meet heels and</v>

1377
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.084
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1378
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 1>meets healing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start the,</v>

1379
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a religion.</v>

1380
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a nutrition is highly religious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic.</v>

1381
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carnivore diet people are the exact</v>

1382
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:28.730
<v Speaker 1>opposite of the Vegan people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same but different there.</v>

1383
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.430
<v Speaker 1>They're all just preaching that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should only meat and meets the thing and</v>

1384
01:04:32.431 --> 01:04:37.431
<v Speaker 1>you know they're mocking vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegans are mocking the cow or you know,</v>

1385
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>saying disparaging things about people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who eat meat.</v>

1386
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really seminal issue is the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing though.</v>

1387
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that when you start on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly restrictive diet that tends to be</v>

1388
01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to only eat meat.</v>

1389
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to only eat vegetables.</v>

1390
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>You feel pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you feel a difference.</v>

1391
01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible not to feel a difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you go,</v>

1392
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 1>go completely myopic on your diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a very limited number of food</v>

1393
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we know that vegans buildup deficits</v>

1394
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>and creating in taurine in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1395
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:13.491
<v Speaker 1>unless the reading log and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and Dha and epa in fatty acids and</v>

1396
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term deficits and cortisol which</v>

1397
01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>affects cell membranes,</v>

1398
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's dudes like you know for</v>

1399
01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>can rich roll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1400
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Like great guy and he and and he's into</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1401
01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fermentation,</v>

1402
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 2>soaking and sprouting and super foods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1403
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's honestly kind of expensive and time</v>

1404
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>consuming to do a Vegan diet the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1405
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>But you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't,</v>

1406
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>but if you're not careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build up deficits longterm even</v>

1407
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:41.360
<v Speaker 2>though you feel really good short term</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the same thing with,</v>

1408
01:05:41.361 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>with something like a carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're probably going to build up</v>

1409
01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 2>some kind of microbiome bacterial</v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies unless you're eating the</v>

1410
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>intestines of ruminants or I suppose</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementing with some kind of really</v>

1411
01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>good probiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fascinating because they find</v>

1412
01:05:54.611 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 2>these people that have been doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>

1413
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull these folks out of the woods,</v>

1414
01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:58.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1415
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:00.450
<v Speaker 2>we've got this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing it for 18 years.</v>

1416
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Look how healthy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell,</v>

1417
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:04.950
<v Speaker 2>show someone doing chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is you,</v>

1418
01:06:04.951 --> 01:06:08.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't really hear about that die or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't really hear about that diet</v>

1419
01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>until like three or four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1420
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 2>And much more so over the last two years</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably because of me accidentally</v>

1421
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.620
<v Speaker 2>having all these people on and talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and it's,</v>

1422
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Jordan that have had,</v>

1423
01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to deny the benefits</v>

1424
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>that he's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy looks fantastic and just a</v>

1425
01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:25.590
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1426
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.210
<v Speaker 2>but to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is most likely because of it,</v>

1427
01:06:29.211 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 2>an elimination diet and whatever was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with him before.</v>

1428
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:33.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1429
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:37.780
<v Speaker 2>most people that start off with a poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>die and then switch to a restricted</v>

1430
01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to be better because</v>

1431
01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that's poor and they don't</v>

1432
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:44.110
<v Speaker 2>have the trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have all the sugar,</v>

1433
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't have all the nonsense.</v>

1434
01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's probably causing a good deal of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information in the first place.</v>

1435
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:53.250
<v Speaker 2>So by eliminating all those bad things</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their diet and then concentrating</v>

1436
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:57.130
<v Speaker 2>on the one thing that they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only one thing that they're eating,</v>

1437
01:06:57.131 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 2>you think the one thing they're eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>is causing all the benefits when it's</v>

1438
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 2>probably the lack of the bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1439
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fancy elimination diet,</v>

1440
01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a delicious one.</v>

1441
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of delicious,</v>

1442
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.890
<v Speaker 2>are you hunting at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1443
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your hunt?</v>

1444
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm going through the two elk</v>

1445
01:07:14.951 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 2>that I've given away a lot of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I shot last year,</v>

1446
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 2>every year I scheduled to elk hunts and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1447
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:23.650
<v Speaker 2>assume I'm going to strike out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1448
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last two years I've been very lucky</v>

1449
01:07:25.961 --> 01:07:29.350
<v Speaker 2>and I got to elk each year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's breaking the rules of the secret</v>

1450
01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:30.550
<v Speaker 2>in think and grow rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 2>to assume you're going to strike out.</v>

1452
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Well I supposed to sit cross legged in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your son and manifest that shows.</v>

1453
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work hard but I assume it's a hard</v>

1454
01:07:41.441 --> 01:07:45.520
<v Speaker 2>thing to do to fucking it is and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't realize they don't and he'll,</v>

1455
01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>he'll look at a clip like there's clips</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me online and the clip is like a</v>

1456
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>minute long and it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

1457
01:07:50.741 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 2>look how easy you don't see stalking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>for hours.</v>

1458
01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the hundreds of hours of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting arrows.</v>

1459
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 2>The coaching from John Dudley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the reading,</v>

1460
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.060
<v Speaker 2>archery articles and understanding what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping your mindset clear in the</v>

1461
01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of difficult to long haul.</v>

1462
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:11.980
<v Speaker 2>My boys have their first hunt in three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months and we'll kind of,</v>

1463
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:15.530
<v Speaker 2>we've been prepping for seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing bow hunt and Kona real</v>

1464
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

1465
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

1466
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>she's going to have to sheep or is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to pay the 10?</v>

1467
01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So when you're getting him a crossbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1468
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right now they're shooting a</v>

1469
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>hoyts ignite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1470
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting at about 25 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice shooting at about 40 yards.</v>

1471
01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And how many people live in prepping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're about 45 now,</v>

1472
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>which is going to be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

1473
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean there's still,</v>

1474
01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

1475
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>when they draw their pointing up Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they've still got a couple more</v>

1476
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>months of training to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really get dialed in.</v>

1477
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1478
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

1479
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't even gotten my elk bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

1480
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent my last time,</v>

1481
01:08:53.181 --> 01:08:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I spent six days up in the Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain range and the,</v>

1482
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1483
01:08:57.561 --> 01:09:00.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they called the Santa De Cristo</v>

1484
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the last day I finally came in on</v>

1485
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 1>elk and it was dark and I shot and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed.</v>

1486
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And that was after seven fricking days</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying.</v>

1487
01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And you walk out your horse out</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely empty handed.</v>

1488
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>It's about 45 yards in dusk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1489
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it goes.</v>

1490
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 1>You're shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so dark.</v>

1491
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:22.724
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1492
01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways though,</v>

1493
01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:27.860
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do Kona,</v>

1494
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>actually gonna get you in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dudley,</v>

1495
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>cause I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in touch with him.</v>

1496
01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 1>We've talked before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how you shoot.</v>

1497
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>You shoot with a finger trigger to fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1499
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.730
<v Speaker 1>it's on my list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1500
01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.280
<v Speaker 2>there's those moments like that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1501
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you're hunting for six days and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>trekking through the woods 20 miles a</v>

1502
01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:49.660
<v Speaker 2>day and you're exhausted and you finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that one moment.</v>

1503
01:09:49.661 --> 01:09:54.661
<v Speaker 2>There's so much weight on that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's so difficult to stay focused</v>

1504
01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:58.330
<v Speaker 2>entirely on the task of executing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot perfectly.</v>

1505
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.710
<v Speaker 2>And there's methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Joel Turner who has,</v>

1506
01:10:02.711 --> 01:10:06.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a website called iron mine</v>

1507
01:10:06.011 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

1508
01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1509
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.890
<v Speaker 2>he's an instructor for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1510
01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first responders and snipers and things</v>

1511
01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:15.610
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iron mind,</v>

1512
01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:16.860
<v Speaker 2>iron mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's she live?</v>

1513
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a Pacific northwest guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1514
01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's helped me tremendously.</v>

1515
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.170
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his methods.</v>

1516
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:26.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all about keeping a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1517
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:29.710
<v Speaker 2>the difference between an open loop</v>
<v Speaker 2>system in a closed loop system.</v>

1518
01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Be Able to control it and stop it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop the process anytime you want and</v>

1519
01:10:34.211 --> 01:10:37.660
<v Speaker 2>keeping yourself in that versus like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball bat swing,</v>

1520
01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.580
<v Speaker 2>which is once you start swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just swinging.</v>

1521
01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maintain the present nt,</v>

1522
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.560
<v Speaker 2>to have a mantra and he gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mantra to chant and to think about it in</v>

1523
01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:50.280
<v Speaker 2>terms of controlling all of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>

1524
01:10:50.281 --> 01:10:53.640
<v Speaker 2>So you are in control constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

1525
01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you develop your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is to talk yourself through</v>

1526
01:10:57.401 --> 01:11:00.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your excitable mind take over.</v>

1527
01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll just with it up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he freak out and you pull the trigger</v>

1528
01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:06.910
<v Speaker 2>and you shoot fucking over the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and you don't even know what</v>

1529
01:11:06.911 --> 01:11:08.010
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your mantra?</v>

1530
01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Lost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1531
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull back and I say dry.</v>

1532
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I through all the steps in my head that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to do,</v>

1533
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I actually modified his and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and went to John Dudley's.</v>

1534
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has his own one,</v>

1535
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>which is a drawback in aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it done,</v>

1536
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 2>watch it to keep it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea is just keeping those</v>

1537
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>things in your head.</v>

1538
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.100
<v Speaker 2>So you have one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what would dudley,</v>

1539
01:11:35.101 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I go through all the different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he says,</v>

1540
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:42.110
<v Speaker 2>like a drawback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tip of the nose center,</v>

1541
01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>the peep center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bubble pulled through the shot,</v>

1542
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:45.541
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>

1543
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the shop break.</v>

1544
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 2>And so I go through all those things in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind.</v>

1545
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 2>But the whole idea is that not allow the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freak out.</v>

1546
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause the freak out is what causes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>target panic.</v>

1547
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And when you have that itchy trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>finger with the finger trigger,</v>

1548
01:11:57.751 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 2>you look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1549
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

1550
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it,</v>

1551
01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it.</v>

1552
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Arrow goes in the spot.</v>

1553
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>You know where you're yanking it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling it.</v>

1554
01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 2>He's not very precise and want to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to where it's a surprise shock.</v>

1555
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And when it's a surprise shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just concentrating entirely on</v>

1556
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 2>the area that you want to hit on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ALC.</v>

1557
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Your form is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's aligned in order.</v>

1558
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you let down if it's not you let down</v>

1559
01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 2>and tried to get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was trained to hunt competitions.</v>

1560
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Helped me out quite a bit I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like a three day shoot but they</v>

1561
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.990
<v Speaker 2>were churning around here getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>

1562
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

1563
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're uh,</v>

1564
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 2>they do have part of it as like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an obstacle course race with your</v>

1565
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:42.230
<v Speaker 2>bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then part of it too is just a three</v>

1566
01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:43.710
<v Speaker 2>day shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

1567
01:12:43.711 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a a 40 target three day shoot where</v>

1568
01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:51.630
<v Speaker 2>one shot might be on facing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the targets behind me and you've got</v>

1569
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:56.631
<v Speaker 2>a ten second time span to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn and shoot or you got to take a shot</v>

1570
01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.480
<v Speaker 2>seeded through the trees at 40 yards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then within 20 seconds to a shot at 60</v>

1571
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:04.560
<v Speaker 2>yards.</v>

1572
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of hunting scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would tell you that that is going to</v>

1573
01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:10.680
<v Speaker 2>cause target panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that whole thing of shoot now that</v>

1574
01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 2>you should never just do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should always execute the shot</v>

1575
01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even he doesn't even like this fucking</v>

1576
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing,</v>

1577
01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:20.280
<v Speaker 2>this a techno hunt that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done.</v>

1578
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that that thing causes target</v>

1579
01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:25.350
<v Speaker 2>panic because you only have a brief</v>
<v Speaker 2>window and you're like go,</v>

1580
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes that you should concentrate</v>

1581
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 2>entirely on the correct fundamentals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>execution of archery.</v>

1582
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:36.260
<v Speaker 2>And then with time and understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation,</v>

1583
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 2>the experience of hunting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when those moments present</v>

1584
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to execute correctly.</v>

1585
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when you have this like 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

1586
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 2>you've got to turn and behind your back</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready go.</v>

1587
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:48.680
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1588
01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to hit that.</v>

1589
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:51.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hammer that trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put that pin on the</v>

1590
01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 2>target and hammer that trigger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

1591
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you are emphasizing all the wrong things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could do when you're hunting.</v>

1592
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1593
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Let me go to Hawaii next month and do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep.</v>

1594
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Which island?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Big island.</v>

1595
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It'd be Kona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kona.</v>

1596
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I like to go down there cause you</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can double into spare fish.</v>

1598
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 2>So we'll do sheep and goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pig,</v>

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:31.860
<v Speaker 2>So while the doctor on the trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the one I'm excited about is a</v>

1604
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:35.540
<v Speaker 2>dall sheep up in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to do that.</v>

1605
01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 2>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a float hunt.</v>

1606
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>So you're floating about 40 miles down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the river up there.</v>

1607
01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.460
<v Speaker 2>You fly into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fair banks and there's a fort that</v>

1608
01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:48.820
<v Speaker 2>you fly in from there on a charter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be dall sheep,</v>

1609
01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Caribou and grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a 10 day hunt.</v>

1610
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.200
<v Speaker 2>And this is a bow hunt as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be a bulb while be all pack.</v>

1611
01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1612
01:14:57.530 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 2>got a Smith and Wesson 44.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big ass gun.</v>

1613
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 2>So I'll pack that and then I'll probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a to 72.</v>

1614
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.591
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

1615
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:06.890
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can make weight,</v>

1616
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>you hunt them or weapons or you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding them?</v>

1617
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hunting dall sheep like that.</v>

1618
01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what I really want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just an adventurous,</v>

1619
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not much of a trophy hunting guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am an adventure guy.</v>

1620
01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go out and have an amazing</v>

1621
01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:23.100
<v Speaker 2>adventure wilderness adventure because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1622
01:15:23.101 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place where these things live is</v>

1623
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>some of the fucking sketchy as ground on</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1624
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:32.770
<v Speaker 2>It's shale rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it you have to,</v>

1625
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you're wearing crampons</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your boots.</v>

1626
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 2>You going to extremely high altitude in</v>
<v Speaker 2>precarious situations.</v>

1627
01:15:39.431 --> 01:15:42.470
<v Speaker 2>These little cliff peaks long packouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1628
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a carer will be tag and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly tag as well.</v>

1629
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.640
<v Speaker 2>So if I like to shoot a grizzly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's charging you or to shoot a grizzle</v>

1630
01:15:51.691 --> 01:15:53.860
<v Speaker 2>cause you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would actually be to harvest and</v>

1631
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:56.530
<v Speaker 2>eat a grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually pretty,</v>

1632
01:15:56.531 --> 01:15:57.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like that.</v>

1633
01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at those dall sheep.</v>

1634
01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1635
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is an adventure right there to</v>

1636
01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 2>be able to get to those little specks on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rock.</v>

1637
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So hard to be floating the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1638
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 2>will be fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got Arctic char up there.</v>

1639
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>few other fish.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Beautiful Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.460
<v Speaker 2>So he gets a big fatty fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold water,</v>

1642
01:16:17.461 --> 01:16:21.510
<v Speaker 2>it'll be about 10 to 12 days and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just fly all the meat out and fly</v>

1643
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:22.300
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

1644
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Now grisly as a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a thing that where people are</v>

1645
01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:28.270
<v Speaker 2>hearing this and they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1646
01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Donnie Vinson on the podcast who's</v>

1647
01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:33.790
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a really interesting guy,</v>

1648
01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>very educated and really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really articulate and really like,</v>

1649
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 2>like Rinella and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a great job of explaining what</v>

1650
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>hunting truly is about and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation aspect of it.</v>

1651
01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:48.970
<v Speaker 2>But he's a big fan of eating bear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always telling people like,</v>

1652
01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're all good.</v>

1653
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Like if you prepare correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bears good.</v>

1654
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the trick is to,</v>

1655
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of the glands early on when</v>
<v Speaker 2>your field dressing.</v>

1656
01:16:57.611 --> 01:17:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Cause apparently that taints to meet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've,</v>

1657
01:17:00.301 --> 01:17:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I've never feel dressed to bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

1658
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:03.700
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1659
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.040

01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:23.450
<v Speaker 2>north fork of the clearwater big steel</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1695
01:18:23.451 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean those things are massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snagged.</v>

1696
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.250
<v Speaker 2>One's not supposed to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1697
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.210
<v Speaker 2>He's supposed to let them go.</v>

1698
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:31.100
<v Speaker 2>It depends there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain,</v>

1699
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I forget that I forget the color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain style of steelhead</v>

1700
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 2>that you are allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to throw this one back.</v>

1701
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ones that we were yelling to</v>

1702
01:18:38.811 --> 01:18:41.090

<v Speaker 2>I kind of understand it,</v>

1704
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ocean bound rainbow trout,</v>

1705
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno man.</v>

1708
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain variety that you</v>

1709
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 2>actually can't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1710
01:18:53.871 --> 01:18:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat it physically,</v>

1711
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.280
<v Speaker 2>but you're now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1712
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1713
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:03.710
<v Speaker 2>that seems so strange to me is the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the population because</v>

1714
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 2>they're in the process of breeding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to interrupt,</v>

1715
01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:08.900
<v Speaker 2>but you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain mortality rate that</v>

1716
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:10.460
<v Speaker 2>they're accepting with catch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

1717
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons why I have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with that and I've done catch and</v>

1718
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.140
<v Speaker 2>release fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to appear like I'm a</v>

1719
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.620
<v Speaker 2>hypocrite because it is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a thing about it is like</v>

1720
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:22.330
<v Speaker 2>you're just shoving a hook and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things face and then releasing them.</v>

1721
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:26.930
<v Speaker 2>That is why I like spear fishing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're underwater.</v>

1722
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.750
<v Speaker 2>You're going after the exact fish that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

1723
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:33.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt in your mind I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shoot that fish and it,</v>

1724
01:19:33.161 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not wondering what's going to</v>

1725
01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:35.670
<v Speaker 2>bite the hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1726
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Like whether it's going to be illegal</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or an illegal one,</v>

1727
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether you get a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1728
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.380
<v Speaker 2>You're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the coral,</v>

1729
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.341
<v Speaker 2>you're getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:47.840
<v Speaker 2>You're going down and up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the,</v>

1731
01:19:47.841 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>there's all like if you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitness,</v>

1732
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 2>the cold thermogenesis and the breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold and the spleen compression and the</v>

1733
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>red blood cell production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's a,</v>

1734
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1735
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Zen.</v>

1736
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let my daughter do it</v>

1737
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:01.790
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's too young.</v>

1738
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:04.610
<v Speaker 2>They said you have to be 13 so just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spear fish.</v>

1739
01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could probably be like shallow water</v>

1740
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>with a slang and</v>

1741
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to do it is you want to</v>

1742
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.830
<v Speaker 1>start off shore eight to 15 feet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1743
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to easy slang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1744
01:20:15.831 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think spear and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of like the big roller guns that</v>

1745
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you gotta like put the handle against</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chest and pull back.</v>

1746
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to dive to depths,</v>

1747
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:26.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1748
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:30.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're going after tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be able to go like 30 plus</v>

1749
01:20:30.241 --> 01:20:33.390
<v Speaker 1>feet and you have a floater and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very involved process.</v>

1750
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you're just like in fricking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii and you've got a sling and a good</v>

1751
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>spot and some coral and some good fans</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can just basically swim away.</v>

1752
01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tie a string around my waist and</v>

1753
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.060
<v Speaker 1>pull a knife on my belt and he can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there and you know,</v>

1754
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.360
<v Speaker 1>string four or five fish and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy day.</v>

1755
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:52.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a ton of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:20:52.811 --> 01:20:55.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fishing.</v>

1757
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:57.720
<v Speaker 1>He'd called Spear Phishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you basically hunting underwater,</v>

1758
01:20:57.721 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 1>hunting underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even have the,</v>

1759
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you've seen these,</v>

1760
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 1>these underwater bows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1761
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you can shoot a bow at the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Had a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they called bow fishing</v>

1763
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 1>or what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>

1764
01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I've seen something like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1766
01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a lot of both fish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people do the shooting down at</v>

1767
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Phillip and alligator Gar in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

1768
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:19.710
<v Speaker 1>They use it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1769
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smoked rarely.</v>

1770
01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a such a weird looking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost seems like in my mind it</v>

1771
01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 1>almost feels like it shouldn't shoot it</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a dinosaur.</v>

1772
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Keep it alive because they really</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't changed in millions of years.</v>

1773
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a freaky look.</v>

1774
01:21:33.831 --> 01:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They're fun to prepare though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a fish feed after spearfish or all</v>

1775
01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:37.920
<v Speaker 1>cold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hungry.</v>

1776
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Last one I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

1777
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 1>we had a pair of fish down Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed with avocado and mango coconut</v>

1778
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:47.010
<v Speaker 1>oil paint baked in the oven with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macadamia nut.</v>

1779
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Like in cross the Macadamia nut parrot</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish are the ones that are eating the</v>

1780
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 1>coral and shitting out white sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1781
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that you've watched more</v>

1782
01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:58.320
<v Speaker 1>nature tv than I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what white sand is.</v>

1783
01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 1>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1784
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not.</v>

1785
01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1786
01:22:02.191 --> 01:22:06.040
<v Speaker 1>These fish eat coral chew it up and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the white sand.</v>

1787
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So like a giant white sand beach like</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearwater,</v>

1788
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all fish parrot.</v>

1789
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Fish poop makes beautiful beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1790
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 1>There's the article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer.</v>

1791
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's good for your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's good for your</v>

1792
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 1>microbiome out on bacteria.</v>

1793
01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:21.540
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers are out there just</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating rocks.</v>

1794
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>

1795
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of pair of fish over a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

1796
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go on a ship,</v>

1797
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 1>like here you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see them,</v>

1798
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.890
<v Speaker 1>they're chewing on the coral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Bang it out.</v>

1799
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 1>They have like a beak essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're calling parrot fish.</v>

1800
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>They smashed down that coral and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that white around them is,</v>

1801
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:41.190
<v Speaker 1>they're just basically swimming around</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own shit.</v>

1802
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1803
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange like that.</v>

1804
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1805
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1806
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.170
<v Speaker 1>metformin you started talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

1807
01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Sinclair.</v>

1808
01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.240
<v Speaker 1>He can take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1809
01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And the foreman maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1810
01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems weird because that one's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

1811
01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the darling of the antiaging</v>

1812
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.160
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like a nickel a pop and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1814
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 1>inhibits m talk to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the big deal with that is his</v>

1815
01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>glycaemic variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced risk of chronic disease.</v>

1816
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of side effects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1817
01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to mention that to you saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's none.</v>

1818
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lactic acidosis and it inhibits</v>

1819
01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

1820
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 1>electron transport chain in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria,</v>

1821
01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:26.550
<v Speaker 1>which is fine if you want to down</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate metabolism live a long time and</v>

1822
01:23:26.551 --> 01:23:28.670
<v Speaker 1>not if you not if you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1823
01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to inhibit mitochondrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>respiration necessarily.</v>

1824
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin B 12 deficiencies like it's</v>

1825
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>derived from French [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians for for hundreds of years</v>

1826
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>been using it but in limited quantities</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it induces nausea,</v>

1827
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd say get gastrointestinal</v>

1828
01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 1>disturbances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1829
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.760
<v Speaker 1>my take on metformin cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

1830
01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking over the past year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of these anti aging compounds</v>

1831
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that people are now using or talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about using like wrap a myosin and</v>

1832
01:23:58.061 --> 01:24:03.061
<v Speaker 1>metformin and Nad and a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sirtuin precursors but metformin and</v>

1833
01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>rapamycin actually for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for different reasons because that's an</v>

1834
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:11.941
<v Speaker 1>immune system suppressor are two that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think I would ever take really.</v>

1835
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause with metformin there are a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of natural compounds that reduce blood</v>

1836
01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:22.150
<v Speaker 1>glucose and improve insulin sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the absence of that,</v>

1837
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:25.120
<v Speaker 1>like Berberine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a curcumin,</v>

1838
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 1>apple cider vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sail on cinnamon bitter melon extract,</v>

1839
01:24:29.410 --> 01:24:32.620
<v Speaker 1>and you think all those things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimicking what metformin is capable of</v>

1840
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:33.700
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1841
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not wearing it right now,</v>

1842
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but usually I wear a Dexcom g six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a continuous blood glucose monitor.</v>

1843
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 1>It actually fell off yesterday when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing that exercise.</v>

1844
01:24:41.891 --> 01:24:45.370
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those ones who see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetics where there was still sends my</v>

1845
01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:48.490
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose to myself on all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things like,</v>

1846
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blood glucose would spike in the</v>

1847
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:54.370
<v Speaker 1>mornings like clockwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 8:00 AM every morning.</v>

1848
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is my blood glucose going to one</v>

1849
01:24:57.041 --> 01:24:59.410
<v Speaker 1>2130 every single morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1850
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a cup of coffee in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though I don't put cream or</v>

1851
01:25:03.161 --> 01:25:04.750
<v Speaker 1>sugar in my coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just drink straight up.</v>

1852
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Black coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee actually causes your liver to</v>

1853
01:25:07.661 --> 01:25:09.730
<v Speaker 1>engage in something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycogenolysis.</v>

1854
01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 1>So you actually release glucose into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream,</v>

1855
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's why you drink coffee.</v>

1856
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 1>You want that Cortisol release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that glucose hit.</v>

1857
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want the flavor and the</v>

1858
01:25:18.281 --> 01:25:21.100
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would get a blood glucose response</v>

1859
01:25:21.101 --> 01:25:22.230
<v Speaker 1>from coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1860
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 1>another one that surprised me was green</v>
<v Speaker 1>beans.</v>

1861
01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about legumes.</v>

1862
01:25:26.681 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You talk about slow release</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and it falls into that</v>

1863
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my blood glucose would go up</v>

1864
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:35.980
<v Speaker 1>whenever I'd have green beans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I actually got a food allergy tests</v>

1865
01:25:35.981 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>through this company called Cyrex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did like a really good food allergy</v>

1866
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 1>test that doesn't give you this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>laundry list of false positives like uh,</v>

1867
01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like the Elisa and the owl cat</v>

1868
01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the skin prick tests,</v>

1869
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:50.530
<v Speaker 1>you just get like a very small number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods that you're actually allergic to.</v>

1870
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of these other tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll show a bunch of antibodies to</v>

1871
01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's antibodies to foods.</v>

1872
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:57.940
<v Speaker 1>You're eating that food are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people would be like,</v>

1873
01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.750
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1874
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm allergic to eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a test on allergic to eggs and I'm</v>

1875
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 1>depressed because that was a big staple</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my diet.</v>

1876
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only showing that you're allergic</v>

1877
01:26:05.211 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>to them cause they were a staple in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet because you're eating a lot of eggs</v>

1878
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>and you're winding up with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those egg proteins in your bloodstream.</v>

1879
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:13.071
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1880
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrex panel.</v>

1881
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So basically if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating a lot of eggs,</v>

1882
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you actually have a lot of egg proteins</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulating in your bloodstream.</v>

1883
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a food panel,</v>

1884
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you actually can very readily produce it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a food allergy panel.</v>

1885
01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 1>You produce antibodies to the egg</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein and they say that you're</v>

1886
01:26:32.841 --> 01:26:36.440
<v Speaker 1>allergic to the egg protein when in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have a lot of egg proteins in</v>

1887
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.300
<v Speaker 1>your system because you've been eating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of eggs.</v>

1888
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they'll even test the</v>
<v Speaker 1>white blood cell reaction to a raw egg,</v>

1889
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.750
<v Speaker 1>not a cooked egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1890
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And so your white blood cells are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to react more readily to a raw egg</v>

1891
01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 1>versus cook dagger raw chicken versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook Chicken.</v>

1892
01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a lot of these food</v>
<v Speaker 1>allergy panels were that accurate for</v>

1893
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1894
01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just giving you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>laundry list of foods that you may or</v>

1895
01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:01.160
<v Speaker 1>may not be allergic to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one is called,</v>

1896
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's called Cyrex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1897
01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I have no financial affiliation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like that with his company but I</v>

1898
01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 1>just think they do a good job with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>

1899
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to order through a physician and</v>

1900
01:27:10.161 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I ordered this test and I was allergic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to almost nothing like barely anything</v>

1901
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 1>would spike for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like kind of like a moderate spike for</v>

1902
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:18.320
<v Speaker 1>gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1903
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:23.380
<v Speaker 1>green beans l were off the chart off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chart so that continuous blood glucose</v>

1904
01:27:23.961 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 1>monitor was actually able to tell me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was eating something that my</v>

1905
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic nervous system was</v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to.</v>

1906
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I was going to fight and flight mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing a bunch of glucose and I never</v>

1907
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 1>would have really known that or gotten a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue about that unless I was wearing one</v>

1908
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 1>of these continuous blood glucose</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitors.</v>

1909
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to wear my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to wear it.</v>

1910
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.440
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my plan is to wear for a year to just</v>

1911
01:27:45.441 --> 01:27:47.840
<v Speaker 1>learn a lot about the foods that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually eat,</v>

1912
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>what they do to my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what certain workouts do,</v>

1913
01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what certain supplements do.</v>

1914
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:56.660
<v Speaker 1>But returning to Metformin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to use a lot of these things</v>

1915
01:27:56.661 --> 01:27:58.330
<v Speaker 1>like bear Brene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like curcumin.</v>

1916
01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 1>You can do a shot of apple cider vinegar</v>
<v Speaker 1>before a meal,</v>

1917
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:04.160
<v Speaker 1>take a couple of teaspoons of sale on</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinnamon in your smoothie.</v>

1918
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And these things actually have an effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>on blood glucose that mimics what you're</v>

1919
01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:10.700
<v Speaker 1>trying to get when you take metformin.</v>

1920
01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.580
<v Speaker 1>That but without the side effects is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just limiting blood glucose.</v>

1921
01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned earlier,</v>

1922
01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 1>it does inhibit mtor low bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1923
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get that,</v>

1924
01:28:19.011 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 1>that mtor inhibition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can inhibit mtor tore through</v>

1925
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 1>like calorie restriction and fasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>done regularly or like a compressed</v>

1926
01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:27.350
<v Speaker 1>feeding window should add you here</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

1927
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.091
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1928
01:28:28.091 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1929
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I should have had you here to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Davidson.</v>

1930
01:28:31.210 --> 01:28:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to finish listening to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview too because he,</v>

1931
01:28:33.471 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart guy,</v>

1932
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not enamored with metformin.</v>

1933
01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not an APP.</v>

1934
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more natural alternatives.</v>

1935
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 1>He's not an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He barely works out and a lot of side,</v>

1936
01:28:44.661 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does like a little bit of a run,</v>

1937
01:28:46.371 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could tell he's not,</v>

1938
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:52.310
<v Speaker 1>he's not a guy who's really exerting</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself rigorously.</v>

1939
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.610
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the marriage of performance and</v>

1940
01:28:55.611 --> 01:28:57.980
<v Speaker 1>longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live a long time.</v>

1941
01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 1>If I can't kick ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>

1942
01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be cold and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Libido lists and left home 150 like</v>

1943
01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that means I'm going to live</v>

1944
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 1>till I'm 145 instead of 150 right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause Cause I've got more muscle mass or</v>

1945
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to feel good.</v>

1946
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So whenever I'm looking at a compound</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1947
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm questioning whether or not it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way to go if it's going to</v>

1948
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:21.500
<v Speaker 1>inhibit my actual performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1949
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 1>His focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's natural alternatives.</v>

1950
01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.570
<v Speaker 1>He's so focused on longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:27.840
<v Speaker 1>But you could say that about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

1952
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cryotherapy,</v>

1953
01:29:29.641 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 1>chambers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1954
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the Cherokee,</v>

1955
01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 1>native American tribe would dip their</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies and icy cold water to La were</v>

1956
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:41.100
<v Speaker 1>like two years old or the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

1957
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.220
<v Speaker 1>the viral video footage of the Siberian</v>
<v Speaker 1>school children.</v>

1958
01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've seen this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1959
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 1>they rush out into the snow during</v>
<v Speaker 1>recess and their underpants and they</v>

1960
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 1>dump cold water on themselves and run</v>
<v Speaker 1>around in the snow and then come back</v>

1961
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:56.391
<v Speaker 1>inside and in Iceland based on some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research that was done a few decades</v>

1962
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 1>ago on immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let their babies sleep outside and</v>

1963
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 1>like subzero temperatures in strollers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1964
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:05.730
<v Speaker 1>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the finish,</v>

1965
01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:08.350
<v Speaker 1>the eastern European and they've all got</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1966
01:30:08.351 --> 01:30:10.350
<v Speaker 1>their cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Baltic Sea,</v>

1967
01:30:10.351 --> 01:30:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back and forth and I go to</v>

1968
01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the men's Finnish Sauna</v>

1969
01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no crowd there be chambers and</v>

1970
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:19.110
<v Speaker 1>it was just old school saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go jump in the sea and you</v>

1971
01:30:19.111 --> 01:30:21.360
<v Speaker 1>dry yourself off in the air that you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the sauna.</v>

1972
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:26.930
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's natural turnitin Jz and I get</v>

1973
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:32.340
<v Speaker 1>flack a lot of the time cause I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm one of these so called bio</v>

1974
01:30:32.341 --> 01:30:33.210
<v Speaker 1>hackers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1975
01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I have like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laser lights in my office that I</v>

1976
01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:41.400
<v Speaker 1>shine on my balls and I've got like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the lights that go in your ears</v>

1977
01:30:41.401 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1978
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 1>the the stem cells and Ivs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>injections.</v>

1979
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 1>But I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always want to make sure people know</v>

1980
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:52.350
<v Speaker 1>that you go after the natural stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1981
01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 1>But like natural ways to get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural ways to get hot.</v>

1982
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to buy some expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulsed electromagnetic field,</v>

1983
01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sure as hell better be going outside</v>

1984
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:03.480
<v Speaker 1>barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1985
01:31:03.481 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Like or camping or sleeping outside or</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to earth and ground in a</v>

1986
01:31:07.021 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 1>more natural way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is involved in earthing and</v>

1987
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:13.430
<v Speaker 1>grounding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real pickle?</v>

1988
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 1>There is research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in terms of a reduction in</v>

1989
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:19.530
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and improvement in joint</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort.</v>

1990
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you take the same</v>

1991
01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:26.520
<v Speaker 1>frequency so that the earth naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>emits somewhere in the range of about</v>

1992
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>three to a hundred hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic frequencies like way</v>

1993
01:31:30.481 --> 01:31:31.314
<v Speaker 1>lower than that.</v>

1994
01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million hertz frequencies are getting</v>

1995
01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:34.500
<v Speaker 1>when you're holding your cell phone up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your ear.</v>

1996
01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:37.440
<v Speaker 1>But we're walking around on basically a</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant electrical matt,</v>

1997
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's radiation,</v>

1998
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic frequencies released by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth,</v>

1999
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that these fancy devices</v>
<v Speaker 1>now these mats that you could sleep on</v>

2000
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>or do therapy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2001
01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:50.040
<v Speaker 1>there's been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got one in my basement that just</v>

2002
01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>packs a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who was using the race horsing</v>

2003
01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>industry for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a pulse centers and you lay</v>

2004
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>on that thing and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrates your whole body.</v>

2005
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:00.243
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2006
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it reduces inflammation and you think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like exercise for your cells.</v>

2007
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's opening and closing the cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>membrane.</v>

2008
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting this blood flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a poult centers.</v>

2009
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant table pulse center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got different coils.</v>

2010
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:12.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2012
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it's poults pulled centers is the name</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the company.</v>

2013
01:32:15.371 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sirs or sense sense centers since the</v>

2014
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.670
<v Speaker 1>doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got like a attachments like</v>

2015
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>coils and pads that you can attach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knee or attached to like a bum</v>

2016
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 1>shoulder or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just sit in there and and work on</v>

2017
01:32:28.181 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>my computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a massage on it every week for a</v>

2018
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's taking the same frequencies you</v>

2019
01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>get from the earth and just magnifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2020
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>just delivering them in a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated manner.</v>

2021
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with like a like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrared light panel.</v>

2022
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've seen these</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2023
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 1>They deliver near infrared far infrared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red light.</v>

2024
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 1>People will strip off their clothes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand in front of these things to get</v>

2025
01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:54.370
<v Speaker 1>more college in production or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same way that that light that I</v>

2026
01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:57.940
<v Speaker 1>was talking about for your head can</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance mitochondrial activity in neural</v>

2027
01:32:57.941 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 1>tissue or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your balls are basically little eyes.</v>

2028
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 1>They have photo receptors on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they respond to light.</v>

2029
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You can actually increase mitochondrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity in the testicles,</v>

2030
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 1>in the Leydig cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the testes to increased testosterone</v>

2031
01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 1>or increased sperm production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you shoot a light in your balls and</v>

2032
01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:14.620
<v Speaker 1>all the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grow more tests.</v>

2033
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You'd go outside and you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd sunbathing nude or you'd use one</v>

2034
01:33:17.441 --> 01:33:18.570
<v Speaker 1>of these lights and just standing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2035
01:33:18.571 --> 01:33:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

2036
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:21.730
<v Speaker 1>look like an idiot at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I do.</v>

2037
01:33:21.731 --> 01:33:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I've got a light panel in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2038
01:33:25.391 --> 01:33:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm at a standing desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at a standing desk.</v>

2039
01:33:27.521 --> 01:33:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I've got a light panel behind me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for 20 minutes,</v>

2040
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I just take my clothes off at work and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand sandwiched in between these light</v>

2041
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:38.770
<v Speaker 1>panels and it basically blast me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this red light.</v>

2042
01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.590
<v Speaker 1>But I also go out in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2043
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've got the option to do that versus</v>

2044
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 1>get outside in the sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out into the sunlight.</v>

2045
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 1>If I've got the option to take Berberine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bitter melon extract instead of</v>

2046
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Metformin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather take the bear rain in the</v>

2047
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:57.040
<v Speaker 1>bitter melon extract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's just strips up down and</v>

2048
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:59.800
<v Speaker 1>go as natural as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you step up to the more</v>

2049
01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:00.730
<v Speaker 1>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2050
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 1>anti aging strategies or bio hacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies or what have you,</v>

2051
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you still have to look at those with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical eye and ask yourself whether</v>

2052
01:34:08.501 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 1>or not those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are really safe or if they have</v>

2053
01:34:10.961 --> 01:34:12.410
<v Speaker 1>side effects that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2054
01:34:12.411 --> 01:34:14.140
<v Speaker 1>in many cases limit your physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

2055
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And why do you prefer the standing desk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

2056
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:21.100
<v Speaker 1>the whole sitting is the new smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2057
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2058
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I think sitting is just fine.</v>

2059
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Like it feels natural to set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like you're breaking</v>

2060
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:30.550
<v Speaker 1>some rule of the human body to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're sitting down right now.</v>

2061
01:34:30.551 --> 01:34:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It feels pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem was sitting is that that is</v>

2062
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the posture most people are adopting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours per day.</v>

2063
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best position to be in when you're</v>

2064
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:43.690
<v Speaker 1>working would be whatever position</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in at the moment.</v>

2065
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.491
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

2066
01:34:44.491 --> 01:34:48.340
<v Speaker 1>when you look at weight training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would not apply to hypertrophy,</v>

2067
01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>which would dictate that you want to hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>a muscle over and over again using the</v>

2068
01:34:51.761 --> 01:34:54.550
<v Speaker 1>same angle with increasingly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>loads.</v>

2069
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:57.010
<v Speaker 1>But for metabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2070
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to actually throw curve</v>

2071
01:34:59.181 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 1>balls at your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2072
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 1>You had the best workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore would be the one that you're</v>

2073
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>not doing right now if your goal was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just to limit any type of metabolic</v>

2074
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:06.944
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>

2075
01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.450
<v Speaker 1>So the idea with the standing desk is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that to give me yet another</v>

2076
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 1>position to be in during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got to,</v>

2077
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I've got a true form treadmill and I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>true form modify.</v>

2078
01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It's take the dashboard off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got that in front of my standing</v>

2079
01:35:19.821 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 1>workstation and then I've got one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these balance boards that I can stand on</v>

2080
01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and I've got like a stool that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean against.</v>

2081
01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 1>So I've got all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions that I can be in during the</v>

2082
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.431
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I've got that,</v>

2083
01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that a poult centers chair in my office</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can go and sit in.</v>

2084
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:37.790
<v Speaker 1>So every 25 minutes I'll just shift to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different position.</v>

2085
01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And My standup desk is a hand crank</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up desk so I can crank it up and</v>

2086
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:44.590
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do want to sit at my desk and just,</v>

2087
01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:45.950
<v Speaker 1>it just works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2088
01:35:45.951 --> 01:35:46.784
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2089
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of hacking your</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

2090
01:35:49.041 --> 01:35:52.160
<v Speaker 1>of equipping your environment to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many different positions as possible.</v>

2091
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:54.980
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the key to feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at work,</v>

2092
01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:57.590
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're stuck indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe in one of those,</v>

2093
01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever seen one of those?</v>

2094
01:35:59.241 --> 01:36:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2095
01:36:00.271 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stand at your standing desk on this</v>

2096
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 2>variable sort of surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those things where it's</v>

2097
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:08.210
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's topographical,</v>

2098
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Matt as Matt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll call it</v>

2099
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:14.950
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one like in our boulder offices from</v>

2100
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 1>my company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got the standup desks that go up.</v>

2101
01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push a button and they go up and</v>

2102
01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what we have is just scattered</v>

2103
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>around the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few of those mats,</v>

2104
01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 1>we've got some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've seen these</v>

2105
01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:28.010
<v Speaker 1>fluids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance things.</v>

2106
01:36:28.011 --> 01:36:31.010
<v Speaker 1>They're like Kinda like skateboards that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand on top of,</v>

2107
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:33.880
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as gnarly as a balanced</v>

2108
01:36:33.881 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can still focus while you're</v>

2109
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 1>standing on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2110
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got some different stools,</v>

2111
01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:42.290
<v Speaker 1>different chairs that will go up or</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2112
01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're in a corporate office,</v>

2113
01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it surprises me how many people in</v>

2114
01:36:46.911 --> 01:36:48.740
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their corporate offices don't equip</v>

2115
01:36:48.741 --> 01:36:51.410
<v Speaker 1>their employees just to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move during the day.</v>

2116
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2117
01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the most people aren't using</v>

2119
01:36:55.141 --> 01:36:57.060
<v Speaker 2>ergonomic chairs either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.600
<v Speaker 2>What do you use as your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as your main chair for Ergonomic Chair,</v>

2121
01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:02.040
<v Speaker 2>these chairs that we ask when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in,</v>

2122
01:37:02.041 --> 01:37:03.540
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I sitting in right now?</v>

2123
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Pisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's by a company feel like I'm not</v>

2124
01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:09.960
<v Speaker 2>using it to its full capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>

2125
01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:12.870
<v Speaker 2>what's the purpose of the way that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>has shaped back of this?</v>

2126
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Of Lean on it in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your elbows on it if you like,</v>

2127
01:37:16.921 --> 01:37:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but it encourages you to have an upright</v>
<v Speaker 2>posture.</v>

2128
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I've got this thing called a Mogo</v>
<v Speaker 2>upright.</v>

2129
01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:26.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a stool and I can even travel with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cause it will compress.</v>

2130
01:37:26.011 --> 01:37:29.370
<v Speaker 2>It weighs about two pounds and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually lean against that and get into</v>

2131
01:37:29.371 --> 01:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>some different positions on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is a company that sent us something.</v>

2132
01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:37.110
<v Speaker 2>They have one that's basically almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sana spring where you kind of have</v>

2133
01:37:37.111 --> 01:37:42.111
<v Speaker 2>to balance yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to activate more just to be one</v>

2134
01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 2>of those at a chiropractic event once</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2135
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like kind of makes you squeeze your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pelvis while you're in the chair.</v>

2136
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.360
<v Speaker 2>But there's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this dude in Finland.</v>

2137
01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a company called Sally s a l.</v>

2138
01:37:57.691 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 2>L.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2139
01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>He used to ride horses and he decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start making chairs that would get him</v>

2140
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>into the same upright position that he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2141
01:38:05.131 --> 01:38:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And we have riding a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2142
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a saddle chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2143
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I have one of those two that revs up my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen table.</v>

2144
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 2>That's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still uncomfortable though.</v>

2145
01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2146
01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like your balls are sandwiched</v>

2147
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 2>in between these two planks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the arm rods so you can spend</v>

2148
01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:23.670
<v Speaker 2>around if you want to sit like ac slater</v>
<v Speaker 2>style at the,</v>

2149
01:38:23.671 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>like he's what's Ac slider style chair</v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>

2150
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's AC slater in my head.</v>

2151
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 2>That isn't those saddle chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

2152
01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 2>they've got like Little Allen keys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>come with them.</v>

2153
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 2>And you can adjust to to your pelvic</v>
<v Speaker 2>width?</v>

2154
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:40.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it mean it fits my width.</v>

2155
01:38:40.021 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

2156
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those sorts of injections you've</v>

2157
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:45.120
<v Speaker 2>been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give her big ass wide pelvis.</v>

2158
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Don't say on your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my main chair for a long time</v>

2159
01:38:49.521 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 2>but saddled to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I started using these</v>

2160
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 2>capisce co chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more comfortable.</v>

2161
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Well if you're sitting for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2162
01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2163
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:59.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy and I have no back pain when I</v>

2164
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:02.430
<v Speaker 2>use a regular office chair and I sit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>long periods of time,</v>

2165
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I get that center back pain from just</v>
<v Speaker 2>just poor posture,</v>

2166
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:09.870
<v Speaker 2>just sitting in a curved stance or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>curved up position.</v>

2167
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:12.180
<v Speaker 2>What about a treadmill desk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried one of those.</v>

2168
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>See I can't do a lot on treadmill desk</v>
<v Speaker 2>production wise,</v>

2169
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm ever let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody is interviewing me like on</v>

2170
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:23.600
<v Speaker 2>skype on a podcast while I'm doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consult call with somebody reviewing</v>

2171
01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.690
<v Speaker 2>blood work or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be walking on my treadmill.</v>

2172
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 2>And then I've got my microphone in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me and I have this program called</v>

2173
01:39:31.411 --> 01:39:36.411
<v Speaker 2>dragon dictation and dragon dictation</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows me to talk via like a headset and</v>

2174
01:39:37.321 --> 01:39:39.260
<v Speaker 2>then it'll type the words on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>

2175
01:39:39.261 --> 01:39:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Is that a long time ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently the accurate leaps and</v>

2176
01:39:42.421 --> 01:39:44.190
<v Speaker 2>bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2177
01:39:44.191 --> 01:39:46.680
<v Speaker 2>it's called training your dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the software tells you to train</v>

2178
01:39:46.681 --> 01:39:49.080
<v Speaker 2>your dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you say all these words,</v>

2179
01:39:49.081 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 2>you read all these paragraphs and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>learns to identify your phrasing,</v>

2180
01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.110
<v Speaker 2>the volume of your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets more accurate.</v>

2181
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:57.410
<v Speaker 2>But it's way better than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the Builtin Apple,</v>

2182
01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever's kind of voice recognition</v>

2183
01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:01.800
<v Speaker 2>software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it works.</v>

2184
01:40:01.801 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that because then I can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>

2185
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk emails,</v>

2186
01:40:05.821 --> 01:40:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I can talk with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like three or four different</v>

2187
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 2>things that I do at work that I will</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk doring yeah,</v>

2188
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:12.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2189
01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:17.370
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I write when I'm just completely alone</v>

2190
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:20.270
<v Speaker 2>and quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staring at a computer because uh,</v>

2191
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to spend time on each individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>word and really concentrate on what the</v>

2192
01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 2>fuck I'm saying cause it most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I'm writing standup so I need to</v>

2193
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.310
<v Speaker 2>bounce it back and forth and to talk it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2194
01:40:32.311 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not really the right strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2196
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on a book right now and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've found is for me,</v>

2197
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I have to have a triggered environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a place in my house that when I go</v>

2198
01:40:44.881 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 2>to that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the place where your mind says,</v>

2199
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:50.890
<v Speaker 2>okay this is the riding spot for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2200
01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this chair in the corner of the</v>

2201
01:40:53.891 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>living</v>

2202
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 1>room outside my office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I get into that thing,</v>

2203
01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like writing mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2204
01:40:58.460 --> 01:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

2205
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I just go Pomodoro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ride for 25 minutes,</v>

2206
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a five minute break,</v>

2207
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's how I do it.</v>

2208
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause I just have an environment to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write in an environment and a good time,</v>

2209
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 1>like a specific time to write as good</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2210
01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:12.431
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2211
01:41:12.431 --> 01:41:13.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's x amount,</v>

2212
01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:14.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's x time.</v>

2213
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.731
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I,</v>

2214
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:16.650
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind 'em you'll haul</v>

2216
01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.800
<v Speaker 1>this new research they're doing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morning Nis eveningness uh,</v>

2217
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:27.870
<v Speaker 1>chronotypes different people being night</v>
<v Speaker 1>owls versus morning larks even.</v>

2218
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2219
01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2220
01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>it was a study I was looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday about the response to like an</v>

2221
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory stress or I don't remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the stressor was,</v>

2222
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but like when a morning type is stressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the morning,</v>

2223
01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 1>they handle it better than when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressed out in the evening and vice</v>

2224
01:41:46.931 --> 01:41:47.764
<v Speaker 1>versa.</v>

2225
01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting,</v>

2226
01:41:49.091 --> 01:41:51.820
<v Speaker 1>this research on chronotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of just,</v>

2227
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:55.840
<v Speaker 1>just being able to shift your circadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm because I travel a lot.</v>

2228
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't been home at 17 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got two more days on the road and</v>

2229
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:00.700
<v Speaker 1>then I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be home.</v>

2230
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:03.490
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm going east to west or west</v>
<v Speaker 1>to east,</v>

2231
01:42:03.491 --> 01:42:08.491
<v Speaker 1>I use light a lot to reset my circadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and called a Zeit guiders.</v>

2232
01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these are,</v>

2233
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 1>these are cues that regulate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>circadian biology.</v>

2234
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So like eating is one you want to wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat until it's actual mealtime and</v>

2235
01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever area of the world that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling too.</v>

2236
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you arrive in whatever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City from California,</v>

2237
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:29.830
<v Speaker 1>3:00 PM you don't want to eat a bite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>food until like 7:00 PM when it's actual</v>

2238
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:31.210
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that helps to regulate your</v>

2239
01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:32.080
<v Speaker 1>circadian rhythm.</v>

2240
01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Movement is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to get outside,</v>

2241
01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 1>go for a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for a swim,</v>

2242
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:39.730
<v Speaker 1>go hit the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that that's a big one for me.</v>

2243
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:42.310
<v Speaker 1>When I went to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I'd do is I check in.</v>

2244
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I go right to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually sat outside,</v>

2245
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I take off my shoes and go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good to be good for me.</v>

2246
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Like a rigorous workout makes all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the world in terms of like</v>

2247
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:57.151
<v Speaker 1>how I actually feel if I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm traveling a lot and doing shows</v>

2248
01:42:57.401 --> 01:42:59.090
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't want to,</v>

2249
01:42:59.091 --> 01:43:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you get to a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just want to lay down and relax.</v>

2250
01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to defy that urge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2251
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I'd just go straight to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I find.</v>

2252
01:43:06.131 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2253
01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.640
<v Speaker 1>if he shut up the inner bitch and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it through the first two minutes,</v>

2254
01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:10.503
<v Speaker 1>you're good to go.</v>

2255
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:13.570
<v Speaker 1>But light is the biggie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light is the biggie.</v>

2256
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:18.220
<v Speaker 1>So I've got like the of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these buds that make light that go on my</v>

2257
01:43:18.221 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 1>ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make light into your ear and you</v>

2258
01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:22.380
<v Speaker 1>have photo receptors in your ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2259
01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Photo receptors all over your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you wear a sleep mask to</v>

2260
01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:27.550
<v Speaker 1>go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to make the room dark</v>

2261
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.500
<v Speaker 1>cause you got photo receptors on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

2262
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I've got the one that I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that I wear on my head.</v>

2263
01:43:33.810 --> 01:43:36.100
<v Speaker 1>That one was called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one's called a v Lie.</v>

2264
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>The one that goes in your ears is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human charger.</v>

2265
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And then I've got the one that goes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyes,</v>

2266
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that one's called a re timer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one makes like this greenish</v>

2267
01:43:44.681 --> 01:43:47.590
<v Speaker 1>blue light that's not damaging to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>retina,</v>

2268
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but that just blast your entire skull</v>
<v Speaker 1>with light.</v>

2269
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:53.840
<v Speaker 1>So I've got light on my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light on my ears,</v>

2270
01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of my head and I'll flip those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights on back in front of the body and</v>

2271
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:01.690
<v Speaker 1>that's my home set up to get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>circadian rhythm restore.</v>

2272
01:44:01.691 --> 01:44:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It's what I do is if I've been back east</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2273
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and my body at s 4:00 AM Pacific time is</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me it's 7:00 AM because I'm on</v>

2274
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 1>eastern time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My circadian clock is on eastern time.</v>

2275
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.510
<v Speaker 1>What I do is I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lay in bed for three</v>

2276
01:44:17.511 --> 01:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait and wait until the time when I</v>

2277
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 1>actually do want to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do is I wake up,</v>

2278
01:44:21.651 --> 01:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I get out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I put on those blue light blocking</v>

2279
01:44:24.351 --> 01:44:26.370
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that you're supposed to wear at</v>

2280
01:44:26.371 --> 01:44:27.590
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2281
01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the yellowish orange lenses,</v>

2282
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but I block all light.</v>

2283
01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So I'm basically just walking around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty dim setting in my house.</v>

2284
01:44:34.491 --> 01:44:36.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make coffee sometimes or have some</v>

2285
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:37.700
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch out,</v>

2286
01:44:37.701 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 1>get some work done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got the light block the whole</v>

2287
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:44.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then whenever the time rules around</v>

2288
01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:46.570
<v Speaker 1>when I actually want to start waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2289
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm like 6:00 AM I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wake up at 4:00 AM want wake up at</v>

2290
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:53.630
<v Speaker 1>6:00 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll go down in my office and I'll</v>

2291
01:44:53.631 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 1>put on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the ear thing,</v>

2292
01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>the head thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light in front of the picture light</v>

2293
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 1>behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to see if [inaudible] on an ige</v>

2294
01:45:02.331 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>story before and then you just blast</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself like 20 minutes.</v>

2295
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And if I do that for two or three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my circadian rhythm just right back</v>

2296
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 1>on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right back on time.</v>

2297
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 1>And I and I fall asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm supposed to fall asleep.</v>

2298
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to bed at like 10:00 PM I get up</v>

2299
01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:21.500
<v Speaker 1>about 6:00 AM and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my cycle every day.</v>

2300
01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:23.770
<v Speaker 1>But I just blast myself with light when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

2301
01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.820
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of food is a good one,</v>

2302
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:28.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you use some sort of fasting</v>

2303
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:29.280
<v Speaker 1>in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2304
01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:32.210
<v Speaker 1>to regulate everything when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling and then exercise.</v>

2305
01:45:32.211 --> 01:45:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And then eating after after rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 1>training puts everything sort of back</v>

2307
01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 1>into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you fast,</v>

2308
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:42.170
<v Speaker 1>what's your fasting protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 hours every night.</v>

2309
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Every single night now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One or two nights a week I'll fuck off.</v>

2310
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:49.400
<v Speaker 1>What about like longer fests during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't at all?</v>

2311
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:50.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't done that.</v>

2312
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I started last year to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my protocol now is 12 to six hours of</v>

2314
01:45:56.211 --> 01:45:58.100
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fast every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas,</v>

2315
01:45:58.101 --> 01:45:59.300
<v Speaker 1>thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it like.</v>

2316
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:01.340
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I stopped and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

2317
01:46:01.341 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll set my watch.</v>

2318
01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:05.180
<v Speaker 1>If I finish eating at 8:00 PM I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat again until 8:00 AM.</v>

2319
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:07.880
<v Speaker 1>If I finish eating at midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>

2320
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat again until you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gibbon midnight,</v>

2321
01:46:10.551 --> 01:46:12.650
<v Speaker 1>first snack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't eat again until lunch at least</v>

2322
01:46:12.651 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>12:00 PM so I do that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started doing,</v>

2323
01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:19.760
<v Speaker 1>once valter Longo came out with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>research on the longevity diet and this</v>

2324
01:46:19.761 --> 01:46:23.840
<v Speaker 1>whole idea of a fasting mimicking diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing cellular autophagy and</v>

2325
01:46:23.841 --> 01:46:27.920
<v Speaker 1>enhancing longevity to the same extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you were just do like a pure water</v>

2326
01:46:27.921 --> 01:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>fast or stop eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is on a quarterly basis,</v>

2327
01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:34.940
<v Speaker 1>four times a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were strict the normal amount of</v>

2328
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:38.600
<v Speaker 1>calories that you would eat to 40% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd normally eat.</v>

2329
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just dropping one meal or</v>

2330
01:46:41.991 --> 01:46:45.110
<v Speaker 1>for every meal that you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating a little bit less and you</v>

2331
01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:48.200
<v Speaker 1>do this for five days on a quarterly</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

2332
01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I started doing that last year and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have like this stew that I make</v>

2333
01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>with split Mung beans and Basmati rice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's called a,</v>

2334
01:46:55.471 --> 01:46:58.500
<v Speaker 1>it's called kitchery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an Indian Ayurvedic Cleansing Stew,</v>

2335
01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Dr Logos company L Nutra sends out these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kits called prolonged kits that are all</v>

2336
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:07.050
<v Speaker 1>done for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just wanted to,</v>

2337
01:47:07.051 --> 01:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make my own stew.</v>

2338
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 1>That's easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a little coconut yogurt on it and</v>

2339
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.910
<v Speaker 1>that's just breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch and dinner for me for five days in</v>

2340
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:15.960
<v Speaker 1>a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a,</v>

2341
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 1>like a seasonal cleaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do that four times a year.</v>

2342
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And the only other thing that I do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two times a month.</v>

2343
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I try to go from Saturday dinner to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday dinner without eating.</v>

2344
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost a 24 hour fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with those three things,</v>

2345
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:35.060
<v Speaker 1>12 six and Ironman fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quarterly five day like modified</v>

2346
01:47:35.071 --> 01:47:39.180
<v Speaker 1>fast and then the 24 hour fast one to</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times a month.</v>

2347
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:41.940
<v Speaker 1>That's sustainable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could still perform,</v>

2348
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I could still work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2349
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way to go.</v>

2350
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.360
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel when you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 hour fast?</v>

2351
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a pretty good workout at</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:00 PM you get hungry the 2:00 PM in</v>

2352
01:47:52.291 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause what I'll do is I'll have dinner</v>

2353
01:47:54.751 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 1>on Saturday and then I'll wait the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and then I'll have a big Sunday</v>

2354
01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.190
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And honestly,</v>

2355
01:47:59.191 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't affect the workouts that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the magic of fasting seems to be</v>

2356
01:48:03.601 --> 01:48:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the compressed feeding window and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the calorie restriction,</v>

2357
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This returns to not wanting to be hungry</v>

2358
01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and cold and libido lists if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to live a long time.</v>

2359
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you could fast from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner and</v>

2360
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 1>have a giant ribeye steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potato fry,</v>

2361
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red wine,</v>

2362
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 1>dark chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halo,</v>

2363
01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:23.820
<v Speaker 1>top ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you,</v>

2364
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:26.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want at the end of the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Sunday,</v>

2365
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.450
<v Speaker 1>eat 3,500 calories and then you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're topped off and you're ready for</v>

2366
01:48:30.451 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the next day and you have a long period</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which you're engaged in cellular</v>

2367
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 1>cleanup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cellular autophagy.</v>

2368
01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:37.380
<v Speaker 1>But he kind of get to have your cake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it too,</v>

2369
01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:38.820
<v Speaker 1>cause you have a bunch of calories at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of that.</v>

2370
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Are you drinking coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So coffee's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually surprised you didn't ask</v>

2372
01:48:44.971 --> 01:48:48.240
<v Speaker 1>me when I brought in the sourdough bread</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the and the coconut macaroons and</v>

2373
01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:50.850
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they would take you out of Ketosis or</v>

2374
01:48:50.851 --> 01:48:54.170
<v Speaker 1>break your fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that question a lot now when</v>

2375
01:48:54.171 --> 01:48:56.610
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's put dominant people,</v>

2376
01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to know if the butter in</v>

2377
01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 1>your coffee and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a hundred calories of butter in</v>

2378
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:03.600
<v Speaker 1>your coffee is going to break your fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

2379
01:49:03.601 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 1>The idea is if it has calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it breaks your fast.</v>

2380
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't break your fast zero</v>

2381
01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's negligible.</v>

2382
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like a few cholesterol molecules</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like the where they call a coffee</v>

2383
01:49:15.661 --> 01:49:18.090
<v Speaker 1>stall and the we all and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even that,</v>

2384
01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 1>if you use the paper filter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're filtering a lot of that out.</v>

2385
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why I like French press</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not filtering some of those</v>

2386
01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:27.000
<v Speaker 1>like brain spinning compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you fucked around with any of that</v>

2387
01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:29.940
<v Speaker 1>four sigmatic mushroom coffee and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved that stuff.</v>

2388
01:49:29.941 --> 01:49:32.040
<v Speaker 1>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually before I came over here,</v>

2389
01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I had a cup of coffee and I had a packet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that four sigmatic Mane.</v>

2390
01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get it for cognition.</v>

2391
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

2392
01:49:38.761 --> 01:49:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been drinking there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those little packets.</v>

2393
01:49:40.770 --> 01:49:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

2394
01:49:41.751 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a sponsor now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

2396
01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Good Fan Taro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives down in Venice beach.</v>

2397
01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:48.483
<v Speaker 1>Smart Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2398
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.580
<v Speaker 1>they do place for a guy that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom coffee.</v>

2399
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:52.760
<v Speaker 1>They do a good job with their mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2400
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that has calories going to take</v>

2401
01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you out of fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll drink a black coffee,</v>

2402
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:59.980
<v Speaker 1>green tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those enhance your fatty acid</v>

2403
01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:02.200
<v Speaker 1>burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually enhancing the benefits</v>

2404
01:50:02.201 --> 01:50:03.034
<v Speaker 1>of a fast.</v>

2405
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally if I'm going to do a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>epic workout,</v>

2406
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:12.300
<v Speaker 1>the two things that I'll use in combo</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ketone esters with essential amino</v>

2407
01:50:13.331 --> 01:50:15.970
<v Speaker 1>acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You combine though it's very low number</v>

2408
01:50:15.971 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 1>of calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like rocket fuel,</v>

2409
01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:21.890
<v Speaker 1>how much you get done at [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 grams of essential amino acids.</v>

2410
01:50:21.891 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the key tones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've been doing is a shot glass of</v>

2411
01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:29.851
<v Speaker 1>this stuff called a it ketone aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another company called</v>

2412
01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that does like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all taste like ass,</v>

2413
01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but you combine those with like a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of amino acids,</v>

2414
01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:40.180
<v Speaker 1>so you have high ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi amino acids.</v>

2415
01:50:40.181 --> 01:50:43.090
<v Speaker 1>But neither of those are insulinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it still keeps you in a,</v>

2416
01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:47.020
<v Speaker 1>in a relatively fast and state if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to a hard workout or maintain</v>

2417
01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:50.460
<v Speaker 1>muscle or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the mushrooms?</v>

2418
01:50:50.461 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You ever fuck around with those and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing?</v>

2419
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:50:53.201 --> 01:50:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I like cordyceps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to act primarily on some of</v>

2421
01:50:56.921 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the pathways for oxygenation</v>

2422
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 1>blood cell production long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2423
01:51:03.311 --> 01:51:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I've got all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got all the on it and stuff.</v>

2424
01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shroom tech is good.</v>

2425
01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually four sigmatic does,</v>

2426
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 1>does a quarter steps as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other one,</v>

2427
01:51:13.511 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion's Mane,</v>

2428
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.160
<v Speaker 1>what I've been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this about two times a week.</v>

2429
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Stick a very small amount of Siliciden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 0.2 grams of Psilocybin,</v>

2430
01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and you'd take two packets of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion's mane,</v>

2431
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:31.270
<v Speaker 1>the foursigmatic of lion's mane extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then anything that increases blood</v>

2432
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 1>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be like beet root,</v>

2433
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any nitric oxide precursors,</v>

2434
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you could probably try shroom tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2435
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niacin,</v>

2436
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people use Niacin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you combine anything that increases</v>

2437
01:51:44.351 --> 01:51:46.780
<v Speaker 1>blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple map packets of the lion's Mane</v>

2438
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and then about 0.2 grams of Siliciden</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cognitive pick me up you get</v>

2439
01:51:52.571 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>from that is profound.</v>

2440
01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that siliciden increases your</v>

2441
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 1>sensory perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to pick out color,</v>

2442
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:00.370
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

2443
01:52:00.371 --> 01:52:01.570
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2444
01:52:01.810 --> 01:52:04.470
<v Speaker 1>But just for getting through a day of</v>
<v Speaker 1>work or even like going on a,</v>

2445
01:52:04.471 --> 01:52:06.850
<v Speaker 1>on a long hike or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2446
01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I would not be surprised if our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors used silicide for hunting</v>

2447
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:13.540
<v Speaker 1>because you actually do get a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good increase in sensory perception,</v>

2448
01:52:13.541 --> 01:52:16.350
<v Speaker 1>smell and sight from it and visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>acuity as well.</v>

2449
01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that mix works really well where you</v>

2450
01:52:19.331 --> 01:52:21.760
<v Speaker 1>do the lion's mane along with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the width,</v>

2451
01:52:21.761 --> 01:52:24.520
<v Speaker 1>the silicide and extract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that there'd be some sort</v>

2452
01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:27.910
<v Speaker 1>of a symbiotic benefit to combining</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of mushrooms together.</v>

2453
01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2454
01:52:29.141 --> 01:52:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2455
01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:32.950
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doctrine of signatures,</v>

2456
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the idea that what things look like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature could actually give you clues</v>

2457
01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:38.290
<v Speaker 1>about their benefit for the body.</v>

2458
01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 1>And when you find lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2459
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you seen it in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like this cluster of axons</v>

2460
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and Dendrites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it looks like brain cells,</v>

2461
01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up close,</v>

2462
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has look up like lion's Mane,</v>

2463
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad ass looking or like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff like that.</v>

2464
01:52:56.721 --> 01:52:57.554
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2465
01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>there's this place in quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not I go to called quite organic</v>

2466
01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:04.010
<v Speaker 1>pharmacy and they just grow on his tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>little two acre farm.</v>

2467
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.370
<v Speaker 1>All these different superfoods like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2468
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Noni and a cow and they've got comfrey</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2469
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you dig up the root of a comfrey</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant,</v>

2470
01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.320
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2471
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:18.890
<v Speaker 1>that's lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt is created and that night's main</v>

2472
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:22.250
<v Speaker 1>great name for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also looks like dendrites and</v>

2473
01:53:22.251 --> 01:53:25.160
<v Speaker 1>axons and neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very cool.</v>

2474
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2475
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:28.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fritz and placing plan,</v>

2476
01:53:28.190 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I have yet to actually find it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

2477
01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but apparently you can find it up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2478
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 1>up in the inland northwest where I live</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways though.</v>

2479
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Comfrey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it nyt bone and the roots look</v>

2480
01:53:39.441 --> 01:53:44.441
<v Speaker 1>like knuckles and joints and human bones</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very good for healing up</v>

2481
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:47.600
<v Speaker 1>fractures or for making like a plaster</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your joints.</v>

2482
01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.450
<v Speaker 1>A plastic Humphrey plant plaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Well what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that uh,</v>

2484
01:53:52.051 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 1>that pharmacy in Hawaii does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grind it into a powder and then you</v>

2485
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 1>reconstitute that with water and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>smear it over shoulder joint.</v>

2486
01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:01.670
<v Speaker 1>They could just use like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tee shirt or whatever to hold it</v>

2487
01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 1>on there or an ace bandage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it actually increases the speed of</v>

2488
01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:10.070
<v Speaker 1>bone healing or joint healing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an anti inflammatory,</v>

2489
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.890
<v Speaker 1>they do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a muscle cream with the two made</v>

2490
01:54:12.891 --> 01:54:15.410
<v Speaker 1>out of the conferee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very interesting.</v>

2491
01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2492
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things in nature that gives</v>

2493
01:54:18.951 --> 01:54:19.671
<v Speaker 1>you clues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:22.160
<v Speaker 1>like the carrots and the eggs for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

2495
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the walnuts for the brain.</v>

2496
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

2497
01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:30.170
<v Speaker 1>how does that stuff increase your bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing?</v>

2498
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the mechanism?</v>

2499
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2500
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It might be like some way of mineral</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery through the skin,</v>

2501
01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been blown away by CBD by using,</v>

2502
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:42.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2503
01:54:42.570 --> 01:54:44.960
<v Speaker 1>putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting cbd over muscle.</v>

2504
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of companies do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2505
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what the trick with that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys,</v>

2506
01:54:48.411 --> 01:54:52.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the doctors who worked with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France teams when showing me</v>

2507
01:54:52.401 --> 01:54:53.810
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have an electrical muscle</v>

2508
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.160
<v Speaker 1>stimulation unit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2509
01:54:55.170 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I got like a mark pro or a complex or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

2510
01:54:57.501 --> 01:54:58.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a comp.</v>

2511
01:54:58.161 --> 01:55:02.360
<v Speaker 1>So you put your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cbd oil on your magnesium or</v>

2512
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Arnica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your trauma,</v>

2513
01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:07.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're using and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>rub that in and then you put the</v>

2514
01:55:07.851 --> 01:55:12.851
<v Speaker 1>electrodes on top of that and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put an ice pack on top of that.</v>

2515
01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the,</v>

2516
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the cream or lotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the electrodes,</v>

2517
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:23.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the topical thing that holds it on and</v>

2518
01:55:23.241 --> 01:55:27.290
<v Speaker 1>the electricity drives the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory deeper into the</v>

2519
01:55:27.291 --> 01:55:30.560
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it enhances the effect of like a cbd</v>

2520
01:55:30.561 --> 01:55:34.040
<v Speaker 1>oil or magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ice allows you to turn up the</v>

2521
01:55:34.041 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 1>electricity to a higher level without</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting uncomfortable.</v>

2522
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So I do this at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use one called a called a Marc pro and</v>

2523
01:55:40.581 --> 01:55:43.650
<v Speaker 1>just kind of surround the area that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

2524
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:44.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torn or,</v>

2525
01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>or that's painful and I'll do a rub like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2526
01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CVD oil works amazingly for that.</v>

2527
01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is,</v>

2528
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:51.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2529
01:55:51.861 --> 01:55:54.150
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkable because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2530
01:55:54.151 --> 01:55:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you're putting it on the surface of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and it's,</v>

2531
01:55:56.071 --> 01:55:58.260
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how I can get all the way</v>

2532
01:55:58.261 --> 01:56:02.330
<v Speaker 1>deep into a muscle or into a joint like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2533
01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people use it with knee pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

2534
01:56:05.251 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkable how well skin is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

2535
01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why some of those personal care</v>

2536
01:56:09.721 --> 01:56:13.500
<v Speaker 1>products are kind of scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a cbd who just don't care,</v>

2537
01:56:13.501 --> 01:56:14.950
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal care products,</v>

2538
01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:17.260
<v Speaker 1>parabens and phthalates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2539
01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:18.400
<v Speaker 1>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2540
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the Fido estrogens and endocrine</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptors and stuff like that and them,</v>

2541
01:56:21.481 --> 01:56:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2542
01:56:22.411 --> 01:56:23.050
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done,</v>

2543
01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 1>they've done studies where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2544
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.860
<v Speaker 1>like guys will like take a shower with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average shampoo that's got,</v>

2545
01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like parabens and phthalates and these</v>

2546
01:56:31.021 --> 01:56:33.870
<v Speaker 1>things that that can be endocrine</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptors or,</v>

2547
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:38.580
<v Speaker 1>or phytoestrogen you mimic estrogen in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man's body and they actually,</v>

2548
01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:43.610
<v Speaker 1>within a short period of time after</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the shower and using these care</v>

2549
01:56:43.711 --> 01:56:45.960
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually detect this stuff in</v>

2550
01:56:45.961 --> 01:56:48.750
<v Speaker 1>their urine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body is actually soaking this</v>

2551
01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:52.800
<v Speaker 1>up and absorbing it as the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting book.</v>

2552
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed this guy.</v>

2553
01:56:53.970 --> 01:56:58.950
<v Speaker 1>My podcast is called astro generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how many guys have really high</v>

2554
01:56:58.951 --> 01:57:03.750
<v Speaker 1>estrogen levels now from primarily their</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal care products or their</v>

2555
01:57:03.751 --> 01:57:05.340
<v Speaker 1>household cleaning chemicals.</v>

2556
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>

2557
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Trying to turn you into a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2558
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:12.700
<v Speaker 1>it is more or less over a guy's house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see a bunch of sweet smell in</v>

2559
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:14.570
<v Speaker 1>shampoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise me.</v>

2560
01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I raced for,</v>

2561
01:57:15.961 --> 01:57:18.590
<v Speaker 1>for a team Timex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to train out at the,</v>

2562
01:57:18.591 --> 01:57:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the giant stadium in New Jersey and I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the locker room there and it's just</v>

2563
01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:25.020
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that the,</v>

2564
01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the peak of performance and professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports would have started looking into</v>

2565
01:57:30.091 --> 01:57:32.910
<v Speaker 1>by this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you keep testosterone is high</v>

2566
01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:35.730
<v Speaker 1>as possible on a male athletes body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2567
01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:39.810
<v Speaker 1>But you walk into the bathroom and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like every end of can disrupt or</v>

2568
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 1>known to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like lined up in a pretty shiny row</v>

2569
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 1>there on the shelf in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting of the shaving cream and the</v>

2570
01:57:45.841 --> 01:57:47.890
<v Speaker 1>shampoos and the spray deodorant.</v>

2571
01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean any,</v>

2572
01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I did not all shaving cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's,</v>

2573
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:55.980
<v Speaker 1>if it's something that has those kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chemicals in it,</v>

2574
01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.980
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever used Dr Carver's shave</v>

2575
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:01.600
<v Speaker 1>butter and that sounds familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2576
01:58:01.630 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2577
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:04.600
<v Speaker 1>dollar shave club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a product.</v>

2578
01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the most fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible shaving cream of all time.</v>

2579
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll regular shaving cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>

2580
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just won't use it after you try that</v>

2581
01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:15.250
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've tried that because he's s</v>

2582
01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:18.840
<v Speaker 1>this probably happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get lots of lots of personal care</v>

2583
01:58:18.841 --> 01:58:21.460
<v Speaker 1>products since your studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm home.</v>

2584
01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that stuff blows me away.</v>

2585
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like a butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was called the Dr Carver's.</v>

2586
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

2587
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2588
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll get them sent us off to try to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be blown away by.</v>

2589
01:58:31.090 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to shave that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't have him send very much.</v>

2590
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:35.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't grow a lot of [inaudible]</v>

2591
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.180
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of facial hair.</v>

2592
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2593
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:38.521
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2594
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:41.620
<v Speaker 1>these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your experimenting you'd think and</v>

2595
01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 1>think something would have sprouted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd think it'd be kind of weird.</v>

2596
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Like it just be like one right side</v>
<v Speaker 1>patch of the chin and it's like a hair.</v>

2597
01:58:48.821 --> 01:58:50.530
<v Speaker 1>But there is a mole attached to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

2598
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

2599
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It's going to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stem cells bleeding out the end.</v>

2600
01:58:55.530 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Sit in bed occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some of this stuff on stem</v>

2601
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 1>cells that admittedly are a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like adventure into human</v>

2602
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:05.650
<v Speaker 1>experimentation without robust evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of safety.</v>

2603
01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.420
<v Speaker 1>How about the one where you shot onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>your deck?</v>

2604
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example.</v>

2605
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2606
01:59:10.901 --> 01:59:11.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2607
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of shifting my whole philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stem cells to kind of go after stuff</v>

2608
01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:17.540
<v Speaker 1>from my own body as much as possible.</v>

2609
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Being autologous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2610
01:59:20.231 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 1>you're on like that one I did in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>

2611
01:59:21.911 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 1>he says it's not somebody else's blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just my own stuff.</v>

2612
01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases you could argue that</v>

2613
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:32.700
<v Speaker 1>placental or umbilical or amniotic cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so young and so plurry potent,</v>

2614
01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they don't have the,</v>

2615
01:59:37.090 --> 01:59:37.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2616
01:59:37.841 --> 01:59:39.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DNA in the nucleus,</v>

2617
01:59:39.281 --> 01:59:41.680
<v Speaker 1>which apparently they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can kill off somehow,</v>

2618
01:59:41.681 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 1>which is how they make exosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not getting somebody else's</v>

2619
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 1>DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2620
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2621
01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.770
<v Speaker 1>it's just something your body would've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made anyways and recognize itself.</v>

2622
01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2623
01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 1>some sometimes though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2624
01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:58.120
<v Speaker 1>sometimes though I probably have taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too far with a few of those things,</v>

2625
01:59:58.570 --> 01:59:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2626
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but the cbd that you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of,</v>

2627
02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I take cbd before bed every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2628
02:00:06.330 --> 02:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the studies on cbd for</v>

2629
02:00:10.151 --> 02:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and for sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are pushing 100 and up to</v>

2630
02:00:13.961 --> 02:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>900 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nuts.</v>

2631
02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the actual serving size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the average cbd tincture or a capsule</v>

2632
02:00:20.651 --> 02:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>or pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 10 now,</v>

2633
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>so you got to take a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I sleep like a baby.</v>

2634
02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I got the ring that I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sleep squad.</v>

2635
02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I slept eight and a half hours last</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and I take a hundred milligrams of</v>

2636
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>CBD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take a little bit of Melatonin and I'm</v>

2637
02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>just out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to take a lot of,</v>

2638
02:00:37.721 --> 02:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>and you wake up kind of groggy when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do read it.</v>

2639
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>But if you're used to that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get up,</v>

2640
02:00:41.981 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>shake it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later you're good to go.</v>

2641
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the radio was coming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2642
02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>probably just overstimulation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>endocannabinoid system.</v>

2643
02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's like super relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I want to be when I sleep.</v>

2644
02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:52.061
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2645
02:00:52.061 --> 02:00:52.894
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2646
02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

2647
02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>What about regular marijuana?</v>

2648
02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Does that affect your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sleep?</v>

2649
02:00:57.041 --> 02:01:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Do you find it beneficial or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cbd can enhance your deep sleep</v>

2650
02:01:02.261 --> 02:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2651
02:01:04.031 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>which is when a good majority of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuronal repair and recovery occurs.</v>

2652
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>THC allows you to sleep and it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases sleep latency,</v>

2653
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>how long it takes you to fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does reduce the amount of time</v>

2654
02:01:18.251 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you spend in deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2655
02:01:20.291 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those people whose mind</v>

2656
02:01:22.721 --> 02:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>races who's hyper charged up when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2657
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and you got to get to sleep at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use thc light,</v>

2658
02:01:28.991 --> 02:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit a vape pen or whatever,</v>

2659
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but know that you might miss out on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things you want during deep</v>

2660
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory consolidation,</v>

2661
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>neuronal repair and recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2662
02:01:39.651 --> 02:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>nervous system repair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still pretty decent sleep and</v>

2663
02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting as much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction in deep sleep as you would get</v>

2664
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>if you were to be taking like Ambien or</v>
<v Speaker 1>valium or something that's literally</v>

2665
02:01:52.851 --> 02:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>just like a sledge hammer for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex that knocks you out.</v>

2666
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>But you almost get no deep sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do this,</v>

2667
02:01:59.691 --> 02:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>if you were to get like a sleep tracker</v>
<v Speaker 1>and test your deep sleep levels,</v>

2668
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you would find that with cbd you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall asleep as fast,</v>

2669
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but you get higher deep sleep levels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then with thc you can fall asleep</v>

2670
02:02:10.971 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your deep sleep isn't quite as high.</v>

2671
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>When you consider that CBD can</v>
<v Speaker 1>counteract a lot of effects that thc,</v>

2672
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>then that means that what you could try</v>
<v Speaker 1>is take thc to lie to fall asleep</v>

2673
02:02:22.911 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then pile a whole bunch of cbd on</v>

2674
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've done that before too,</v>

2675
02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>were just take a hit on a vape pen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then take a bunch of cbd and you shoot</v>

2676
02:02:30.741 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>for the best of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks that are taking ambient,</v>

2677
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially people that are doing</v>

2678
02:02:36.471 --> 02:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it virtually every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has got to have a profound effect</v>

2679
02:02:40.251 --> 02:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>on your brain's ability to recover.</v>

2680
02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorting themselves on the life who are</v>

2681
02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:47.960
<v Speaker 1>taking ambien or valium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2682
02:02:47.961 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to start with sleep,</v>

2683
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you need to rely on your body's own</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal chemistry and that would be</v>

2684
02:02:54.411 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>breath work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think everybody before they start</v>

2685
02:02:57.231 --> 02:03:01.340
<v Speaker 1>taking whatever phosphatidyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>searing and adaptogenic herbs and all</v>

2686
02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:05.180
<v Speaker 1>this shit for cortisol and before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>start taking valium or Ambien or</v>

2687
02:03:05.181 --> 02:03:08.450
<v Speaker 1>anything else for sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should learn how to control your</v>

2688
02:03:08.451 --> 02:03:11.960
<v Speaker 1>physiology with your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the most powerful way to</v>

2689
02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:13.020
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2690
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you Prawna your shock or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to call it,</v>

2691
02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Speaker 1>like being able to do things like breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

2692
02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>box breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternate nostril breathing,</v>

2693
02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:23.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even even holotropic breathing,</v>

2694
02:03:23.781 --> 02:03:27.710
<v Speaker 1>like you can go some very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>places in terms of dmt production by the</v>

2695
02:03:27.711 --> 02:03:30.720
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by just doing holotropic breathwork.</v>

2696
02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of very interesting things</v>

2697
02:03:33.201 --> 02:03:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that you can do with your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that for getting to sleep or</v>

2698
02:03:37.491 --> 02:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>for decreasing stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start with the breath and then you</v>

2699
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:42.290
<v Speaker 1>start to introduce some of these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>

2700
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But ambien valium like in the era of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like readily available cvd and you know,</v>

2701
02:03:47.031 --> 02:03:48.980
<v Speaker 1>all the other sleep compounds that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have available,</v>

2702
02:03:48.981 --> 02:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>like Valerian and passion flower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mill and you know,</v>

2703
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.960
<v Speaker 1>all of those are what are called gamma</v>
<v Speaker 1>aminobutyric acid or Gaba precursors.</v>

2704
02:03:56.961 --> 02:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>They produce inhibitory</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters.</v>

2705
02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people are still</v>

2706
02:04:01.341 --> 02:04:03.650
<v Speaker 1>taking ambien and valium because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots.</v>

2707
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this addicted to it or they just</v>

2708
02:04:05.631 --> 02:04:06.411
<v Speaker 1>want a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2709
02:04:06.411 --> 02:04:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want some fat in their box and they</v>

2710
02:04:09.411 --> 02:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>want ambien and invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the same folks,</v>

2711
02:04:11.841 --> 02:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but many times it is.</v>

2712
02:04:13.290 --> 02:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's our president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our president takes that shit.</v>

2713
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's sleeping with ambien.</v>

2714
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of politicians do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2715
02:04:20.031 --> 02:04:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Well the can't sleep otherwise they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ruining the world.</v>

2716
02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2717
02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:24.751
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2718
02:04:24.751 --> 02:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I've found that if my brain is racing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely concentrating on</v>

2719
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 1>breathing in and breathing out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on just the breath itself,</v>

2720
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 1>like really being cognizant of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>

2721
02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>deliberate breaths in and out and in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now by doing that over long periods</v>

2722
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2723
02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I've found that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can pretty much calmed myself out.</v>

2724
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>But that takes focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are not willing to learn</v>

2725
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>how to do that because they want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast track out there.</v>

2726
02:04:50.851 --> 02:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>She'll take a drug and pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the thing,</v>

2727
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want a pill.</v>

2728
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unfortunate that those things</v>

2729
02:04:56.881 --> 02:05:00.210
<v Speaker 1>exist in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that sort of thinking is,</v>

2730
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reinforced.</v>

2731
02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2732
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>It's encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2733
02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ads and all these doctors and</v>

2734
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you have a hard time sleeping,</v>

2735
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll just write your prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

2736
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at the animal world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they self medicate,</v>

2737
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they'll use clay for parasites and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2738
02:05:21.091 --> 02:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>dogs leak grasp who stomach issues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2739
02:05:24.071 --> 02:05:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that I guess birds now are putting like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicotine and cigarettes and their nests.</v>

2740
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's some kind of benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2741
02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:35.391
<v Speaker 1>And you see animals self-medicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see our ancestors using everything</v>

2742
02:05:35.881 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:39.330
<v Speaker 1>cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2744
02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.910
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different derivatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For thousands of years.</v>

2745
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:46.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like supplementation or self</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication or the or the whole creation</v>

2746
02:05:46.261 --> 02:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>of pharmaceuticals is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural or not acceptable human</v>

2747
02:05:50.371 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you start to use it as a</v>

2748
02:05:52.441 --> 02:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>crutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where you run into issues</v>

2749
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.230
<v Speaker 1>like once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you deny the human body's ability</v>

2750
02:05:58.231 --> 02:06:03.060
<v Speaker 1>to be able to heal itself or to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to decrease stress on its own,</v>

2751
02:06:03.061 --> 02:06:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you begin to rely on these exogenous</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

2752
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where you start playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fire.</v>

2753
02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder what's happening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds over longterm use of this</v>

2754
02:06:10.951 --> 02:06:14.310
<v Speaker 1>stuff where you're not going into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep sleep cycles and you're using it</v>

2755
02:06:14.311 --> 02:06:16.470
<v Speaker 1>every night because essentially once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hooked on it,</v>

2756
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have a really hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping without it.</v>

2757
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2758
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're shorting themselves.</v>

2759
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:23.604
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2760
02:06:24.130 --> 02:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what studies in the emory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's learning like that.</v>

2761
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:30.300
<v Speaker 1>That's where a lot of that type of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

2762
02:06:30.301 --> 02:06:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>

2763
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.601
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called,</v>

2764
02:06:34.601 --> 02:06:36.540
<v Speaker 1>the glymphatic drainage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

2765
02:06:36.541 --> 02:06:41.010
<v Speaker 1>this new drainage system for the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've just discovered in recent</v>

2766
02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you actually detoxify the</v>

2767
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:48.090
<v Speaker 1>brain during the sleep cycles and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>even enhanced when you sleep on your</v>

2768
02:06:48.091 --> 02:06:50.220
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even looked at sleeping positions</v>

2769
02:06:50.221 --> 02:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>in this thing called glymphatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>drainage.</v>

2770
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And when you're not going through proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep cycles or you're constantly</v>

2771
02:06:57.331 --> 02:06:59.520
<v Speaker 1>waking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're on your back and you have a</v>

2772
02:06:59.521 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>lot of people have sleep apnea where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll look at their sleep charts and</v>

2773
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:04.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll frequently wake during the night</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>

2774
02:07:04.921 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll see periods where they just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped out of deep sleep.</v>

2775
02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up and you don't have memory</v>

2776
02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:14.460
<v Speaker 1>consolidation or you don't have the type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neuronal repair and recovery that</v>

2777
02:07:14.461 --> 02:07:15.670
<v Speaker 1>you'd want or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2778
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.940
<v Speaker 1>you can even short yourself on muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair,</v>

2779
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:18.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2780
02:07:18.991 --> 02:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a lot that we don't</v>

2781
02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:25.971
<v Speaker 1>know about just dreaming and its ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do things like help form</v>

2782
02:07:26.691 --> 02:07:30.630
<v Speaker 1>memories or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or make learning or experiences more</v>

2783
02:07:30.631 --> 02:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2784
02:07:32.491 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2785
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sleep architecture is something</v>

2786
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:39.640
<v Speaker 1>that just gets super fucked up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern post industrial era.</v>

2787
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>We've got access to pharmaceuticals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a sledgehammer to our heads.</v>

2788
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question about it.</v>

2789
02:07:44.681 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of work done on</v>

2790
02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 1>actually going to sleep with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whole idea of sleep on it.</v>

2791
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually something real to that</v>

2792
02:07:55.691 --> 02:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>that there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some cognitive balancing that's</v>

2793
02:08:00.131 --> 02:08:03.700
<v Speaker 1>going on while you're sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while your mind is actually going over</v>

2794
02:08:03.701 --> 02:08:07.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever issues you might have and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to come up with a problem during</v>

2795
02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:10.720
<v Speaker 1>sleep time during your subconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to know how many times</v>

2796
02:08:10.721 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>now I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm learning this as I get older,</v>

2797
02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:19.410
<v Speaker 1>that you delay a decision or you delay</v>
<v Speaker 1>replying to an email or delay responding</v>

2798
02:08:19.631 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>to a text message or what have you until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten a full night of sleep on</v>

2799
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it and the clarity that you get after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2800
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just basically think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit before you fall asleep and</v>

2801
02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>then he'd go to sleep and you wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with such a better answer.</v>

2802
02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with the lock on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like walk on it is another thing.</v>

2803
02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:37.930
<v Speaker 1>We know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make more nerve growth factor and</v>

2804
02:08:37.931 --> 02:08:41.770
<v Speaker 1>more brain derived neurotrophic factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk while you're learning.</v>

2805
02:08:41.771 --> 02:08:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I recently gave a Tedx talk and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2806
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I made the whole Tedx talk and I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing while I was walking up</v>

2807
02:08:48.871 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 1>on the farm road back behind my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walk them through the forest,</v>

2808
02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>pop out in the sunshine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk up and down that road and just</v>

2809
02:08:55.721 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 1>listened to my ted talk on my earbuds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give my talk and it's just,</v>

2810
02:08:59.711 --> 02:09:01.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing for the brain,</v>

2811
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2812
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Dwelling on something before you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

2813
02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It does the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

2814
02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:10.450
<v Speaker 1>if I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have a response the next day.</v>

2815
02:09:10.451 --> 02:09:12.820
<v Speaker 1>That's kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less emotional,</v>

2816
02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:15.280
<v Speaker 1>more understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendlier,</v>

2817
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 1>reciprocating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2818
02:09:20.261 --> 02:09:21.820
<v Speaker 1>any sort of good vibes.</v>

2819
02:09:21.850 --> 02:09:22.251
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2820
02:09:22.251 --> 02:09:23.980
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2821
02:09:23.981 --> 02:09:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it really interesting how there is some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a wisdom that's imparted on you</v>

2822
02:09:27.581 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 1>while you're sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an,</v>

2823
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and now what I do is I'll think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

2824
02:09:32.291 --> 02:09:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but I am a big fan of fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before he fall asleep.</v>

2825
02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:37.840
<v Speaker 1>He just let you escape to a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>different world.</v>

2826
02:09:37.841 --> 02:09:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I took my kids on this giant tour of New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>

2827
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:43.430
<v Speaker 1>like we went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to Chelsea market and the high</v>

2828
02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:46.750
<v Speaker 1>line park and the empire state building</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ellis Island.</v>

2829
02:09:46.751 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 1>We just did it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we went across the street from</v>

2830
02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Central Park to the New York historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>society where they had a Harry Potter</v>

2831
02:09:55.271 --> 02:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we walked in there.</v>

2832
02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I've just always been resistant to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter phase late and just,</v>

2833
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never read the books and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the movies.</v>

2834
02:10:03.570 --> 02:10:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my kids really wanted to go.</v>

2835
02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So I took him and when I walked through</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and saw all the research,</v>

2836
02:10:09.251 --> 02:10:14.251
<v Speaker 1>the deep research that that j k Rowling</v>
<v Speaker 1>did on Alchemy and herbology and uh,</v>

2837
02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and the history of magic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wizardry in,</v>

2838
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually took a deep dive in all</v>

2839
02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:28.450
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She preplanned out all seven of those</v>

2840
02:10:28.451 --> 02:10:30.730
<v Speaker 1>books before she even wrote the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2841
02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:34.460
<v Speaker 1>And all of her original manuscripts were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and letters back and forth to</v>

2842
02:10:34.461 --> 02:10:38.790
<v Speaker 1>the editor and to the publisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked out the other end of,</v>

2843
02:10:38.850 --> 02:10:40.970
<v Speaker 1>of that exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took us about two hours to get</v>

2844
02:10:40.971 --> 02:10:41.331
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2845
02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>just looking at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbing through everything.</v>

2846
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like a die hard Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter fan.</v>

2847
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Where is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was that.</v>

2848
02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things that was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York historical society.</v>

2849
02:10:53.001 --> 02:10:53.834
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these,</v>

2850
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 1>they'll do an exhibit and they will kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of go in and out during the year.</v>

2851
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>So I doubt it's still going right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause this was like three months ago.</v>

2852
02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2853
02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we walked out and I'm,</v>

2854
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids are like,</v>

2855
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the griffendor wand and this is</v>

2856
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2857
02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:09.310
<v Speaker 1>the slitter or Dumbledore Swan and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>griffendor sweater and the,</v>

2858
02:11:09.311 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the slither and sweater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just started buying them all the</v>

2859
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:15.910
<v Speaker 1>sweaters and the wands and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the book.</v>

2860
02:11:15.911 --> 02:11:18.410
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm halfway through goblet of fire right</v>

2861
02:11:18.411 --> 02:11:21.490
<v Speaker 1>now and I'm actually digging it like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old red all.</v>

2862
02:11:21.491 --> 02:11:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She read a home.</v>

2863
02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the course of a year if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone to the universal ride?</v>

2864
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:28.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a brochure for that down</v>

2865
02:11:28.791 --> 02:11:31.640
<v Speaker 1>at the Hilton where I'm staying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2866
02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:34.640
<v Speaker 1>And the Harry Potter world ride and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

2867
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Reedy Rod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're on a rollercoaster,</v>

2868
02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:39.710

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2869
02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.900
<v Speaker 1>augmented or that'll be next for me.</v>

2871
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:45.860
<v Speaker 1>scream my hands up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll love it.</v>

2872
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good.</v>

2873
02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:49.130
<v Speaker 1>The whole Harry Potter world is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2874
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible] butter beer though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll give you diabetes.</v>

2875
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2876
02:11:53.230 --> 02:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my boys made butter beer first</v>

2877
02:11:55.211 --> 02:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>class classmates because they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2878
02:11:57.710 --> 02:11:59.540
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they helped mom with all this stuff.</v>

2879
02:11:59.541 --> 02:12:02.190
<v Speaker 1>They've got like a cooking podcasts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a,</v>

2880
02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:05.780
<v Speaker 1>their last episode was marshmallows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made marshmallows but there's like</v>

2881
02:12:05.781 --> 02:12:09.410
<v Speaker 1>a cup's worth of bone broth and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow and it's like this healthy</v>

2882
02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:13.880
<v Speaker 1>like glycine and fuse marshmallow that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a dark chocolate fondue with</v>

2883
02:12:14.970 --> 02:12:18.170
<v Speaker 1>coconut flakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much bone broth in a marshmallow.</v>

2884
02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.810
<v Speaker 1>What does it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the recipe but it tastes</v>

2885
02:12:22.050 --> 02:12:25.190
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually not much of a sneaks snacks</v>

<v Speaker 1>into bed kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like taking marshmallows to</v>

2887
02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:29.100
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating marshmallows,</v>

2888
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:30.050
<v Speaker 1>reading Harry Potter.</v>

2889
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:32.990
<v Speaker 1>How much sugar is not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>

2890
02:12:32.991 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2891
02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.360
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a good job with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

2892
02:12:35.361 --> 02:12:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Like they're doing a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black strap,</v>

2893
02:12:38.181 --> 02:12:40.310
<v Speaker 1>molasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevia,</v>

2894
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>raw honey and they're doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2895
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:46.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else did they make?</v>

2896
02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:47.980
<v Speaker 1>They made like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a uh,</v>

2897
02:12:48.330 --> 02:12:53.330
<v Speaker 1>a gluten free baked donut with a cream</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese ginger frosting and counted was</v>

2898
02:12:54.121 --> 02:12:58.780
<v Speaker 1>on top that just like you dip it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee and it tastes like a real donut.</v>

2899
02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Good low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are turning into little little</v>

2900
02:13:01.911 --> 02:13:03.160
<v Speaker 1>chefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make me hungry.</v>

2901
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of grass fed beef</v>

2902
02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:09.380
<v Speaker 1>over regular be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there is a benefit but I don't,</v>

2903
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never can recall correctly.</v>

2904
02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It's something to do with the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>central fatty acid ratios.</v>

2905
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause grain you're going to,</v>

2906
02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have more of the omega</v>
<v Speaker 1>six fatty acids which have been unfairly</v>

2907
02:13:20.841 --> 02:13:23.900
<v Speaker 1>vilified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that a lot of people are just</v>

2908
02:13:23.901 --> 02:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>like don't eat any Omega sixes.</v>

2909
02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Don't have any arachidonic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't,</v>

2910
02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.590
<v Speaker 1>don't overdo your seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nuts,</v>

2911
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:32.520
<v Speaker 1>your nut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like the,</v>

2912
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the orthorexic health world as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like when you read nutrition</v>

2913
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:39.300
<v Speaker 1>magazines and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like do your Omega threes but be</v>

2914
02:13:39.301 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans have a 20 to one omega six to</v>

2915
02:13:43.141 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Omega three ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that a mega six is</v>

2916
02:13:46.201 --> 02:13:50.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of those are derived from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are called parent essential oils.</v>

2917
02:13:50.191 --> 02:13:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And your cell membranes need a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of omega six fatty acids from</v>

2918
02:13:54.241 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>seeds and nuts and plants and even to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain extent,</v>

2919
02:13:58.081 --> 02:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>grains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have an excess of Omega</v>

2920
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:04.440
<v Speaker 1>threes and not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll mega six is because you're going</v>

2921
02:14:04.441 --> 02:14:09.441
<v Speaker 1>so far into the fish oil category than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually damages a component of your,</v>

2922
02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>your mitochondria membrane called Cardio</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lipid.</v>

2923
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You actually make less of that and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with normal sylar activity.</v>

2924
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:19.100
<v Speaker 1>What seeds are most beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2925
02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:21.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2926
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the most nutrient dense</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

2927
02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:27.120
<v Speaker 1>so specific weitzman's Macadamia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2928
02:14:27.121 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 1>what I is like almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>macadamia nuts,</v>

2929
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:32.490
<v Speaker 1>prezoned nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't eat the quasi nuts like</v>

2930
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 1>peanuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

2931
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as high in nutrient density.</v>

2932
02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:39.510
<v Speaker 1>They're more of a legume than a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2933
02:14:39.690 --> 02:14:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my nuts either raw or lightly</v>

2934
02:14:42.031 --> 02:14:43.860
<v Speaker 1>roasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always look at the label and make</v>

2935
02:14:43.861 --> 02:14:48.180
<v Speaker 1>sure they didn't put a lot of vegetable</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and canola oil in them a little.</v>

2936
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2937
02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of nuts in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern [inaudible] my nuts.</v>

2938
02:14:51.181 --> 02:14:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you're nuts if you were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to shell them,</v>

2939
02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:56.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've ever had to shell a</v>

2940
02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:59.130
<v Speaker 1>walnut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to eat 30 walnuts cause</v>

2941
02:14:59.131 --> 02:15:00.320
<v Speaker 1>that'd be exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2942
02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Shell.</v>

2943
02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying as hell but keeps you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating too many of them.</v>

2944
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I buy them shelled and I eat fistfuls of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2945
02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I like a half a bag.</v>

2946
02:15:12.930 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pistachios are great for your</v>

2947
02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>microbiome to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2948
02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I actually had a couple of research</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies on that last year that showed an</v>

2949
02:15:19.651 --> 02:15:24.150
<v Speaker 1>improvement in the diversity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria in your gut with pistachios.</v>

2950
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the nuts as good for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bob,</v>

2951
02:15:25.881 --> 02:15:28.230
<v Speaker 1>probably because of the fiber content in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pistachios,</v>

2952
02:15:28.231 --> 02:15:33.231
<v Speaker 1>but grass fed versus grain fed is</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily the omega three fatty acids</v>

2953
02:15:33.511 --> 02:15:37.290
<v Speaker 1>may have less of the arachidonic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less of the potentially inflammatory</v>

2954
02:15:37.291 --> 02:15:41.190
<v Speaker 1>omega six fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably part of it being that</v>

2955
02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.670
<v Speaker 1>grass fed grass finished beef is</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally raised on a farm that's using</v>

2956
02:15:44.671 --> 02:15:46.590
<v Speaker 1>less herbicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less pesticides,</v>

2957
02:15:46.591 --> 02:15:49.140
<v Speaker 1>raising their meat and a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable fashion.</v>

2958
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving it less hormones,</v>

2959
02:15:50.911 --> 02:15:53.280
<v Speaker 1>getting less antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's painting with a broad brush.</v>

2960
02:15:53.281 --> 02:15:56.670
<v Speaker 1>But generally grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to it than just the fatty</v>

2961
02:15:56.671 --> 02:15:57.750
<v Speaker 1>acid composition.</v>

2962
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just a better meat overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my,</v>

2963
02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>well better health wise grain fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not lie like you can,</v>

2964
02:16:05.881 --> 02:16:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you can have a pretty damn tasty fatty</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut of grain fed beef.</v>

2965
02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I certainly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I honestly prefer the taste of grass</v>

2966
02:16:13.141 --> 02:16:15.240
<v Speaker 1>fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the dense or meet the darker</v>

2967
02:16:15.241 --> 02:16:16.800
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it better.</v>

2968
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it just,</v>

2969
02:16:18.210 --> 02:16:19.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just tastes healthier.</v>

2970
02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I crave it more,</v>

2971
02:16:21.570 --> 02:16:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I go back and forth between the</v>

2972
02:16:23.281 --> 02:16:25.520
<v Speaker 1>two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I eat grain fed,</v>

2973
02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it feels like like a lazy cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's mushy and Scott like it's</v>

2974
02:16:30.251 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious.</v>

2975
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a difference.</v>

2976
02:16:33.250 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny cause I've gone over</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Dubai a few times and tall light</v>

2977
02:16:37.091 --> 02:16:42.091
<v Speaker 1>fitness conferences over there and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise grain fed like they want</v>

2978
02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:44.680
<v Speaker 1>everybody to like when you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of it was like this beef is the</v>

2979
02:16:44.681 --> 02:16:49.681
<v Speaker 1>finest grain fed beef fat on a grain</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty widely recognized as the greatest</v>

2980
02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:52.480
<v Speaker 1>steakhouse in the world.</v>

2981
02:16:52.570 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 1>That place is all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That trip,</v>

2982
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like my steak at how fucking</v>

2983
02:16:58.121 --> 02:17:00.040
<v Speaker 1>dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm gonna get,</v>

2984
02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rude Brooklyn waiter's going to</v>

2985
02:17:03.431 --> 02:17:04.670
<v Speaker 1>take me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2986
02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just something about like,</v>

2987
02:17:09.250 --> 02:17:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the meat just tastes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tasted like it was drenched in</v>

2988
02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:14.530
<v Speaker 1>vegetable oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something about it just didn't</v>

2989
02:17:14.531 --> 02:17:18.190
<v Speaker 1>taste right and maybe I had a poor Peter</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luger's experience that doesn't even</v>

2990
02:17:18.191 --> 02:17:20.320
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not enjoy it that much.</v>

2991
02:17:20.321 --> 02:17:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate there and afterwards I'm like,</v>

2992
02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2993
02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think food gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:17:26.410 --> 02:17:28.570
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or New York does have a lot of good</v>

2995
02:17:28.571 --> 02:17:29.980
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so y'all,</v>

2996
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy David Bouley,</v>

2997
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>he's a chef over there and he has this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful restaurant where he brings</v>

2998
02:17:35.651 --> 02:17:40.240
<v Speaker 1>like doctors and nutritionists in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they teach you about certain aspects of</v>

2999
02:17:40.241 --> 02:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>the food that you're eating.</v>

3000
02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I did one there on longevity and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught about like having bitters before</v>

3001
02:17:45.041 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 1>your meal to reduce your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your glucose and your insulin response</v>

3002
02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:53.560
<v Speaker 1>to the meal and the use of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sweet breads for your thymus gland</v>

3003
02:17:53.561 --> 02:17:58.270
<v Speaker 1>to increase the activity of your immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to uh,</v>

3004
02:17:58.271 --> 02:18:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of these polyphenols and</v>

3005
02:18:00.131 --> 02:18:04.050
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants from the purples and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greens and the blues to uh,</v>

3006
02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:07.390
<v Speaker 1>there were these things called</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncoupling proteins that actually get</v>

3007
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:10.090
<v Speaker 1>activated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cryotherapy and cold water</v>

3008
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:13.300
<v Speaker 1>immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also are something that get</v>

3009
02:18:13.301 --> 02:18:16.330
<v Speaker 1>activated with the consumption of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3010
02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:20.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like a sea urchin is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a sea urchin foam that they</v>

3011
02:18:20.171 --> 02:18:23.140
<v Speaker 1>did at this dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what he does is he'll</v>

3012
02:18:23.141 --> 02:18:25.720
<v Speaker 1>partner with the physician or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the nutritionist or whatever.</v>

3013
02:18:25.721 --> 02:18:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I make this amazing like four hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3014
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 1>five star meal that's designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance the health effects and whatever</v>

3015
02:18:33.581 --> 02:18:35.020
<v Speaker 1>it is that you just learned about.</v>

3016
02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:38.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was actually in New York when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that blood procedure a couple of</v>

3017
02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:38.730
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3018
02:18:38.730 --> 02:18:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I dropped in there again and eight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when my favorite places to go to</v>

3019
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:45.340
<v Speaker 1>a steakhouse in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that guy who fucking sprinkles of</v>

3020
02:18:45.341 --> 02:18:47.320
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell's his name?</v>

3021
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Salt Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a place in New York.</v>

3022
02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So you know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know know that that fucking,</v>

3023
02:18:52.601 --> 02:18:54.210
<v Speaker 1>that meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3024
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 1>The guy's got the saw off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it on the meat.</v>

3025
02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too busy doing actual work.</v>

3026
02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:00.400
<v Speaker 1>But I like salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3027
02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I like good salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

3028
02:19:02.651 --> 02:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you know what the very best salt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get as what this is based on.</v>

3029
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I was with a group of doctors a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of months ago in park city and this guy,</v>

3030
02:19:09.431 --> 02:19:12.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys who was there was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and assault expert and he did</v>

3031
02:19:12.761 --> 02:19:16.810
<v Speaker 1>what's called a mass spectrometry</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of all these popular salt like</v>

3032
02:19:16.811 --> 02:19:21.811
<v Speaker 1>Himalayan Sea salt and Black Kona salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as tech salt and Mexican salt and</v>

3033
02:19:22.841 --> 02:19:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you know all these different salts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze them for their,</v>

3034
02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:30.080
<v Speaker 1>their mineral content because you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>high mineral content but their metal</v>

3035
02:19:30.081 --> 02:19:30.950
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3036
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Like we know that iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in guys now we're finding out</v>

3037
02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:35.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3038
02:19:35.361 --> 02:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it's oxidated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can cause damage associated with</v>

3039
02:19:38.001 --> 02:19:40.700
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that metals and and</v>

3040
02:19:40.701 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>microplastics and all these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are winding up in the food</v>

3041
02:19:43.281 --> 02:19:46.070
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The top of the list in terms of</v>

3042
02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:49.010
<v Speaker 1>cleanliness and it's Celtic salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helped it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know blue bag.</v>

3044
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a grey salt and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray because they don't like bleach it,</v>

3045
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's still clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like pink and reddish cause it</v>

3046
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a lot of irons.</v>

02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:17.600
<v Speaker 1>According less dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

3056
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:20.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always travel with some kind of salt.</v>

3057
02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.720
<v Speaker 1>My wife gets pissed because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3058
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 1>she'll make these amazing meals and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing I do is I just pull out the</v>

3059
02:20:25.641 --> 02:20:30.170
<v Speaker 1>salt does cover everything in Salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's because I excrete a lot</v>

3060
02:20:30.171 --> 02:20:33.300
<v Speaker 1>of salt when I raced for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3061
02:20:33.301 --> 02:20:35.570
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for timex actually they brought in a</v>

3062
02:20:35.571 --> 02:20:39.740
<v Speaker 1>bunch of physiologists to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to test our sweat sodium or sweat sodium</v>

3063
02:20:39.741 --> 02:20:41.090
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they,</v>

3064
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:46.450
<v Speaker 1>they measure how much sodium you excrete</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any given volume of sweat and this</v>

3065
02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:48.710
<v Speaker 1>kind of returns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole genetic thing.</v>

3066
02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at people of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern European ancestry who would</v>

3067
02:20:52.991 --> 02:20:55.820
<v Speaker 1>have come from a population that did a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of fermenting,</v>

3068
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of curing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pickling,</v>

3069
02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:03.080
<v Speaker 1>we would develop some pretty robust</v>
<v Speaker 1>sodium excretion mechanisms,</v>

3070
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:03.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3071
02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're preserving our food with salt.</v>

3072
02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't want all that salt to build up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body because theoretically you</v>

3073
02:21:10.071 --> 02:21:12.830
<v Speaker 1>could increase blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could cause some damage if you have</v>

3074
02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:15.660
<v Speaker 1>too much salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at other folks who</v>

3075
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:16.340
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3076
02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:20.330
<v Speaker 1>people who would for example sweat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and live in a hot environment,</v>

3077
02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever South Africa are very hot</v>

3078
02:21:23.361 --> 02:21:27.980
<v Speaker 1>region of the Philippines or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have some pretty robust salt</v>

3079
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:32.480
<v Speaker 1>conservation mechanisms to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on to sodium and hold on to salt</v>

3080
02:21:32.481 --> 02:21:36.470
<v Speaker 1>because you're sweating more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While my sweat sodium analysis revealed</v>

3081
02:21:36.471 --> 02:21:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that I lose like two and a half times</v>
<v Speaker 1>more salt in my sweat than the average</v>

3082
02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:43.190
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that dictates to a certain</v>

3083
02:21:43.191 --> 02:21:48.191
<v Speaker 1>extent my almost my craving for salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was racing ironman triathlon,</v>

3084
02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I would lay awake at night and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel my blood pounding in my ears after</v>

3085
02:21:53.391 --> 02:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>a day of training.</v>

3086
02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And I started using salt heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the first things that</v>

3087
02:21:57.951 --> 02:22:00.560
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because salt regulates aldosterone,</v>

3088
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:03.920
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulates your blood pressure.</v>

3089
02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:07.310
<v Speaker 1>All of that went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could fall asleep at night.</v>

3090
02:22:07.311 --> 02:22:08.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you lay your head down on your</v>

3091
02:22:08.571 --> 02:22:11.450
<v Speaker 1>pillow and I couldn't hear the blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding in my ears.</v>

3092
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:13.430
<v Speaker 1>So for about four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>

3093
02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been salt on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a ton of it.</v>

3094
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to wrap this up,</v>

3095
02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:19.880
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome though.</v>

3096
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Speaker 1>You're the best dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>

3097
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It's always good to talk to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck you retain all</v>

3098
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad</v>

3099
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:27.360
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

3100
02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My pleasure.</v>

3101
02:22:28.711 --> 02:22:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give everybody your instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stub.</v>

3102
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Google Ben Greenfield on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

3103
02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you brother.</v>

3104
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:36.061
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks,</v>

3105
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 3>ma'am.</v>
