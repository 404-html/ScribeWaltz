00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 2>That's why my whole thing grow your own shit.</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:06.661
<v Speaker 2>and not,</v>

5
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:07.291
<v Speaker 2>you don't have an end.</v>

6
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

7
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to grow everything yourself.</v>

8
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

9
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it collectively with your neighbors,</v>

10
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

11
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like where you growing the apples and the,</v>

12
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.140
<v Speaker 2>and the carrots and Sally down the street is going some chart and rhubarb or</v>

13
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:20.974
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell.</v>

14
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 2>So now you can trade food and I can send my son to Yo spot until Yo give me some</v>

15
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 2>carrots do from Joe's house and that's,</v>

16
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and vice versa.</v>

17
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:29.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

18
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you can send them over to my house and get some onions.</v>

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what I see,</v>

20
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

21
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.771
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

22
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:34.471
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>

23
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have eliminated a couple of systems there and you've created community,</v>

24
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you created partnerships,</v>

25
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 2>you create a business without,</v>

26
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 2>without the money exchange and to,</v>

27
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 2>and you've created safety,</v>

28
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

30
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

31
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 2>and it's so damn simple to me and I guess it's going take me while it's so</v>

32
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 2>simple that it's like,</v>

33
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>but you guys know this,</v>

34
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.054
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.991
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

36
00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.003
<v Speaker 1>That's what's cool.</v>

38
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about something that's like,</v>

39
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>just been discovered,</v>

40
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>some new technology that has recently been released to the public.</v>

41
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

42
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.841
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

43
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.201
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

44
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.034
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

45
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 2>that's why as to me,</v>

46
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

47
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it's still somewhat mind boggling.</v>

48
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

49
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% mind boggling.</v>

50
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And what you said about community as giant because I think people live in this</v>

51
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>weird place now where we barely even know our neighbors.</v>

52
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

53
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And the more populated the areas are,</v>

54
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you are to know your name.</v>

55
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.711
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

56
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 2>That's where the safety comes in.</v>

57
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know,</v>

58
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I know your son and I know he shouldn't be doing that and I know he should wait.</v>

59
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Yo Dude.</v>

60
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 2>So I know,</v>

61
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 2>so that's what,</v>

63
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 2>that's where the safety comes in.</v>

64
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.471
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

65
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's where,</v>

66
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 2>that's where the neighbor hood and that's where community comes in and that's</v>

67
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 2>what caring for one another comes in.</v>

68
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

69
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

70
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

71
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.761
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

72
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

73
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

74
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 2>we can do it,</v>

75
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.851
<v Speaker 2>it can happen.</v>

76
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

77
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 2>there's too many,</v>

78
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 2>there's too many examples of this happening.</v>

79
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

80
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this on stage.</v>

81
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that once they develop artificial men,</v>

82
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>like artificial human beings,</v>

83
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>like blade runner style,</v>

84
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.383
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come.</v>

85
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be women that have sex robots in their house and we're going to</v>

86
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>find out what women really like when,</v>

87
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:08.611
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

88
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.611
<v Speaker 1>when you can actually buy a person that is an artificial person that was created</v>

89
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>entirely in a lab and you could manufacture their personality and get it to</v>

90
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly where you want it to be and have them do anything you want them to do.</v>

91
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially robot sex slaves.</v>

92
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go over your grandma's house and she's going to have five,</v>

93
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>seven foot tall Zulu warriors had just throw decoder all day.</v>

94
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the reality.</v>

95
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.921
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's going to be.</v>

96
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go over your mom's house and everyone is going to look like</v>

97
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime and they're all going to be walking around</v>

98
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>with like Whitey tighties on a giant hogs at black Arnold.</v>

99
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

100
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she likes them all mixed up.</v>

101
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she likes Arnold.</v>

102
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll,</v>

103
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>it'll be Arnold.</v>

104
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll going to be able to recreate celebrities.</v>

105
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

106
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence is not just going to be on the cloud.</v>

107
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have her in your fucking dungeon.</v>

108
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have her locked up.</v>

109
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be real.</v>

110
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.541
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

111
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not that difficult to do.</v>

112
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>If they can make a three d representation of her right now,</v>

113
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty accurate.</v>

114
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean the graphics that they can do right now in video games are fucking</v>

115
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>credible and the CGI that can do is incredible.</v>

116
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you've seen that robot Japanese face where it's getting pretty creepy.</v>

117
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It's getting pretty creepy.</v>

118
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>They're getting really close to human beings.</v>

119
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Well you went from uh,</v>

120
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>having the Porsche Rs,</v>

121
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>the 4.0</v>

122
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.353
<v Speaker 3>and then you went,</v>

123
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.231
<v Speaker 3>did you get a five,</v>

124
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:34.441
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

125
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:35.270
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

126
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.640
<v Speaker 3>$5?</v>

127
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's not goes down in history,</v>

128
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it as possibly the worst financial move ever.</v>

129
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe you did that.</v>

130
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:41.670
<v Speaker 3>First of all.</v>

131
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.151
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

132
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 3>get rid of like one of the greatest Porsche's ever.</v>

133
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.320
<v Speaker 3>We agreed we weren't going to talk about that.</v>

134
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just not fair.</v>

135
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.031
<v Speaker 3>It's just not fair.</v>

136
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:48.990
<v Speaker 3>You can't remind me of that.</v>

137
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:49.760
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying,</v>

138
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like me saying you had a,</v>

139
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:51.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

140
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 3>you'll go from was Heidi Klum or something,</v>

141
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

142
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I think they remind me of that.</v>

143
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 3>You got rid of one of the greatest cars ever that's worth so much money now.</v>

144
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing,</v>

145
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

146
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 3>How much are they worth now?</v>

147
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I saw one for sale for 275,000 American.</v>

148
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

149
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that with much more than that.</v>

150
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:07.771
<v Speaker 3>And the UK,</v>

152
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 3>they're worth well over $350,000.</v>

153
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

154
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.091
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

155
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 3>so I did a right out of mine.</v>

156
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.041
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

157
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:14.241
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

158
00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

159
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I take a very philosophical view about this stuff.</v>

160
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 3>I got to own a fully TRS.</v>

161
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 3>I did things with it that not many people that own $40 is,</v>

162
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.351
<v Speaker 3>I've done,</v>

163
00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I did big journeys.</v>

164
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I used it a lot.</v>

165
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of it stood up on youtube of it being driven in a completely</v>

166
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:28.704
<v Speaker 3>ludicrous manner.</v>

167
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.783
<v Speaker 3>That was my car.</v>

168
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

169
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 3>it made me money.</v>

170
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

171
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.290
<v Speaker 3>that was a pretty nice thing to happen.</v>

172
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 3>And at the time I didn't have any money.</v>

173
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

174
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I bet the House on that thing,</v>

175
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 3>I used the last bit of cash,</v>

176
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I had to put the deposit down.</v>

177
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't meet the financial criteria from Porsche,</v>

178
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 3>so I had to beg,</v>

179
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.230
<v Speaker 3>steal and borrow to get them to lend me the money.</v>

180
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And then the payments were well over £1,000 a month and I wasn't earning much</v>

181
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:51.534
<v Speaker 3>money at the time,</v>

182
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 3>so I couldn't really afford it.</v>

183
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I sort of kept going for,</v>

184
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I think we had it for a year and a bit,</v>

185
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.720
<v Speaker 3>and then I just had the set age.</v>

186
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 3>It was just basic economics.</v>

187
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't afford the finance.</v>

188
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 3>But then after that,</v>

189
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.240
<v Speaker 3>about six months after that,</v>

190
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I started earning a bit more money.</v>

191
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple of contracts that were quite good.</v>

192
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.591
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit of money.</v>

193
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 3>And of course the medical condition means the moment you've got money,</v>

194
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 3>you go straight out and buy a car,</v>

195
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

196
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need a five,</v>

197
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:13.171
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

198
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>

199
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 3>It was absolute nonsense.</v>

200
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 3>It costs me a fortune.</v>

201
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 3>I lost a load of money.</v>

202
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably lost half the money I'd made on the port in it,</v>

203
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 3>but I'd always wanted a five nine nine I,</v>

204
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

205
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I view life as a series of boxes to tick.</v>

206
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

207
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's quite binary.</v>

208
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just a series of ones and noughts and that's what I want to do.</v>

209
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.190
<v Speaker 3>And the 42 box had been ticked.</v>

210
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

211
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

212
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.573
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

213
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't really derive any pleasure from sitting and telling a room full of</v>

214
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 3>people that I've got a 42 IRS.</v>

215
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>

216
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I derive pleasure from driving it.</v>

217
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.050
<v Speaker 3>But once I had driven it quite a bit,</v>

218
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I can't kind of done it,</v>

219
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.170
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

221
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky in that I can kind of use them to the,</v>

222
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 3>to the full extent of their abilities.</v>

223
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 3>That's a nice thing to know that you can do that.</v>

224
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 3>You've driven a 42 rest to 100 of his ability as a nice thing to know.</v>

225
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.593
<v Speaker 3>And I'd done that.</v>

226
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought I quite like a five,</v>

227
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.341
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

228
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 3>nine and the nine had the five nine,</v>

229
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 3>nine for a year and realized that it was actually just too big.</v>

230
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 3>And too fast for UK rose,</v>

231
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>but I tick that box and then the next box to tick was probably a five 12 tr or</v>

232
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.814
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

233
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 3>or m three or there's just so much out there.</v>

234
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit like walking into a bookshop.</v>

235
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 3>You need to know where to start.</v>

236
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 3>D and I love that about the subjects I've got caught endlessly fascinating and</v>

237
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 3>looking for the next thing that I want to enjoy it.</v>

238
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

239
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>it is amazing.</v>

240
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think that when the f the football players have all demonstrated this</v>

241
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>consistent pattern of brain trauma,</v>

242
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>if they kissed each other all the time and they're trying to figure out how to</v>

244
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:37.641
<v Speaker 1>mitigate that,</v>

245
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>but along the way,</v>

246
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>the data becomes undeniable.</v>

247
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>So now they're at that same spot where they're like,</v>

248
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>the tobacco companies were okay,</v>

249
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes cause cancer,</v>

250
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but we still want it to be legal,</v>

251
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.611
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

252
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:46.851
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

253
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:47.181
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

254
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Football causes brain damage,</v>

255
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but we still want to play it.</v>

256
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys still want to play football?</v>

257
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to make money?</v>

258
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Make money,</v>

259
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

260
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>You're worried about getting hit and had a couple of times,</v>

261
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.401
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

262
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do my best to not hit heads together,</v>

263
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>but we're playing fucking football because when man,</v>

264
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.541
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

265
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens and dudes will fucking march out there,</v>

266
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:06.374
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

267
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking keep banging heads.</v>

268
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll still bang heads.</v>

269
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking bang heads and get penalized for animals.</v>

270
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:13.574
<v Speaker 1>We're savages.</v>

271
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Especially like when you are just a complete stud athlete and you're involved in</v>

272
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:24.690
<v Speaker 1>this ultra competitive world of trying to dominate other stud athletes and spike</v>

273
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>balls in their face and they're just fucking out there.</v>

274
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.603
<v Speaker 1>They're going to play.</v>

275
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I got gotta admit,</v>

276
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I just visualize this super stud athletes spiking the ball and I got a little</v>

277
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>turned off so I can understand why they do it.</v>

278
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I can understand you.</v>

279
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that's you when you see what,</v>

280
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch as much football,</v>

281
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but I love highlight reels.</v>

282
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I love watching ESPN because they'll show like the best shit.</v>

283
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to.</v>

284
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the downs.</v>

285
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:51.711
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

286
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the rules.</v>

287
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the rules of football.</v>

288
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Neither do I.</v>

289
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>So we're on the same boat twos.</v>

290
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>You're calling flags.</v>

291
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:56.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

292
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>what is all this rest?</v>

293
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Why is everybody resting?</v>

294
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>There should be just constant chaos.</v>

295
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I would want to see it like an MMA bow.</v>

296
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking five guys on this side.</v>

297
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Five guys on that side moved the ball,</v>

298
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>go chaos,</v>

299
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:09.824
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>

300
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>No breaks.</v>

301
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>When you get it across,</v>

302
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you fucking march it back the other way and do it that way.</v>

303
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And no breaks,</v>

304
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>no breaks,</v>

305
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>no this whistle blowing.</v>

306
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And that white guy off the fucking field,</v>

307
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>that little tiny white guy with the white outfit,</v>

308
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get killed.</v>

309
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to accidentally run over that fucker and he's going to die.</v>

310
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>This 300 pound men on who knows God,</v>

311
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 1>what kind of concoctions that are made in laboratories that have allowed them to</v>

312
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>grow so big.</v>

313
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:36.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
