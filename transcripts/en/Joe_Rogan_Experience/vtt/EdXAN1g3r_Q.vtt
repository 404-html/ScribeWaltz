00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.823

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>let me paint this with my tone postcards.</v>

22
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.463
<v Speaker 1>Dark,</v>

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

24
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So I used to work in retail and the story,</v>

25
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

26
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:49.404
<v Speaker 1>let's call it</v>

27
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.613
<v Speaker 1>rad spread.</v>

28
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>That's actually really loud.</v>

29
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.383
<v Speaker 1>Sorry</v>

30
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.323
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

31
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>So I was working in retail and it was a horrible job.</v>

32
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>It was like totally degrading as a human and all you would do is fold clothes</v>

33
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>all day and it was really expensive and these people would come in and spend</v>

34
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous amounts of money on clothes and they were just shitty and mean and</v>

35
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>rude and rich,</v>

36
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

37
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Not that that all constitutes,</v>

38
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but it was just an unpleasant experience.</v>

39
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And from whether it was a customer or the staff that,</v>

40
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>my employers were just not kind and they didn't give a shit about you.</v>

42
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>So I was already,</v>

43
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was kind of walking on thin ice because I wasn't like enthusiastic</v>

44
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.031
<v Speaker 1>about being there.</v>

45
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.864
<v Speaker 1>It was just a job.</v>

46
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

47
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>one day before the biggest sale of the year where people like late ladies freak</v>

48
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:44.904
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

49
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I came into the store and that weekend there had been like,</v>

50
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>there had been indications and evidence that there were rodents because,</v>

51
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

52
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

53
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I knew it were,</v>

54
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it were rats cause I could smell them.</v>

55
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.011
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>

56
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

57
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I could smell it.</v>

58
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Literally when someone says I can smell a rat,</v>

59
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a musty smell to them.</v>

60
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking smell them.</v>

61
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

62
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>it's totally,</v>

63
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>cause my first house in La,</v>

64
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I moved into off of a Craig's list ad had rats and I knew I,</v>

65
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like that smell light.</v>

66
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I know that smell.</v>

67
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>That was from my old house.</v>

68
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.134
<v Speaker 1>That's a rat.</v>

69
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So long story short,</v>

70
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the exterminators come in and set traps the night before.</v>

71
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So Saturday morning when like this big sale starts,</v>

72
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.221
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

73
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:23.881
<v Speaker 1>all the girls were like,</v>

74
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

75
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they call it something?</v>

76
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:26.334
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

77
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>We walk into the store and there's like,</v>

78
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>there's one dead rat upstairs,</v>

79
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>there's one in the traps downstairs,</v>

80
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>another one downstairs.</v>

81
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another,</v>

82
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a trap that had been deployed and there was a piece of a big large</v>

83
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>piece of a tail and blood.</v>

84
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking blood all over the clothes,</v>

85
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>all over the wall,</v>

86
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.943
<v Speaker 1>but no rat.</v>

87
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And one of the girls had walked into the front of the,</v>

88
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>of the store and also you should know there was a line forming outside of people</v>

89
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that wanted to get in to get this end of the year sale.</v>

90
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>One of the girls walks in,</v>

91
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

92
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.253
<v Speaker 1>oh with that,</v>

93
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and it was the size of a cat and it was the rat that got that got out of the</v>

94
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>trap that like lost its tail was in the middle of the store bleeding and it was</v>

95
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>like this big,</v>

96
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>everybody's freaking out.</v>

97
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the girls was ballsy enough to throw a trash can over it.</v>

98
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.974
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

99
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like screaming in this.</v>

101
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And so at this point and this point,</v>

102
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it's time.</v>

103
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It is time to,</v>

104
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>to open the store and all that.</v>

105
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Like people are knocking on the window and we were able to,</v>

106
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

107
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>we were able to sort of create a diversion and put some clothes racks so you</v>

108
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>couldn't see the trashcan</v>

109
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>on the window.</v>

110
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was letting them know what I mean?</v>

111
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:44.231
<v Speaker 1>This was like a,</v>

112
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>it was screaming like you couldn't no one [inaudible] so we called the</v>

113
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.264
<v Speaker 1>exterminator.</v>

114
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh it gets so much better.</v>

115
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>The exterminator comes back.</v>

116
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:53.290

119
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't open the doors.</v>

120
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.431
<v Speaker 1>We have a sale.</v>

121
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a line around the block,</v>

122
00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:58.600

125
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>everybody's freaking out,</v>

126
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>exterminator shows up.</v>

127
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And he walks in,</v>

128
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:06.791
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

129
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.181

<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

132
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:08.621
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

133
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know my pellet gun.</v>

134
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

135
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.641
<v Speaker 1>and the next thing I know,</v>

136
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>he walks out to his truck and he comes back with a two by four and he's like,</v>

137
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you ladies might want to step back,</v>

138
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>kicks the trashcan open and just fucking splat.</v>

139
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.303
<v Speaker 1>Like he was</v>

140
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>watching him,</v>

141
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>watching him fucking blow up of watermelon in the middle of the store.</v>

142
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

143
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

144
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.623
<v Speaker 1>it gets so much better.</v>

145
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>So after he kills the rat and it's like guts and end trails are all over the</v>

146
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.280

<v Speaker 1>we've been wanting to talk to you about,</v>

176
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

179
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel,</v>

180
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I know that you want to be a musician,</v>

181
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:20.831
<v Speaker 1>just want to be,</v>

182
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

183
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.113
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

184
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.143
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

185
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.103
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

186
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't fire me before he made me clean up the rats blood.</v>

187
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I had to clean up the blood and then get fired.</v>

188
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

189
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it was one of those moments where I literally,</v>

190
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I lost my shit and then she was like,</v>

191
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:37.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

192
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you can stay for the rest of the day if you want.</v>

193
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

194
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you think I want to stay here and look at you.</v>

195
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I hate you.</v>

196
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.164
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

198
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>But it's such a good story.</v>

199
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>So going through it was all worth it at the time.</v>

200
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.891
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

202
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.724
<v Speaker 1>I'd never,</v>

203
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I had never experienced like any,</v>

204
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fantastical story.</v>

205
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic story.</v>

206
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.933
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

207
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny how a story that is absolutely horrible at the time becomes</v>

208
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.333
<v Speaker 1>awesome?</v>

209
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

210
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It was really good in the past.</v>

211
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>It was a low point though,</v>

212
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>cause it was so insane.</v>

213
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone in like dig,</v>

214
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>like just degrades you like that.</v>

215
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Like she said,</v>

216
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I know you're trying to be a musician,</v>

217
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but like your heart's on in it.</v>

218
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.311
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

219
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>of course I don't want to go out and sell it again.</v>

220
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to cleaning up.</v>

222
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

223
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.734
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

224
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.830
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

225
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I just don't get rats or two by fours.</v>

226
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>You need to examine your priorities.</v>
