WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.840
Oh fuck yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Oh fuck.
Yeah,

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.220
so we're doing this place on the 22nd and the 23rd we're working together two

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:11.730
nights in a row.
Bryan County.
That's what's happening.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:15.900
key believed this.
I get to work with one of my best friends on the planet earth,

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:17.580
Brian motherfucking calendar,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.100
September 22nd and 23rd 22nd will be at the Ice House.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.370
I hate saying one of my best friends because I don't want to be mean to my other

8
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.710
best is how it is.
I'm kind of you

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.730
guys at the end of the day.
At the end of the day,

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.080
how do I fit in your fucking program?

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280
My number three cock saga now I'm very easy to hang out with for you that it's

12
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:45.060
just,
it's no,
we're both retarded.
Yeah.
We speak each other's language.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.810
That's the best part of it.
Yeah.
We understand the 23rd you guys,
Hong Kong,

14
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.490
Ventura and Ventura,
California.
Yeah.
We're doing two shows now.

15
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.330
We just added an eight o'clock to 10 it's not,
it's not for sale yet,

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
but it will be for sale soon and then eight o'clock and at 10 o'clock show and

17
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:06.120
Tuesday we're doing something.
Um,
that's like a showcase at the ice house.

18
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.100
Just me and Callen on Tuesday night,

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
the 22nd 22nd on the 23rd the 22nd ice has 23rd Hong Kong in two shows eight and

20
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:18.840
10 if we just had a hunting trip in with that,
ah,
it might be the perfect week.

21
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
Ah,
we need to go hunting again.
Yeah.
It's not even about the animals,

22
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.990
it's just an,

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.990
it's an opportunity for me to be a silly goose and have you captive five days.

24
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.980
Well,
one of our favorite trips was the one in Alaska,

25
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:36.090
which was the most miserable Rinella had a really fucking good point about that

26
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:39.240
trip.
He and he was talking about things that are fun.
He's like,

27
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.020
there's things that are fun while you're doing them and then they're not fun

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.123
afterwards,

29
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.070
but there's things that are not fun while you're doing them and they become

30
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.460
really fun after you've done it.
Such an interesting point.
Yeah.

31
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:55.050
It's one of his buddies has this scale of fun.
It's like,

32
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.290
and the cheapest easiest fund is like roller coaster rides,

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.930
but nobody looks back on a roller coaster where he goes,
man,

34
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.380
at the time it went down fucking rollercoaster,
man.
Yay.

35
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.210
We did that real look dude.
We went up,

36
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.450
we went down with all those other people strapped to our seat.
No,
no,
no.
You need,

37
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.100
you need an element of suffering.

38
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.440
You need to be shivering in the morning and wet.

39
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.720
And I think because they've done some studies on what happens when you're in

40
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:22.860
those situations,
you create anxiety actually creates oxytocin.

41
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.240
And oxytocin is a bonding chemical.
So when you're going through the shit,

42
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.580
when it's raining and you're cold and you're like,
fuck man,

43
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.170
this is going to sock.
We gotta go find a deer.

44
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.750
It's actually a bonding experience.

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.310
And what happens is when you think back on it,
like what,

46
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:39.030
what are you going to do when you're sitting there freezing in the rain?

47
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.940
You're going to make each other laugh.
It was just silliness.
You know?

48
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.760
What else are you gonna do?
And I think what with you and not,
yeah,

49
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.890
but you and I have a good attitude for that stuff.

50
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.950
We can both just accept the fact that we're in a bad environment.

51
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.160
There's some people that just can't accept it and they freak out.
Yeah,

52
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.870
those are the ones you can't bring it with you.

53
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.800
I can't bring those people with me,
but even those people,
I always submit that.

54
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.490
A lot of that is like how you've always approached bad situations.

55
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.660
Like how have you have you learned?
Well I would say it's also a factor,

56
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.440
a fact that they are thinking about the wrong things,

57
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.940
so they always say mental strength is more about what you choose not to think

58
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.560
about and shitty circumstances.

59
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.190
Like Tim Kennedy was telling a really funny story about when he was doing a

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.620
ranger because I asked him,
I said,
what drives you?
Like how do you,

61
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.680
how are you so tough?
What do you think it is?
They said,
I dunno man.
He said,

62
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.740
I was ranger training and the,
and it was so cold.

63
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:32.670
I was laying on the ground and we're winning for us,
simulate an ambush and I,

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.640
my my,
my Dick was hitting the like a woodpecker.
I was shivering.

65
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.900
My body was shivering like,

66
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.030
like that and some do just got up and went down the road and said,
I quit.

67
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.350
I give up,
I'm done.
And Tim is sitting there freezing and he goes,

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.710
that dude is so fucking smart.

69
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.940
He's so much smarter than I am.
Here I am in the shit.

70
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:59.260
And that guy is smart enough to be like,
fuck it,
I don't want to do this anymore.

71
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020
And he was just,
he just says,
I was just too stubborn to quit.

72
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.290
Now I'm more impressed at Tim then I am with that depends on what the guy did.

73
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:12.421
If you left and started some global powerhouse of a company like Tesla motors or

74
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:17.010
something like that and went on to make $1 billion in the next two years,

75
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.580
I would say,
yeah,
that guy probably did the right thing.

76
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.630
That's why it's really important for our society to be structured in such a way

77
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.200
that you allow people to do what they're meant to do.
If you're in Russia,

78
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.390
the guy with the biggest guns and the biggest muscles,

79
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.890
that's the guy that runs everything.

80
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.680
But how much innovation comes out of Russia was the last time you bought a

81
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:36.550
Russian computer,
a Russian car or Russian,
anything.
It's a very good point.
Yeah,

82
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.650
good fighters.
They make good fighters and they're very tight hose,

83
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.280
very macho culture,
like aggressive men.
The hose,
a fantastic point.

84
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.240
They are on point.

85
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.560
And I was 17 and I had my experience with two of them in the Cosmos Hotel,

86
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.730
hopefully in Russia.
I sure did.
17 spent Lana and Christine at the money.

87
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.740
Uh Oh.
I didn't give them money,

88
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.120
but I did give him my Nike shoes and my blue jeans and my blue jeans because

89
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:05.050
there was a guy there.
So this is before we sorted out the Cold War,

90
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.570
1985 so it was still danger.

91
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.060
I was 1817 you barely could get over there,
right?

92
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.640
I mean you can get over there with,
they looked at you funny.

93
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.780
You got to government monitor.
Um,
the government monitoring.

94
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.740
They would bug your hotel room to make sure you weren't,
you know,
Kate,
uh,

95
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.560
at CIA or whatever.
So to just walk around in your hotel room and go,

96
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.220
Oh fuck yeah,
I'm calming,
cooling,

97
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.920
communism,
communist turns cod.

98
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.980
We fully look at trends all the time.
Gum,
look,
I'm going to come look,
he's come,

99
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:39.910
he had his gum there.
He'd come bathroom,
he'd come Boucle knee,

100
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.570
come television on bid,
we'll clean.
Not me is young.

101
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.520
He's 17.
His Dick never go down.
Oh,
was don't Mike Swick told me,

102
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.650
Mike Swick,
uh,
used to work for some government agency.
I forget what it was,

103
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.280
but I want to say secret service.
Um,
but they were in Moscow.

104
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.220
They discovered these listening devices that the Russians had placed in their

105
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:06.221
buildings and they were so sophisticated that they were powered by the movement

106
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.190
of the building.
Cause every move,
every building has subtle movement.

107
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.490
Like if you've ever been in a building that is in an earthquake,

108
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:17.150
it's a very weird feeling because you feel the building like rocking back and

109
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.810
forth and it's,
it's disconcerting.
You know,
it's like Whoa,

110
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.400
this thing fucking moves man.

111
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.700
But there's a constant moving and swaying with the wind and it's very minute and

112
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.580
sometimes you can feel it like it was a heavy storm,

113
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.310
but most of the time you can't hold.

114
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:38.311
The Russians had figured out how to make some piece of sound equipment power by

115
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:41.150
that.
So it had no external power source.

116
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.230
It was completely powered by the movement of the building and so the device

117
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:49.610
would turn on.
Wow.
So it's not,
he was walking,
it would turn out well.

118
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.620
So I don't know the specifics but I know that it was a very sophisticated device

119
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.180
that was powered by the movement of the building.

120
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.280
I think a lot of those are voice activated,

121
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.730
but you know like I used to have a voice activated tape recorder and at one

122
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.740
point I was trying to hook it up to the tank,
my isolation tank.

123
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:06.440
So they don't want them in the tank.
And I have a great idea.

124
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.910
I could just say it in a record it,

125
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:12.800
but I never just didn't use it because the idea is we're just common.

126
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.190
I like when you're in the tank,
the ideas are just coming at you like wet fish.

127
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.730
I know.
Try to catch them,
just try to hold onto one.
But they're,

128
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.690
they're really hard.
And that tank,
I tried to have no thoughts.
That's hard to do.

129
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.610
But this guy,
um,
uh,
you know,
swift,

130
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.590
that was when Swick was telling me these,
these guys,

131
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.710
whoever had set this equipment up in there,

132
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.330
they were using sophisticated equipment that the US government didn't even know

133
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.230
existed.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's always been a,

134
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:46.010
a technological race.
We were far ahead of them in Nicole war.

135
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.840
Just be sort of cut out,
switch.
Not with,
not with rocketry,
not with a,

136
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.970
the space program.
The space program.
Like there's,

137
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.910
you're always gonna have problems whenever there is a country where people don't

138
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:03.230
have the motivation to succeed and achieve because they don't get financially

139
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:06.960
rewarded or they're constrained by that sort of,
you know,

140
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.990
they have this sort of imperialistic,
Russian sort of economy.

141
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.530
It's a very different way of achieving success.

142
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:19.430
You achieve success if you get in with the right group of people and you have to

143
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:21.610
play the right politics and economy of influence.

144
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.500
You can't just be some fucking nomad,

145
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.460
some rogue investor who goes out and kicks ass.
It makes a lot of money.

146
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.000
They take those guys and they take their money and they locked him up in jail.

147
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.600
That's right.
I mean it's,

148
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.040
Putin has done that to many of these oligarch billionaire characters in these,

149
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.830
they made a lot of those guys made,

150
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:43.100
was going into politics and criticizing the government who didn't had sort of an

151
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:44.810
unwritten law that said,
you can make your money.

152
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.850
You got to pass a little something,
but you can make them money.

153
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.560
You start making noise about politics and that's what they did to,

154
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:56.100
what's his name?
The guy owned Yukos oil,
I think it's called the biggest oil.
And

155
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.510
<v 1>they storm this plane and I think he's still in jail.
No,
just let him out.</v>

156
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.490
They let them out.
But I think it's the same guy you're talking about.
Um,

157
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.130
it took all,
his was very famous case.
Took everything.
It took everything.

158
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.460
When you have a government like that,
when you don't have property rights,

159
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:15.570
when you don't have due process,
when you don't have objective law,
uh,

160
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.140
what happens is who in the world is going to work really hard to create a

161
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.010
company when the guy with the biggest guns can come along and take it again.

162
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:23.700
It is,

163
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
I'd love to sit down and ask him how he thinks that strategy makes any sense.

164
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.240
You know,
he's not thinking that it makes sense.
He's thinking that he can do it.

165
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.140
Yeah.

166
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.520
It's a very short sided thing that ironically makes your country way weaker.

167
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.310
It lowers your death,
your,
your life expectancy and everything rushes.

168
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.310
And one Rusch is a one crop economy oil and now that oil's at $40 a barrel when

169
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:52.140
it was at hundred,
they're having a major crisis.

170
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.490
Do you think that is part of the US strategy to fuck with them?
Absolutely not.

171
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.870
No,
absolutely not.

172
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.220
So you don't think the US government has any control whatsoever on the amount of

173
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.180
the price,
the price of oil?
Absolutely not.
It was in pot.

174
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.530
Russia's biggest problem is that their history has,

175
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.450
has either given rise to czars kings or a different kind of Tsar,

176
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.760
which is the communist dictator.
You know,

177
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.990
the Russians are a very industrious people and,

178
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.821
and you know,

179
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:23.730
you wonder what they would be capable of doing if they lived in a society where

180
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:27.880
the incentive structure rewarded you for your work and your ingenuity.
Right.

181
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.950
Unfortunately,

182
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.720
they have always lived under some kind of an autocracy,

183
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.570
some kind of oligarchies.
It's never been different.

184
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.810
I mean Putin is essentially a czar and he has his small group of people around

185
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:46.140
them.
Um,
so,
so I believe that it has nothing to do with the United States.

186
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.020
In fact,
it has everything to do with the philosophy.

187
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.650
That's not what I meant though.
Honestly.
I agree with you on all that.

188
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.150
But what I'm in is a price of oil.

189
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:57.840
Do you think it's manipulated to fuck with events?
I don't think it's possible.

190
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.750
Oh,
oils and a worldwide economy.
A commodity.

191
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.170
And so when it's traded on the worldwide economy commodity,

192
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.620
nobody's controlling oil.
Oil is out there and traded.
Right?
How's it going?

193
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:09.960
Do you know how it goes up and down?

194
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:13.360
Like when oil goes from fort at $40 a barrel,
a hundred dollars bell.

195
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.140
How's it do that?
I don't know the intricacies of that,

196
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:20.070
but I do know that one of the reasons it went from a hundred to $40 a barrel
was,

197
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.090
was fracking in this country.

198
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.280
And when we had our own access to massive oil shales.
Yeah,
that's a big deal.

199
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.990
It's incredible.
It's changed everything.
And when,

200
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:33.080
and all of a sudden we're no longer,
we're no longer dependent on Russian oil.
Uh,

201
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.970
other people aren't as dependent on rational.

202
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.110
They can buy our oil for cheaper or there's just a glut.

203
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:41.310
There's just more oil and when there's more oil being traded on the world stage,

204
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.570
the price will come down.
There is not a scarcity of oil.
I mean in fact,

205
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.060
oil now in 2015 I think is now.
Uh,

206
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.080
I mean the price of gas is ridiculously cheap because it's nobody expected

207
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.950
<v 0>this kind of technology to create that much oil that quickly.</v>

208
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.480
What does he know if fracking though seems like no matter what anybody says,

209
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.090
I mean there there's,
there's going to be debate.

210
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.640
Anytime there's anything controversial then anytime that there's any sort of

211
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.860
environmental risk was something like that.

212
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.190
It's hard to separate the facts from the noise.
Yes.

213
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.240
But it seems without a doubt that some areas are getting contaminated.

214
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.350
It seems without a doubt that some rivers and getting polluted so well systems

215
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:24.250
are getting fucked up.

216
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.110
That movie Gasland got criticized for some inaccuracies,

217
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:32.110
but they couldn't criticize all of it.
You know,
there's,

218
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:36.040
there's some undeniable aspects to fracking and also the potential aspects to

219
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:39.460
any kind of energy technology cause it,

220
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:43.480
the fact of the matter is civilization and feeding the civilization and energy

221
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:46.530
source is going to be at this point polluting.
Um,

222
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:48.970
and I think the way out of it is,
is you know,

223
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:52.540
a lot of people favor legislation and I think they might be a place for

224
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:56.410
legislation of course.
But I think what's really going to get us out of,
um,

225
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.740
that kind of an issue is technology is just create more incentives.

226
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.900
I don't care if it's through the government or you know,

227
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.560
government grants or private enterprise create incentives for smart people to

228
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:11.470
come up with clean technology.
And that's what we're doing.
You know,

229
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.410
that's kind of where,
where,
um,
you want to head,
you know,

230
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:17.110
it's not like there's going to be some sort of an instant solution for the

231
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:20.500
pollution of the atmosphere or the ocean.
But it seems like with people,

232
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.360
people are really fucking smart.

233
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.720
There's these giant leaps that they make every now and then and a lot of them

234
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:26.620
are due to pressure.

235
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.100
And then there's some real pressure where people worried about the environment

236
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.740
100% and there's going to be people way smarter than us.

237
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:34.090
They're going to figure some ways around it.

238
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.040
Like did you see about that 19 year old kid came up with a device to um,

239
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.290
clean all the,
a plastic out of the ocean?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.

240
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:43.870
He wants some prize for it,
Jamie.
See if you could find that.

241
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.460
It's like some gigantic fucking skimmer that's going to go over the Pacific

242
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:53.020
garbage patch and it sucks the plastic out and I think it puts it to use.
See,

243
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:56.650
the thing about like plastic is if you could actually get it out of the ocean,

244
00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:00.100
it's w it's valuable.
It has a value.
Well,
there's more.
What does that,

245
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.290
they did some things.
There's an island of plastic,

246
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.140
the size of the continental United States or something's not quite that big,

247
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:07.990
but it's like,
it's,
it's not necessarily an island to either,

248
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:10.420
like I've described it as an island and people have corrected me.

249
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.150
What it is is like soup.
Yes.
It's like there's the where the winning pieces.
Yeah.

250
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.760
They're very small.
They're very small.
And let's look at where the tide has.

251
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:21.940
You know there's,
there's areas where there's like a,
the currents,

252
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.600
they put things into like a,
a circulation and then it'll,

253
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.880
it'll all accumulate in this one area.
But it's like,

254
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.050
I think that any problem as a solution,
I actually really,
as I get older,
I,
I'm,

255
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.430
I'm way less cynical,
cynical.
I think the,
here it is right here,
ocean cleanup.

256
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.280
So this guy has figured out some way,
and um,
correct me if I'm wrong,
Jamie's,

257
00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:44.050
this is the same one where there's a 19 year old kid who created this

258
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.340
damn,
I didn't see anything about this.

259
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.100
This might be a different thing because I never saw this part before.

260
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.540
We googled a,
the story from like 2013 when it was going home.

261
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.500
I just researched the new,
the new name to find them some updated stories on it.

262
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.020
Oh,
so this is the update.
Yeah.
This is their actual website.

263
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.030
Largest cleanup in history.
So they're going to create some gigantic,

264
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.230
huge machine.

265
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.610
It's probably gonna create a lot of jobs and they're going to suck all that

266
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:15.140
fucking plastic out of the ocean.

267
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.000
The real problem too is not just the plastic in the ocean,
but overfishing.

268
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.370
We kill a lot of fucking fish.
You know,
I wonder though,
if there's a way,

269
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.930
I mean they have hatcheries.
I wonder if there's a way for us to,
uh,

270
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.290
create hatcheries that release fish into the wild because we have hatcheries

271
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:37.400
that release a salmon.
We do it with salmon and we do a trout.
You know,

272
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:42.050
there's places where you fish for trout and the fish all come from hatcheries

273
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.320
and they stocked the fish.
Well,
the problem with is the dead zones,

274
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:47.960
the ecological dead zones in the bottom of the ocean where they turn the

275
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:50.960
trawlers with a drag for shellfish and stuff.

276
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.160
They drag these giant sort of clause that collect everything,

277
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.460
the size of semis.
And they just do that too.

278
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:01.640
And there are areas in the Atlantic that are massive dead zones.

279
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:05.000
There's some crazy amount like areas of size of western Europe that are

280
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:08.900
literally dead zones.
There's no,
there's no fucking plants growing down.

281
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:12.350
There was no oxygen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The coral gets devastated.

282
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.160
But I had linguine with clams last night.
It was delicious.

283
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:19.520
I'm not going to go pick those fucking clowns.
I it was going to get me claims.

284
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.960
We'll figure it did it.
It's him looking at this same guy.
What a cool name.

285
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:28.010
Boyan slat.
Yeah.
He sounds like a wizard.
He's a Dutch entrepreneur.

286
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.930
Dutch high.
Highest Fuck guaranteed entrepreneur and inventor.

287
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.950
This kid.
This is the guy to get on the podcast now.
Before it becomes too big.

288
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.730
You need to find him.
Find him,
Jamie.
Make a note,
make a mental note.

289
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.020
Call Matt Stacks.
Find this young man will fly him out from Holland.

290
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.280
Tell him that we have,
we'd let him know.
He's only 19.
We could corrupt him.

291
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.660
Take them around.
Brian.
Red Bands.
Girls.
Exactly.
Spring.

292
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.580
That's Kryptonite for any team.
Just dirty places.
Yeah.

293
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.830
We had Alex Honnold on who is this?
Uh,

294
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.590
like one of the best free climbers can the world.
Yeah.

295
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.850
He is the complete name and he does it without ropes.
Yeah,
he does.

296
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:07.250
He does it with ropes first to map out his course.

297
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.730
Obviously you have to make sure that you can do it without ropes,

298
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.060
so you've got to do it with ropes first,
but then he just makes a decision,

299
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:17.150
knows what he can do and what he can't do.
Anyway,
he was like,

300
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.660
like real mellow and like steady until Brian brought up girls and porn stars and

301
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:29.230
you know,
it's just like what really?
Cause we they're inviting them to or him.

302
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.890
We were inviting him to go to Vegas.

303
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:35.180
There was a UFC in Vegas and we were doing a show out there and the guy's eyes

304
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.220
lit up like,
yeah,
it's funny.

305
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.400
It's just like you're not getting any pussy on that mountain.
I see it.

306
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.010
It's like the most plus the script,
Mac comedy.

307
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.940
A lot of these guys or women that can change your whole life.

308
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.650
What's that man's name again?
That young young fellow.
Bryant.
Buoyant,

309
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.160
buoyant slot.
Boyan slat guarantee you.

310
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.050
There's some girls out there that are reading the same thing,

311
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.460
especially dirty girls.
Listen to this podcast.
They're going to find him.

312
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.540
They want to get it finance.
The young Dutch suck money out of his Dick.

313
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.950
He's probably super tall girls.
Super Tall,
thin.
It doesn't matter if he is,

314
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.470
but he's actually the tos.
Men in Europe buy you a belly,

315
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.730
just suck it out of his Dick.

316
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.420
Then you get who could literally suck a Bentley out of his deck.

317
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.560
You just have to suck hard enough and just gently work the ball.

318
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.960
He just started crying into his pocket.
Yes.
Just be magical to him.

319
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.470
Be a magical nymph who came out of nowhere.

320
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.630
Just came out of the woods and get a get a trap phone.
Right.

321
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.620
All those guys that are sending you Dick Pictures,
don't give that number two.

322
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.110
What's the name again?
Boyan don't give it to black.

323
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.570
It's kind of funny that it is something that involves water and he's kind of

324
00:18:38.571 --> 00:18:43.390
buoyant.
Yeah.
You know Boyan yeah,
that's all we need man.

325
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.640
Put One,
one girl,
one girl with a fucking an iPhone with no contacts on.

326
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.020
She's only getting messages from extort him for money.
Hi there.
Was she at?

327
00:18:52.021 --> 00:18:53.430
Let's leave that phone laying around.

328
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.580
Never has to worry about getting in trouble cause it just dicks and vibrating

329
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.790
decks,
man.

330
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.680
Get some Russian gow some Russian Gal that maybe you met when you were 17 it's

331
00:19:03.681 --> 00:19:06.480
still your sneaker,
so get her,
get her to find Boyan.

332
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.350
I Bet Putin Putin with fucking send his his attackers,

333
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:14.460
he's probably got a little train Parana women he's trained over guarantee.

334
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.950
Does all bang everybody in the fucking cabinet or whatever they have parlor.

335
00:19:17.951 --> 00:19:21.840
There's a lot of fucking in the parliament.
Them is fucking with masks.

336
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.780
Well that's one of the reasons why star wars are so ridiculous,
okay?

337
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.920
Because Darth Vader had no motivation.
Darth Vader wasn't getting any pussy,
okay?

338
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.070
He was just being evil.
There was no money.

339
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.660
He wasn't like rolling around in money.
Domination has a right for what?

340
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.990
For what?
To wear that stupid mask.
Come on.
What are you going to do?

341
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.410
You can't even exist without that stupid helmet on and you're going to dominate

342
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.700
the universe and then what you,

343
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:47.220
when you're already winning and winning where you around,

344
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.230
you could choke them without even using your hands.

345
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.290
You can fake choke him from a distance and kill him.
What do you want?

346
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.410
But you wonder about people like gang is kind of what motivated him.

347
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:58.860
It was a plus.
He had bullies.
Hey,
do you know how much puts you that guy?

348
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.680
100 a male.
China,
Chinese men aged directly.
Yes.

349
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.000
Directly related to [inaudible].
He changed the fucking ecosystem.
It's crazy,

350
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:09.930
dude.
There's,

351
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.190
there was a New York Times article that said that he killed so many people,

352
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:19.191
something around 10% of the world's population died while he was alive.

353
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:23.670
Directly because of his decisions.
Yeah.
It was so different.

354
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:28.380
Biggest asshole on the planet or a great guy who was misunderstood.

355
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.010
It was killing a lot of assholes,
I think.

356
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.380
I bet everybody back then was an asshole dealing with 1200 and fucking kill 'em

357
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:38.100
all.
What do they know what Dan Carlin says?

358
00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:41.820
You have to wonder what the strength of his nature was to wake up and say,

359
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:45.780
I want the world.
I want that,
which I can't even see.

360
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.040
He got a scouting guy,
came back and said,
look,

361
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 2>there are people with blond hair and blue eyes and what in what was Russia?</v>

362
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.740
And they said,
we should go get those too.
And he was like,
all right,

363
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.610
let's go take them over to,
well,
not only that,

364
00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:00.850
they were willing to go through so much hardship they,

365
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.180
they crossed into Moscow in the winter.
Yes.
Because there was no Samara,

366
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.550
she area that you could only cross through in the winter when it was frozen

367
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:10.230
solid.
But they,

368
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.420
no one ever thought that anybody would do that because it was so harsh.

369
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:15.970
The climate so harsh,
the Mongols didn't give a fuck.

370
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.670
They never wash their clothes.
They ate rats,
they ate each other.

371
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.340
Occasionally they'd run out of food.
There's,
there's,

372
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:24.220
that's disputed apparently according to drank coffee drink their,
uh,

373
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.630
their mare's milk and blood.
Yeah.

374
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.370
They would say cut their horses and then fill their,
uh,

375
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:32.290
their class with horse and mares blood.

376
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.570
And that's what they would survive on for days at a time.
Yeah.

377
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.230
They were just so fucking crazy.
Life in the Gobi desert on that,

378
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.100
on the step was already so insanely harsh,
insanely hard.
Sure.

379
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.840
Primarily a carnivore and the way they would hunt and catch birds and catch,

380
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.530
you know,
the deer and the whatever was there with their horses.

381
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.650
It was just a very harsh,
harsh way to live.
Well,

382
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:58.150
there's a reality to people that you could always take more,
you know,

383
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.090
most of the time,
up until the point where it kills you,
you could take more.

384
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.930
You know,
I was watching Rinella media the other day.

385
00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:09.310
He had an episode on,
I don't want to say the name wrong,
Nan Nan Novak,

386
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.430
Nanu Vac island outside of a Alaska.

387
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.740
You can get to it when the fucking ocean freezes.
You can walk.

388
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:20.470
They're not doing that hunting trip.
They take,

389
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.250
they take jet skis across the frozen ocean,
Dan.
Okay.

390
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.240
And these people are out there and they hunt for this thing called a Muskox,

391
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.640
which has this enormous beast of an animal,

392
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:35.170
which I may go hunting in Greenland with Cam Haynes,

393
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:38.740
who might do an archery muskox hunt because apparently you can hunt them in the

394
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.790
dry green.

395
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:42.080
You don't have to be an asshole and be out there in the middle of the night.

396
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.550
Thomas died,
died hunting from muskox.

397
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.960
They taste delicious.
They taste like ribeye steak.

398
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.360
It's like it's just incredibly delicious fat,

399
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:56.500
big fat animal because they're just constantly eating to try to keep fat on,

400
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.450
to keep them warm.
And they're,

401
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:02.230
they're ridiculously cool looking and there's a lot of them.
So they're like,

402
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.540
yeah.
And in Greenland apparently there are.
Wow.

403
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.950
And will they thrive so you can go hunting for them in the grass where it's not

404
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:13.540
that exactly where you're doing it in the Arctic,
if you're doing it in Alaska,

405
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.990
you're hunting forum on these frozen Tundras.

406
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.680
It's crazy to watch Sam shirt and was telling me that they went to rescue.

407
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.690
I think they were hunting and Muskox uh,

408
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.880
but they went to rescue these guys who had been out on a hunt and they were

409
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:32.800
already,
they were so cold.
They were already dying of,
of frostbite,
hypothermia.

410
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.480
And they,
what they got there,

411
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:36.990
they were taking all their clothes off because what happens,
you know,

412
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.890
the blood rushes to your,
yeah,
you think you're burning.
They say wait a die.

413
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.010
Meanwhile,
you're going to go to the cryogenic chamber after this today.
Yes.

414
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:45.980
First Time Bring

neoprene,
Afrin,

417
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.790

Really.

418

You got to feel great.
I'm going to come out hug and I'll come alimony.

419

Oh,

I was like,

420
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.800
this is an incredible,
like the,

the,

421
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.820
the village was less than 200 people and you know,

422
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:17.570
it's just nothing but white.
You look around,
it's just frozen everything.

423
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.050
The ground is flat and white and goes on for as far as the eye can see.

424
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.240
And these people live in there,
man,

425
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.270
and they had the little kids and their kids were living there and they were all

426
00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:29.330
bundled up except their faces.
They're like,
what's,
you know?
Ronell was like,

427
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:34.250
what's your favorite food?
He's like,
I like to eat,
seal the seal and Walrus.

428
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.120
Walrus is my favorite food.
So hearing walrus falling,
staying alive with,

429
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.730
if life started in east Africa,

430
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:42.830
there were some people that have just kept moot walking north.

431
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:46.040
Fuck Spain and the sunshine and the grass.
I don't want that now.

432
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.730
It's going where it's icy and it gets dark at noon.
Yeah,
this is home.

433
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.000
They didn't know any better man.
They didn't know where they were going.
I mean,

434
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:54.560
a lot of this,
when this happened,

435
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.620
people had a rudimentary understanding of navigation.

436
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:02.770
They just went in search of food and kept going and stay together and then wound

437
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:03.681
up here.
I mean,

438
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:08.020
nobody would have gone across the fucking Bering strait if they knew.
Right.

439
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.950
They just kept going.
They just kept going.
Really?

440
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.030
Everybody should have stayed in Africa.
Yeah.
Although the Fertile Crescent,

441
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:18.020
it was even where you want to be.

442
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:21.060
Like Iraq or a number started cause you could have,

443
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.640
you had grasses that crew like barley and millet and wheat and it was easy just

444
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.090
the way and you could domesticate animals.
Well you know,

445
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.650
that's when they first started important coffee.
That's why the column era,
Becca,

446
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.960
Arabic Arabica beans.
Yeah.
It all came from Ethiopia.

447
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.990
All of us are that a fascinating gentleman on my podcast.

448
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.890
Um,
what's his name?
Peter.
I'm trying to figure his,
the last name.

449
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.310
Italian find it.
Um,
he was out a coffee guy,

450
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.260
an expert,
a real coffee expert and a really cool guy.
And uh,

451
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.840
he ran down the history.

452
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.240
What does his name Peter Juliano Juliano I've heard,

453
00:26:00.241 --> 00:26:01.220
and tell me if this is right.

454
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:05.120
The Myth I heard was that Ethiopian goat farmers were watching their goats eat

455
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:07.250
these berries and they got,

456
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.980
they would get a pep in their step and have more energy when they were done

457
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:13.490
eating the berries.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Then the shepherds were like,
well,

458
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:16.490
if they eat and maybe I'll eat him and it makes sense.
Yeah.

459
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.970
And based on their other types of cooking the way you would,
you know,

460
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.990
Cook something.
They decided let's try to roast these beans and see what happens.

461
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.980
That makes sense.
I wonder,
I wonder if that's the case.
You know,

462
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:29.890
that was an issue with um,
uh,

463
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.200
that's how they figured out the cordyceps mushroom to cordyceps mushrooms,

464
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:34.820
high altitude hurting populations.

465
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:37.490
They're watching the animals eat these mushrooms and their animals would have

466
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:40.310
like more energy and you're like,
Huh,
what the fuck's going on here?

467
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.440
And they figured out that it helps an oxygen utilization.

468
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:46.860
That was before like the Chinese Olympic teams started using them.
Wow.
Yeah,

469
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.120
it's cool.
And you know,

470
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:52.380
you get animals to a try out food for you see if they die.

471
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.670
But the problem is like this some shit that they can't eat that we can eat for

472
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:59.660
the most part though,
they say that,
that uh,
like with dogs and they,

473
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:01.890
if the dogs eat onions,
it makes him anemic and stuff.

474
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.520
But for the most part they say if a birds eating it,
I've heard this,
I dunno,

475
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.000
you can eat it,
you can eat it.
Say if an animal's eating it,
but then again,

476
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:10.350
I think birds eat certain berries.

477
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:12.120
I mean there are certain berries and mushrooms you can eat.

478
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.450
You eat like half a mushroom and you're dead.
Yeah.

479
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:19.590
There's certain mushrooms that look real similar to psychedelic mushrooms.

480
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.460
And if you eat them,
you have like instant liver toxicity.

481
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.070
Like you might have to get a liver transplant,
you're going to die.

482
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.540
How fucked is that man?
You know,
there was an old lady,
um,
well not just one.

483
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:34.020
I think there was several people that died in a nursing home because this old

484
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:37.380
guy or old Gal,
I forget which one it was,
um,

485
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:41.310
went out in search of mushrooms and brought back with some mushrooms and cooked

486
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:44.980
it for everyone in the nursing home and they fucking die.
Well,
the,
you know,
the,

487
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.940
the Oleander is super poisonous and I heard,

488
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:50.640
and it is only in blander is you see it,

489
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:54.120
it's like a nondescript kind of Bush with,
you know,

490
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.870
big kind of long cylindrical leaves.
And,
uh,

491
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.980
these guys used an oleander branch to cook their lamb.
These tourists,

492
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:06.360
they ran an oleander match and whatever,

493
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.600
whatever happened,
the PSAP got in the meat and they fucking died.

494
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.560
And then they had this really expensive a race horse.

495
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.150
And I don't remember where this,
this,
you know,
was,

496
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.780
you know how those resources are $100 million.
Like somehow that race was eight.

497
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:22.960
A couple of oleander leaves and died.
John Taylor,

498
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.070
why did you have oleander near the,
the horses stable.

499
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.720
Let's see a picture of oleander.
Jamie,
I need you to know that this stuff is,

500
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:35.430
that leaves fucking toxic.
That's tough right there.
I believe so.
So pretty.
Yeah,

501
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:35.970
it is.

502
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.540
Isn't it weird that like a lot of really pretty things are fucking terrible for

503
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:40.890
you,
Huh?
What girls?

504
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.450
You could lose your house.

505
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.060
The guys that like are like not used to really hot girls and you see it coming

506
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.300
when the guys who didn't get those girls in the high school and college and then

507
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:55.020
they,

508
00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.020
then what happens is they get famous and they're 38 40 and they're kind of Dorky

509
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.300
or release.
Same as Nate date.
That trophy wife.

510
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.240
Well or they meet a girl and a strip club or whatever it is.

511
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.170
You've gotta be careful.
I was at this,
uh,

512
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.530
steak house the other night in Beverly Hills,
like guess very swank place.
Oh,

513
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.140
needed names,
sorry.
Very swank establishment.

514
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.290
But I was astonished by the number of disgusting men with attractive women.

515
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.630
I was like,
this is a fascinating,
like this guy.

516
00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:28.620
I hope he can play a mean set of drums or fucking belt out a great tune or

517
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:32.370
something.
I mean,
how did he get her?
Like,
what's going on here?
Just really,

518
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:36.990
really rich guys in Beverly Hills especially that is where the oldest profession

519
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:40.620
in the world is rampant.
Just prostitution.

520
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.190
It's a different kind of prostitution

521
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.750
<v 2>cause it's legal.
All you're just,</v>

522
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:48.160
you're just professional girlfriends and wives for like really ugly dude.

523
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.870
Keep mad.
I buy her Scott.
I just got an apartment.

524
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.200
She's got a house.
I just got out the car.
Um,

525
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.810
another thing we found fascinating was the amount of Arab license plates,

526
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.640
Saudi Arabian plates,
they fly their fucking supercars over here.
There was a,

527
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:09.220
um,
a Bugatti VA Ron,

528
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.880
which is a one point something million dollar car,

529
00:30:11.881 --> 00:30:16.330
this insane car and the palace plate.
It said something palace,

530
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:21.010
cause I was with a friend who's Persian and he reads Arabic and he said it said

531
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.120
palace.

532
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.120
And then the number plate was like 222,222 like that was the plate was all twos

533
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:31.050
and it said palace and it was just fucking,
I don't know,

534
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.260
I'm like one point something million dollar car.
Oh you like cars right now.

535
00:30:35.261 --> 00:30:37.480
And I'm like those,
what is that car?
What is the,

536
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:38.920
well here's the problem with those cars.

537
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.850
I mean they're incredible pieces of technology.
I mean they're,

538
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.870
they're undeniable.
The speed,
the power,
the opulence,

539
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.770
the interior is gorgeous and beautiful and it,
and like,

540
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.120
it's one of those things at Floyd Mayweather drives around in,

541
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.260
but what I like is I like cars that are tactile.

542
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.590
I don't even necessarily like new cars.
I like,

543
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:01.680
like I'm missing something that can really drive oh yeah.

544
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.020
Moving towards like older and older cars.
Like,

545
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:08.620
even my Porsche is the newest car that I have.
That's a 2007 and I,

546
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.390
that's the last year that they made the gt three or the last model that they

547
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:16.630
made,
the gt three Rs.
The way mine is,
it doesn't have any,
uh,

548
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.050
like there's no stability control.
There's some traction control,

549
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:21.890
limited amount of traction control.
That's,

550
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.190
it's a race car and you could shut that off and you're on your own.

551
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:28.420
You just have this 520 pound horsepower ridiculously light car that you feel

552
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:32.800
everything you're telling me it only weighs 520 pounds.
No,
no,
520 horsepower.

553
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:36.490
Okay.
It's less than 3000 pounds,
but somewhere around 3000 pounds.

554
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.630
But what I'm interested in honestly,
is like 1970s cars,

555
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.170
like 1970 Porsche.
That's 2000 pounds.

556
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.190
Like a thousand pounds less and less powerful.
But you feel everything.

557
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:52.510
No power steering.
You feel the fucking bumps of the car,
you feel the road,

558
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:56.510
you feel that like literally you feel in your ass right word for them.

559
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.860
You feel when the car's rear end is breaking loose?
If you're,

560
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:04.210
when the tires are losing traction,
you sliding a little bit.
That's fun.
Yeah.

561
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.990
Like all this other shit,
like it's physical,
they're all computers is like,
whoa.

562
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.330
Like I drove a Nissan Gtr.

563
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:14.140
Do you know one of those are now it's just incredibly technologically

564
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:17.350
sophisticated rocket ship that Nissan's built.

565
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.670
It's almost like a,
a proof of concept vehicle.

566
00:32:21.671 --> 00:32:24.280
Like the almost like they lose money on it.

567
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:29.281
It's a flagship vehicle and it's so fucking unbelievably ridiculously competent

568
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:34.060
and fast.
That car right there,
it goes zero to 60 in less than three seconds.

569
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:38.500
It's pretty understated.
It's not like,
well it's,
it's everything's functional.

570
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.520
That car as it's not about like,

571
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:43.110
I think it looks cool because it looks like a spaceship.
Yeah.

572
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:48.320
But everything about it is about aerodynamics and about keeping the body pinned

573
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:52.340
to the ground.
It's heavy.
It's about 3,900 pounds.

574
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:55.430
So it was like 900 pounds more than my car is.

575
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.440
And it's four wheel drive,

576
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:02.150
which like race car drivers traditionally like a rear wheel drive car because

577
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:05.060
they liked the feel that it's pushing instead of pulling,

578
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.590
they liked to the control that you get because you can kind of steer with the

579
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:14.330
throttle if you know as you're going into a turn is a thing called oversteer,

580
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:18.230
right?
So if you're going into a turn and uh,
as you're going into a turn,

581
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.380
you can hit the gas and your ass and we'll kick out and it'll change the angle

582
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:27.590
over entry into the turn.
You got to know how to do it just right.

583
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:31.100
You have to have this field.
So you've got to know like,

584
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.730
like it's more fun than anything cause really the correct line if you're on a

585
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:39.260
race course is to have no,
no ass and kickout like you want it,

586
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.830
you want everything to be glued.
Every time you're asking kicks out,

587
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:46.010
if you're racing,
you're going to lose seconds.
But for fun,

588
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:50.540
like guys who love like those kind of,
uh,
like like a nine,
11,

589
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:53.890
like in 1979,
11.
One of the things that they like about it is the asset.

590
00:33:53.891 --> 00:33:56.730
And we'll kick Alec.
This has got Chris Harris.
I've had him in here as well.

591
00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.080
A tail happy that it's,
yeah,
it's,
it's oversteer.

592
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.200
Chris Harris is a very famous uh,
automotive journalist from the,
uh,

593
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.490
UK and he takes it to the next level.

594
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.120
He likes to power slide around corners.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
I,

595
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.180
well,
watching him do it,

596
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:16.940
he's an artist at it and he's going around corners in these cars.

597
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:21.920
Every car he reviews he takes and he power slides like everywhere.
It's just,

598
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:27.630
just power sliding these fucking things like go meaning like the Chris Harris

599
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:30.980
kind of gt three Rs,
2016 gt three Rs.

600
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.100
He's literally going sideways around corners with a 500 horsepower,

601
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.730
$200,000 Porsche that they let him borrow.

602
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.240
That's so they let him borrow this car,

603
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.520
just beating the fuck out of it everywhere he goes.
No,
that's a,

604
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:50.270
that's an old one.
No,
no,
look up.
That's,
that's my year.

605
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.330
That's like a 2007 2016 gt three go down there.

606
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.570
So it says gt three Rs accelerations.
Empower slide c.

607
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

608
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.760
<v 2>Yeah.
You could see it probably were there you,
you won't see Chris Harris do it,</v>

609
00:35:03.761 --> 00:35:06.190
but you'll see a car that does it.

610
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.470
And the idea is that these guys go around these fucking corners and they go

611
00:35:11.471 --> 00:35:15.370
around these corners using the ass end of the car.

612
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.480
Like using,

613
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.260
<v 3>yeah,</v>

614
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.300
<v 2>no,
let me see if they do it later.</v>

615
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.133
<v 3>Okay.</v>

616
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.000
<v 2>Um,
but anyway,
it's just fun.
Cool.
Look,
go Chris Harris,</v>

617
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.570
gt three Rs,
2016 Gulu that

618
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.870
and then you'll see,
huh?
Chris Harrison cars top one,
top one.
Yeah.

619
00:35:36.871 --> 00:35:41.550
Now like three quarters of the way in there and you'll see him on a race track

620
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.670
with it even further air.
Here's this crazy fucker.

621
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:49.450
Like this guy's a mad man and he just knows how to drive a this

622
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.863
<v 4>great.</v>

623
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.700
<v 2>See right there.
He's just leaving a little bit of rubber.</v>

624
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.410
He's just trying to go fast as fast as he can.
See how he's taking these lines,

625
00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.940
the outside to the inside.

626
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:04.941
It's all about trying to go around corners in a straight a line as possible so

627
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:08.940
that you have as little pressure on the tires,
uh,

628
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.590
sideways as possible.

629
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.440
And it's all about like choosing the correct line to go around the corners.

630
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.450
Most officially it would be more macho,
but see,
no,
he's not.

631
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.750
He's a thug and he's not in real life though.
But here it looks,

632
00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:27.750
see all that rubber look he's going sideways around the corner,
that damn.

633
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.580
Give some volumes so he can hear that cause he's just having a great fucking
dog.

634
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:33.940
We wanted me to hear it.
We don't have our heads up.

635
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.770
<v 4>Just mega lovely little sleepy feeling on the end,</v>

636
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.150
<v 2>Slippy feeling that guy fucking loves cars.</v>

637
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.063
<v 4>See that.</v>

638
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.060
Just don't want me to range really thumps you out.
Definitely has more traction.

639
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.170
<v 2>If you have a car and you're selling it,</v>

640
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.940
you want a motherfucker like this review in it.
This guy loves cars,

641
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.700
he loves him and he's smart as shit.

642
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.590
Man really understands automobiles.
It's funny how you have when it,

643
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.020
when you told her that she sounded really,
really smile.
A yeah man.

644
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:14.780
That's why they sell fucking mops with that voice.
You want this mop,
this mop,

645
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.250
mop,
and the world's most sophisticated in that mock.
You're going to bass,
right?

646
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.040
It's simulated to Musk ox and Scott.

647
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.510
Really fantastic.
Something ability.
So you don't,

648
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.400
you don't find a thrill in this sort of,
uh,
automotive automotive fucker.

649
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.770
There's nothing about this is appealing to you.
If you got power slot.

650
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.840
Bernard Hopkins is talking about how he sets up his jab.

651
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:39.180
That's interesting to me.
How does this not interesting to you?

652
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:41.310
I feel I'm missing never been interested in cars.

653
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.770
If you've got a broken gene or something wrong with you,

654
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:45.990
you're not even American.
I know you were born out of the country.

655
00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:48.150
That's what it is.
Well,
no,
but how the coach was born.

656
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.720
Remember other countries like what country though?
Where do you want to?

657
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.380
Philippines.
That's the thing.
Philippines not known yet.
Car.

658
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.770
I bet you get crazy when you see a scooter.

659
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.810
I bet if you see like one of those I do.

660
00:37:57.811 --> 00:38:02.190
I go crazy when I see a moped and I see a Rick Shaw.
Um,

661
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.840
hi.
Hi.
You give him a raw coconut,
he loses his fucking mind.

662
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.820
Yeah.
I just never a,
maybe that's what it is.
I was in a Bruce Lee.

663
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.950
I was always in the physical things like that.
Although grace card drives race,

664
00:38:15.951 --> 00:38:19.380
car driving a support.
Absolutely.
I think so.
Right?
Percent.
It seems like,

665
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.060
I mean it's,
you're managing your body as well as managing an automobile.

666
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.690
You without a doubt the one's gotta be a sport.
Well,
it's all,

667
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.340
it's all your own movements.

668
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:31.500
Your movements are dictating the movements of the car,

669
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.640
your movements of the wheel.

670
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.470
Especially in the old days when they would actually shift with the clutch.

671
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.160
Now everything's

672
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.090
<v 0>paddle shifters.</v>

673
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.120
Why do you think Formula One is so huge in Europe and everywhere else and not at

674
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:46.950
all in the United States?
Be standing with God,
our own Nascar up in this,

675
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.060
that big,
I guess it is huge.
If you ever go to like the south,

676
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.140
do you ever go to the radio and like Georgia and they start talking about Nascar

677
00:38:56.141 --> 00:39:00.700
and you're like,
what?
Yeah.
You literally look,
Dale did last weekend,
low t boy.

678
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.960
Let me tell you what,
that guy knows how to drive a car.
I'll tell you what a Gar,

679
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.720
oh,
he's driving a car.
Who's Dale?
We like?
You ain't his late.

680
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:13.120
You didn't see the Nascar is Nascar is Nascar.

681
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.310
I'm not as technical,
isn't it?
Kind of like,
all I know is they let chicks do it.

682
00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:22.890
No,
so sold.
They let girls do it and and you know something.

683
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.780
You know something's up with that score.

684
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.390
I could probably do it better all day.
I can be and have a prenup.

685
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.510
I they compete with men think,
well they claim to be there.

686
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.720
I think that Danica Patrick Chick,
she wins.
It's downright on America,

687
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.860
but she's tough as shit,
man.

688
00:39:38.861 --> 00:39:42.040
It's probably the Ronda Rousey of a race car driving.
He knows how to do it.

689
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.770
Easy on the eyes too.
Not a bad looking Gal.
Not at all.

690
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.130
That's a tough fucking sport though,
for sure.
It's,
it's,

691
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:52.240
you got to maintain your nerves.
You got to figure out when hit the gas,

692
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:53.140
when he hit the brakes,

693
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:56.290
he got to know when to make your move and your piloting that fucking car.

694
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:58.960
It's not automated in any way,
shape or form.

695
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:02.380
It's all up to you to decide how to bust them all.
It's super dangerous.

696
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:05.110
And your reaction time means a lot,
right?
Did they have a clutch?

697
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.920
Does Nascar have a clutch?
Are there those things?
Automatics?

698
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.340
I think they got clutches.
I would hope so.
Being American at all.
Being American.

699
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.030
I don't know.

700
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.260
They make those mother fuckers shift their own gears like Tom Cruise and days.

701
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:24.700
I've done dark nice car like power shifting.

702
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:28.320
Maybe they don't have a clutch.
I don't know.
Are gonna get mad?

703
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:33.190
What happened to America?
What did we do with the left pedal?

704
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:38.260
We need the left pedal.
Bring back the left pedal.
Some bitches.

705
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.440
You uh,
you need to drive a fucking real car,
man.
I need,
you need to go.

706
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:47.320
Go get yourself a Mustang.
Gt three 50.
When they come out,
gas man,

707
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:51.570
shut the fuck I need.
Says Jazz.
What do you,
what do you,
what do you do?

708
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.230
You busy every minute of every day.

709
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.950
You can't stop at a gas station and it put the fucking thing in the slot and go

710
00:40:56.951 --> 00:41:01.300
get yourself over that.
Both hands.
I can't do it's warmed.
No.
Yes.
Swarmed.

711
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.980
Holy Shit.
Stations.
I can't.
The kid is the kid.
Hey man,

712
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.410
Jesus.
What does that a Volkswagen Passat instead of a diesel.

713
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.250
I drove it to get to Tesla.
What do you think?
Great car.
I love it.
Yeah,

714
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.000
I would buy one.

715
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.400
The only thing I wouldn't buy it for is if like you ever have to take your

716
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:21.820
family out of the state.
Fucking shit hits the fan.
Good luck.
Oh,

717
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:23.800
I got another car for that and we need another car for that.

718
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.470
I've got to tell you that I Highland there for that.
But that's a good move.
Yeah,

719
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.830
those are great.
That's a great car.
Yeah.
I mean for a car around town,

720
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.040
it's awesome.
And you know,
the other thing is if you install solar your house,
I

721
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.610
<v 1>do get fucking power that thing easily with solar panels.
Ted,</v>

722
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.460
that's pretty interesting.
I mean you,

723
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.790
I mean obviously it costs money for the batteries and the setup and the

724
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:46.700
maintenance and all that jazz,
but at the end of the day,
um,

725
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:51.970
once the money is spent on setting it up and the operating costs are fairly

726
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:55.190
minimal in comparison to what it would cost to get electricity off the grid,

727
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.140
you can be totally off the grid if you choose to be.

728
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.120
And you can also power your fucking car with all this.
And if the grid goes down,

729
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.490
you can keep your power.
Like there's ways to set that up.
I didn't,

730
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.500
what's interesting is when you put solar panels in your house,
which I did just,

731
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.430
just try getting,
it'll take you the electric company.

732
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.460
It's been three months now and they still haven't converted us.
They haven't,

733
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.930
they just take their sweet time.
What do you mean?
The [inaudible]?
Yes.

734
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.940
They have not yet given us the,
okay.
It's what's the,

735
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:28.190
okay.
They've got to just give you the,
okay.

736
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:29.990
They have to give you some kind of a form.

737
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.360
So are you still spending money on electricity?

738
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.050
Siam but as the electricity being generated by solar or by,

739
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.450
by them still,
they will not let us say we're in ourselves or anything over it.

740
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:43.910
What the fuck is living in a permit?
And guess who has to do that?

741
00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:47.420
Some bureaucrat and the electric company.
Whoa.

742
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:48.920
So there's no dragging their heels.

743
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:52.040
They're trying to keep people from going solar.
Yes.
You sure about that?
Yup.

744
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.030
They sure about the oil price is two minutes.
Come on.
Yeah,
I know these things.

745
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:59.870
Government,
tinfoil conspiracy.
Hi.
Hi Man.
One of the main things,

746
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:03.730
I feel like there's gotta be some way.
Well look man,
here's how I feel like,

747
00:43:03.731 --> 00:43:07.790
like as far as conspiracies concern,
I believe more in ignorance.
So I,
you know,

748
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:11.570
government is my buddy who works,
I just was at his wedding and he said,
he goes,

749
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.140
if you think the government's really efficient and he's talking about

750
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:18.020
intelligence or any of that stuff,
because I've been in the inner circle,
I said,

751
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:20.630
it's not,
you just have to work for the government.
And No,
yes,

752
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:24.980
we do some cool stuff.
But this,
a lot of it's just not as organized.
I'm sure,

753
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.240
and I was thinking about this,
like people tease me for being a history guy.

754
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:34.220
I'm not,
not not like Dan Carlin,
but I tried it,
you know,
read my history.

755
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.890
I was thinking about this,
you know,

756
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.560
this new Harvard study just came out and it said that 170,000,

757
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.990
170,000 veterans from our recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq starting in 2003,

758
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.260
we have 170,000 people that are 70% or more disabled that is probably going to

759
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:58.160
cost over their lifetime than the American economy.

760
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.220
$6 trillion to care for those people,
which you can,

761
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.130
which according to the study you could parse out to be 75 grand of,
uh,

762
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.570
an American family.
Forget the cost.
Forget the cost.

763
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.230
Think about 170,000 people that are 70% or more disabled.
These are,

764
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:13.070
these are veterans.

765
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:16.010
These are people that answered the call and they're all fucked up.

766
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:21.790
And I was thinking about how if the more you read about this war and how we got

767
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:26.730
into it,
a lot of it was because we didn't know the history of that country.
Um,

768
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.070
and a lot of it was because we didn't know the history of the entire region and

769
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.040
would make that argument.

770
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.690
<v 0>And my point is that it's really easy for all of us as voters.</v>

771
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:41.590
It's to go about life without doing the right investigation.

772
00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:45.120
So when you vote for somebody and you vote for a policy,

773
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.470
most of us vote along party lines because our team has over here because we're

774
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:53.100
not a liberal or we're not a conservative,
we're not a Republican,
not a democrat.

775
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:58.230
Instead of looking at the world as,
wait a minute,
we're going to go into Iraq.

776
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.940
Hmm.
That's an interesting thing,
man.
How much do we know about the history?

777
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:05.880
How much do we know about how the country is structured at how much do we know

778
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:06.870
about what's going to happen?

779
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:10.620
We'd when we'd destabilize that regime and when most of Congress didn't know the

780
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:12.630
difference between Sunni and Shia,

781
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.900
which is so important in the eastern politics that schism and we're voting in

782
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:23.571
these policies and I think that that we could have avoided some major tragedy.

783
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.710
I don't know why,
you know,
I'm just saying that,
that the more you know,

784
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.800
the less likely you are to make these major fucking,
he's,

785
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:32.820
you know what's fucked too.

786
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.550
Cause you're kind of damned if you do and you're damned if you don't when it

787
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:39.030
comes to Iraq.
Because if you think about leaving that guy there,

788
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.730
Saddam Hussein was a fucking piece of shit.

789
00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:45.600
He will epic proportions and his children were absolute serial killers.

790
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:50.790
The his children.
There is a story about him and his children from,

791
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:52.140
I forget what magazine it was,

792
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:56.630
maybe like Esquire or something like that for back in the day,
Gq something.
Um,

793
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.390
but it was a terrifying story of all the atrocities that his sons have
committed.

794
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:05.250
Include them taking women on their wedding day as they're being married,

795
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:09.030
kidnapping them,
raping them,
and then feeding them to dogs.
Yeah,

796
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:12.900
it would if feeding the husband and dogs to do all kinds of statistic things,

797
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:14.250
but think about,

798
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:19.050
think about the untold misery that that entire region now over the past 15 years

799
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.180
or actually 13 years has,
has dealt with.

800
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.390
Think about the how many children and how many people think about the Yazidi

801
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:28.950
women sold off into the slavery by these the Isol assholes and the spawning of

802
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.360
ISO would have been the case.
Come up with a standardized name.

803
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.580
I'm tired of hearing I sill,
I says Islamic Cis Sang.

804
00:46:37.581 --> 00:46:40.920
Just say Islamic state,
the space station.
There's too many different,

805
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.790
there are too many fucking isol.
Yeah.
What the fuck?

806
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:48.240
You're the first guy I've ever heard say Isol I've seen it written.
I'm like,

807
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:51.810
what is this?
You know I said it cause it sounds fast.
Fancy cars.

808
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:52.740
I don't know what,
Oh,

809
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:57.810
it's like when John Cutler Mellencamp turned into John Mellencamp remember?

810
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.520
Yeah.
The fuck you.
He made a stand.
He used to be John Cougar.

811
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.660
Mellencamp no,
he was John Mellencamp,
right?
No,
he was John Cougar first.
No,

812
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:07.620
he was John Cougar.

813
00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:11.340
Mellencamp wasn't he then it changed the first time he came out of want to say

814
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:13.860
he was John Cougar and then he became John Cougar mill.

815
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.730
His real name's John Mellencamp obviously.
Yeah,
but it'd be conditionally.
Oh no,

816
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:20.760
he didn't give his name.
He didn't give himself the name.
Cougar.
No,
no,
no.
The,

817
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:25.560
I believe that the record company did here.
That's terrible.
A duty a Jag.

818
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.580
Um,
John titled Miami

819
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:35.110
<v 2>in Australia.
What?
1979.
It's called Miami in Australia.</v>

820
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:40.450
They call his album Miami or he's Miami,
but wait,

821
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.470
John Cougar,
I was talking to the record company to go,
fuck.

822
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.280
That's a test of the album is called Miami.
If you're in Australia,

823
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.940
Australia is like,
yeah,
we're not going to buy it.

824
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.800
My price thing with John Coogan just junk.

825
00:47:55.801 --> 00:47:59.410
Ooga it's not good enough,
mate.
We need something spicy.

826
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.350
I want you to name and after Miami changing in a until path.

827
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.770
We've seen guests from Miami,
they have big offices.
We like that.

828
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.900
Call it Miami.
Well Sal,
Mo,
terrible Australian accent.

829
00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.240
So I did my best.
I just don't want,
I want,

830
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.440
I only have a few Australian friends and you know,
hello.
Hi John.

831
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.930
Of the shrimp on the Barbie.
Oh,
by the way,

832
00:48:19.931 --> 00:48:23.560
my second show for Melbourne is almost sold out,

833
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:28.240
so you've got to fluoro thinking about going.
You fucks.
You better.

834
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:33.130
Act first one.
Sold out,
selling out over oceans.
Very close to selling out.

835
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:37.060
Nice.
I haven't been in Melbourne.
Never.
I'm so excited.

836
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.360
It's supposed to be like the San Francisco of Australia,

837
00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:45.460
like sophisticated and a very,
uh,
just rich and culture.

838
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:47.740
They supposedly have an amazing food scene.

839
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.130
Like the food in Melbourne is supposed to be spectacular.
I keep hearing that.

840
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.270
Saw an Anthony Bourdain episode about it too.

841
00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:55.930
We went there and sampled some of the quasi,

842
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.230
I've not watched enough of Anthony Bordain I used as best.

843
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.010
I love the shit out of that dude.
He's my boyfriend.
You love him?
He's great.
Yeah,

844
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.920
he's 58 years old.
The guy gets into Jujitsu,
just turns his blue belt.

845
00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:10.090
It's fantastic.
He's a junkie.
When he was younger,
like almost overdosed and died,

846
00:49:10.091 --> 00:49:12.530
smoked cigarettes until he had a kid.
Had the kids said,
you know what,

847
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:15.910
I've got to quit smoking cigarettes.
Had a kid like it was 50 you know,

848
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.720
I mean I just love him.
Great second bad motherfucker.
And it's also,

849
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:24.560
I liked the fact that he's a real artist,
like with food he made,

850
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.580
made me watching his show,
the no reservation show.

851
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.490
Maybe reconsider what food is not,
not,
you know,

852
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:34.720
I always appreciated food but I always said,
oh this guy,
this restaurant's great.

853
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:37.210
Like we used to go to great restaurants all the time and we'd be like,

854
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.400
oh I found this great Italian place.
We'd go have bottled wine.

855
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.330
Oh it's food's awesome.
But I didn't think about the food as art history.
Yes.

856
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.800
The creativity that goes into like change,

857
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.670
<v 1>turning it on its ear like I had to,
I had a,</v>

858
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.140
at this wedding I had some salmon and some steak and salmon.

859
00:49:52.141 --> 00:49:54.610
Steak is pretty standard and I,
and I had,

860
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:56.760
and I've been alive a long time and I hate that salmon,

861
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.590
that steak with a certain sauce on it.
And I stopped,
I stopped and I went,

862
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.190
all right,
hold on.
Something is going on here and,
and I'm,
I'm,

863
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.890
I'm having a little issue cause I've never had salmon like this.

864
00:50:10.891 --> 00:50:12.520
And for me to say I've never had sandwich,

865
00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:15.300
he'd beaten 1 million times or I've never had steak that tastes like this.

866
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.930
That's a big fucking deal.
Especially cause I really pay attention.

867
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:23.400
And I ran down there and I saw this cook with a ponytail,
kind of a skinny dude.

868
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.040
And I was like,
yeah,
what

869
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.040
<v 2>are you doing?
What happened?
He goes,
Oh,
do you like it?
I</v>

870
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.450
<v 0>said,
yeah,
I like it.
It's a little transcendent.
That's how I feel helped me.</v>

871
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:37.160
I'll get exaggerated.
I,
and even,
and,
and I said,
and correct me if I'm wrong sir,

872
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.230
but you cut small pieces here and you are taking into consideration the

873
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:47.231
relationship between the meat and you're crazy delicious Yam cake.

874
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.380
Yeah.
And you're,
and,

875
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.890
and this sauce that looks like it was made in heaven,

876
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.890
I've never seen green that you split,

877
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:02.000
you kind of spill just so it looked like kind of like,
oh,

878
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.530
it looks like fucking,

879
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.760
it looked like a fucking green pond that I could drink from.

880
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.240
Meanwhile,
he goes,
he looks at me.
He goes,
yes.
He said,

881
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.300
relationship is very important,
as is proportion.

882
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:18.080
Most people think they need to be quite a big piece,
but the minute you see it,

883
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:22.760
I go,
I finished the sentence.
I go,
I want more.
He goes,
exactly.

884
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:27.440
Here's why he's wrong,
because he's never had barbecue in Texas.
If he did,

885
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:30.380
he would want to eat until his fucking body wanted to explode.

886
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.470
I had a bunch of fixins.
I went to this place called blacks.

887
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.480
It was outside of a Austin.

888
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.960
It is the oldest barbecue place in Texas.

889
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.780
I put a picture of it up on my Instagram of the food,

890
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.660
me and Aubrey and my buddy Ben O'brien.

891
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.690
We had the most insane beef ribs I've ever eaten in my life.

892
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.640
Beef ribs are generally kind of chewing,
not these fucking things.

893
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:53.900
They cooked them for years.

894
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.820
They said they shot that cal in the 80s and they've been cooking up ever since.

895
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.220
Aubrey brought some into the office.
I think it was from blocks is the,

896
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.740
and he brought it from Frederick's,
which is another insane place in,

897
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:08.720
but that's in Austin.
See that on the left,

898
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:13.960
that piece of meat that was so fucking insanely tender and delicious,

899
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:19.400
that place it's a,
it's uh,
apparently it's a real landmark in Texas.
Blacks,

900
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:21.890
like everything else was really good.
Like the spare ribs were good,

901
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:25.070
the brisket was really good,
but God damn,
if you go there,

902
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:28.100
you got to fuck with those beef ribs.
They're insane.

903
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.160
Like we were all just blown away.
Like the three of us were like,

904
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:32.230
what the fuck on?

905
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:36.780
And we ain't until we almost exploded and it looks ridiculous.
Yeah.

906
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.510
I that that go go eat at blocks and then go to the honors academy and go have

907
00:52:41.511 --> 00:52:45.890
John Wolfe take you through one workout.
He's great dude.
He's great.
I was like,

908
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:48.980
Hey John,
what do you like?
First of all,
he's couldn't be thicker.
I was like,

909
00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:50.990
what are you,
what's your national very flexible.

910
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.920
He's ridiculously flexible with long arms.
He's like,
yeah,
I'm Japanese,

911
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:57.530
Mexican and English.
Interesting.
Very war.

912
00:52:57.531 --> 00:53:01.200
Like combination of people's very warlike,
sweetest guy ever law.

913
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.760
He's the last guy would ever called warlike know Swedish shit.

914
00:53:03.761 --> 00:53:07.430
And I can put you in a world of pain with no weights just using bodyweight.

915
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:11.630
Oh yeah.
He has a crazy hip complex series that he does,
which we did.
Yeah.
Oh,

916
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:15.380
it's amazing.
Right?
It's so weird.
Like you kept weird pain afterwards.

917
00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:17.570
You're like,
oh,
why does it inside of my Dick Hurting?

918
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:24.070
So true to do all this,
we're just going to take his,

919
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.500
just a mobility.
I was like,
all right,
well Aubrey and I were there,
um,

920
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.460
for my show.
I did a show at the Moody Theater.
She's insane.

921
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.090
Probably one of the best shows of my life.
It was amazing.
It's crazy.
God Damn.

922
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:40.770
I Love Austin,
Texas.
Fuck.
I love that place.
But,
uh,
we did this place,

923
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:41.850
this a moody theater,

924
00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:45.550
and before the theater we worked out at the Ana gym and then went to,
uh,

925
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:49.740
the zero gravity float spa or they have their perfect day.

926
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:53.940
But when we were there,
John was doing his,
uh,
certification seminars.

927
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.100
He does these,
uh,
honored certification seminars.

928
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:58.170
It shows these potential trainers,

929
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:01.410
people that want a career in the fitness industry shows him all sorts of

930
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:04.420
different ways to work out differently.
He's a scientist.
Oh yeah.

931
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:08.550
I was telling you about,
um,
the sky workout with Lou [inaudible],

932
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.560
who is a old school bodybuilder.
Strong man.
He's 68,
almost 59.

933
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:17.910
How's he look?
He looks fantastic.
He's,
he's,
he's,
uh,
originally from north Italy,

934
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.320
so he's got that Austrian,

935
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:23.450
like he's just got huge hands and a big kind of strong,
solid,
crazy.
Yeah,
he's,

936
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.250
but,
but when you say crazy,
like he's the guy,

937
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:30.270
I'll take you for 20 minutes and work you out and target your muscles in a

938
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:33.300
certain way and you're like,
this isn't doing,
I just feel like I could do more.

939
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.750
And then the next day you're sore shit.
Like he just,
he's a scientist.

940
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.280
He knows he's got 160 clients and it's because he just knows what the hell he's

941
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:43.950
doing.
And you're in and out in 20,
25 minutes.
Well,

942
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:48.240
if you could still look good in your sixties.
Oh,
he looks fantastic.
Ripped.

943
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:52.830
What's his Dick Taste like?
A,
I'm glad you asked.
We don't.

944
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:56.040
I don't do that and child I am.
I couldn't.
I was like,
I should ask that.

945
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.970
I always do.
That's all.
That's all I do.

946
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.600
That's all I do is such an idiot.

947
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.200
So what does he look like?

948
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.340
Like in his sixties pull a picture of this gentleman [inaudible] p p fit gym on

949
00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:14.960
a Lincoln.
If you guys want to go.

950
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.490
I'm always impressed with two tour in their sixties a little crazy.

951
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:21.510
He's 59 like a Steve Maxwell deep in his sixties.

952
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.650
[inaudible] 65 dude's a stud.
It's an animal.
He all he does.

953
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:30.300
It goes all over the world and trains people.
Just,
just little seminars.

954
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:34.860
What his philosophy.
He's a fascinating guy.

955
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.750
He has a lot of philosophies.
He's a very intelligent kind.

956
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.540
He's very well read when it comes to uh,

957
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.540
ancient methods of fitness and there is that kind of 60 years old.

958
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.790
He looks great.
I know he does though.
Parents amazing too.

959
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.440
It's better than Red van did.
I can't believe he was on that.
Yeah,

960
00:55:52.441 --> 00:55:56.400
he looks amazing,
Dude.
Yes.
Skin looks great.
Yup.
He's,
he's,

961
00:55:56.401 --> 00:56:00.090
he eats a lot of fruits and vegetables,
some meat.
He's working on that posture.

962
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:02.640
Then what's up with that neck?
Fourth thing it's got going on there,

963
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:06.390
straighten up fellow.
He's been working out in his whole life.
Worry about shit.

964
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.240
He can,
he can,
he can do shit to you and by the way,

965
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:13.110
that's exactly what he looks like right now and he can do shit to you that just,

966
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.610
he just targets those muscles.
So this is just,
he's given people a stair workout.

967
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.150
All he's doing here is warming you up.
You run,
you run maybe 10 stairs,

968
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:22.930
just a warm up,
you're not going to stretch before.

969
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:27.370
Warms the muscles up and then you just start slowly lifting and then by the time

970
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.030
20 minutes is over,
you're begging for money.
Yeah.

971
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.840
They say not to stretch now before lifting weights.

972
00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.770
Stretching actually can take away some of your performance.
Yeah.

973
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:41.160
The problem with that is I wonder if that's the case with martial arts because

974
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:42.050
I,

975
00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:47.050
I mean I think there's a reason why people in ballet and dance and gymnastics

976
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.540
stretch.
I don't know how to gymnastics,
I might've made that up,

977
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.760
but certainly dance,
they stretch before they work out.

978
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:58.150
They stretch before they practice.
Cause I think martial arts,

979
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:03.610
there's certain amount of flexibility that's necessary to achieve like that

980
00:57:03.611 --> 00:57:07.360
fluid motion.
Like if you're bound up and tense and tight,

981
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.610
you're not going to have the same sort of dexterity.

982
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.750
You're not going to have the same ability to place your foot wherever you want

983
00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:14.770
it to.
You're going to be,
there's going to be some resistance,

984
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:18.070
but that resistance might actually be okay if you're doing something like

985
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:20.920
squatting or jumping.
Right.
You know what I mean?

986
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:24.370
Like I think there's a different need that the body has when it comes to like,

987
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.250
I've always been like real skeptical people telling you not to stretch.

988
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.130
It was a way to scratch I think.
And I do agree.

989
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:33.820
I think it depends on the kind of movement you're doing and stuff,

990
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:36.640
but they say that the first thing you want to do is warm the muscle up.

991
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.290
But also overstretching.

992
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:42.060
Luckily a lot of yoga people develop arthritic conditions because the,

993
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:45.190
the tendons are genetically,
you know,

994
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:47.530
you either have longer tendons are shorter tenants.
So,

995
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:50.590
and I was like a hinge of a door.
Some people can only open their door this much.

996
00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:53.140
Other people went to open the door all the way.
Like you have very flexible,

997
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:58.150
you're really flexible.
And so when people overstretched those tenants,

998
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:02.640
what happens is if the tenant is shorter and you're trying to make it longer,

999
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.610
what will happen is the joint will start to compromise and you'll pull more of

1000
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:10.570
the joint apart.
Therefore you get water or,
or,
or air into that joint,

1001
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:12.820
which apparently is what creates an arthritic condition.

1002
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.930
So when you're constantly expanding and not doing some contractual work,

1003
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.210
that's where you're at.
So it's like yoga people,

1004
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:20.710
they're not lifting weights as well.

1005
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:24.460
Is that what it is after stretching too much?
And it does.
It doesn't,

1006
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:27.460
it does weaken the muscle when you're stretching.
Um,
you know,

1007
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:30.940
cold when you're cold and you're stretching and then you go and play soccer.

1008
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:35.350
A lot of girls especially were tearing their ACL and then when they had them

1009
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:40.060
start changing the way they trained,
uh,
more weightlifting,
more,
um,

1010
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.460
more warming than muscle up beforehand.

1011
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:46.720
That's how they were avoiding more of those ACL tears.
That's fascinating.
Yeah,

1012
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:51.280
it's,
it's,
it's interesting how they learn.
You do thank you.
Keep going.

1013
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:53.140
It's interesting how they learn too.

1014
00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:55.940
It's like they almost have to like watch people fuck up and go,
Whoa,

1015
00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.410
what's he doing wrong?
Like why is he getting injured?
You know,

1016
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:02.260
one of the things Maxwell I feel about everything in life.
Sure.

1017
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.630
Like the next time we go into a war,
like I was talking about,

1018
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:10.180
I hope that we learn and we go,
what's the history of the region?
I mean we may,

1019
00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:11.950
you learn by mistakes you learned the hard way.

1020
00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:15.700
Well you should listen to Dan Carlin's series on world war one.

1021
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.040
Have you heard of?
I have.

1022
00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:20.080
And I remember when he was talking about the difference between the World War

1023
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:24.050
One and the previous wars and that like they had,

1024
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:29.170
they had all these ideas about war chivalry honor standing up and shit went

1025
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:32.870
away.
I had no right,
well give cause cause with a machine gun you,
you all die.

1026
00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:37.520
Yeah.
Well not only that,
they started introducing things like bomb gas.
Yeah.

1027
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:41.680
Fritz harbor while Fritz Haber was a fascinating character because you know that

1028
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.070
most fascinating.
Yeah.

1029
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:45.740
Because he learned how he figured out a way to take nitrogen out of the air,

1030
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:49.240
create ammonia.
This is from radio lab and uh,

1031
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:54.110
that ammonia is what they think that half the population of the world today has

1032
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:56.870
Fritz harbor nitrogen in their bloodstream.

1033
00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:01.980
The reason we can feed 7 billion people in soon 10 billion is primarily because

1034
01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:03.770
of the process for its hopper invented,

1035
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:07.130
which is getting nitrogen out of the air and into the soil,

1036
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:08.810
which is how you create fertilizer.

1037
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.140
Problem is it's also how you create explosives and poison gas,

1038
01:00:14.151 --> 01:00:16.520
if you will.
He was the first one to figure that out.

1039
01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:19.520
How to use poison gas on troops,
chlorine gas.

1040
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:24.550
So while he was being awarded Nobel Prize of Science for creating the hopper

1041
01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.020
method,
he was also being wanted for war crimes by the United States.

1042
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.140
Like gassing people.
Yes.
And the way they died,

1043
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.340
apparently if you listen to the radio lab podcasts,

1044
01:00:35.341 --> 01:00:38.360
they drown in their own phlegm.
Well,
how about what they,
what they do,

1045
01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:43.160
how they end it,
which is he created an insecticide called [inaudible] a,

1046
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.540
which is an insecticide.
And the reason it has is that client A's,

1047
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:50.690
because it has a certain smell to it,
you put an,
you put a scent in it,

1048
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.500
so you know when it's in the air to avoid that area,
uh,

1049
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:57.170
the way they do with gasoline,
gasoline doesn't have that scent.

1050
01:00:57.171 --> 01:01:01.070
They put that scent in there.
Um,
that's an artificial sense.
So you know,

1051
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:04.370
if there's a gas leak and the same as icon a,

1052
01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.820
when the Nazis were figuring out what to do with their quote unquote Jewish

1053
01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:11.560
problem,
and they talked about the final solution,
they said,
let's,

1054
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:16.580
let's use this xy clon a and take the scent out.

1055
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.510
It'll be xy.
Clon B and the irony is for its harbor,

1056
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:24.620
who was the secular Jew who,
who was a patriot,
a German patriot,

1057
01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:27.200
have figured out a way to have feed half the world.

1058
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.620
His tos technology ended up killing his extended family and his friends.

1059
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.670
It's Kinda crazy man.

1060
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:39.140
He actually wound up leaving Germany and he was ostracized by the rest of the

1061
01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:43.430
world.
It's a fascinating at hot dust.
It's called the bad podcast.

1062
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.540
It's one of the radio lab ones.
It was amazing.

1063
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.380
It was a great one that got out now about elements about this woman who was

1064
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:55.610
going crazy and a lithium was the only thing that uh,
she's bipolar.

1065
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.090
Lithium brings her way back tomorrow and we'll,
lithium is just an element.

1066
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.460
It's assault.
Apparently.
I didn't know that he was upset,

1067
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.350
some sort of of that you need to listen.
Does he listen to crisper?
But this,

1068
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:10.940
this lithium thing that uh,
she's taking is killing her.
It's killing her.

1069
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:13.640
It's causing your kidneys to fail.
So she has to get off the lithium.

1070
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:16.820
And so they're talking to her while this was going on in the podcast.

1071
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.650
He's saying like this is so complicated from,

1072
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.020
because this is one thing that's killing me,
but it's also allowing me to be me.

1073
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.820
Really,
really fascinating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The crisper,

1074
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.630
we've talked about it a few times on this podcast.

1075
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.490
The ability to manipulate genes and this is the beginning Crispr,

1076
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.540
if you've never heard that one,
that's another great one.

1077
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.690
Radio lab is the Shit fucking amazing podcasts.
So interesting.
You know,

1078
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.140
so many fascinating,

1079
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:42.840
fascinating subjects that cover what would you do if they committed,

1080
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:44.640
manipulate your genes,
what do you want different?

1081
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.630
It's gotta be a real problem when people do do it because there's going to be,

1082
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.910
there's going to be no regular people left.

1083
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I think we're looking at life now as if you go back to the early forms of life

1084
01:02:58.501 --> 01:02:59.334
that we're on this planet,

1085
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.250
just single celled organisms turned into multi-celled organisms.

1086
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:06.050
They evolve from random mutations and you know,
natural selection,

1087
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.570
all the different various factors that cause a person to come out of the

1088
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.400
primordial slime that we originated from.
If you look at what we are now,

1089
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:17.700
we look at all that is like this.
This is like how it progresses.
You know,

1090
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.930
this is how a dinosaur it turns into a bird and this is all we can see.

1091
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.030
These are the really pry evolution.
And you know,

1092
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:27.390
most of the Republican candidates don't want to talk about that.
This is crazy.

1093
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:31.470
If you look at all that stuff,
we look at this timeline,
it's this long,

1094
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.990
slow,
crazy timeline.
It's,

1095
01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.490
it's really difficult to trace for the average human mind.
You know,

1096
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:41.780
you look it up a primate and you look at a human,
you go,
well,

1097
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:46.730
human used to be something like that a long time ago.
What?
Fuck.
And you know,

1098
01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:48.810
and he would see pictures of cave people kind of get it.

1099
01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:52.520
But that's 60,000 years ago.
We said,
well now a hundred thousand years ago,

1100
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:56.370
million years ago,
whatever the fuck it was,
it seemed so long.
It's hard.

1101
01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:59.810
It doesn't really register.
It's like when someone says $1 trillion,
so like,
um,

1102
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.880
okay,
a trillion years,
I don't get it.
Right.

1103
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:05.970
You know that it's going to happen like that.

1104
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:09.880
There's going to come on roll our own evolution on g.
Yes.

1105
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.650
And I think it's only one part of the bigger problem.

1106
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:18.950
I think our ability to control our own bodies is just a part of the evolution of

1107
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:23.910
technology and the evolution of technology that allows us to do that is also

1108
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:27.690
going to create artificial life,
which is many,
many more times complicated.

1109
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.840
Well it takes the element of chance out of the entire equation.

1110
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.320
So when we're able to control exactly how we look and what we develop into and

1111
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:41.520
what we are resistant to,
it's kind like what we're doing with crops.

1112
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.200
And I think I also,
I feel like we are us,

1113
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:48.840
we are going to be able to take this machine,
which is what we are,

1114
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:53.070
which is kind of a fascinating and incredibly complex machine,

1115
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:58.071
but technology is going to render this machine kind of obsolete.

1116
01:04:59.071 --> 01:04:59.701
I feel like,

1117
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:04.440
I feel like ultimately we're going to trade in this machine for uh,

1118
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:08.970
something that works a lot more efficiently and it's more and lives longer and

1119
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.160
all that stuff.
If you could do it,
why not?
Yeah,

1120
01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:15.600
but that's even assuming that what we are is going to maintain.

1121
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.000
I don't think.
I think we are technological

1122
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 2>caterpillar.
That's what I think.</v>

1123
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:24.070
I think we're a caterpillar that becomes a butterfly and right now we're in the

1124
01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:26.770
middle of making of cocoon.
That's really interesting.

1125
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:30.730
I just don't say [inaudible] you mean mentally?
I think life.

1126
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:35.590
I think if we create artificial life we create some sort of an artificial thing

1127
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.020
that somehow or another profits on it staying alive.

1128
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.660
Like there's a reason why we want to stay alive.
We want to procreate,

1129
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.070
we're going to keep the human race alive and we want to react to all of our

1130
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:45.611
instincts,

1131
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:49.690
all of our natural instincts and the natural reward systems that have been put

1132
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:53.050
in place over the eons to make sure that we keep breathing and keep staying

1133
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:54.910
alive.
That's where your ego comes from.

1134
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:57.700
That's where lust comes from and greed and jealousy.

1135
01:05:57.701 --> 01:06:02.020
All these things are like they're motivating factors for you to improve on your,

1136
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:06.460
your condition and and and keep fucking and keep making more babies.

1137
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.800
Why are they covering thy neighbor's wife?
Why?

1138
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:11.710
Cause he want to fuck that bitch and shoot some loads into her and make a baby

1139
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:13.360
with her.
I've got to make babies.
You got to keep going.

1140
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:17.650
I think that's a really shitty design and I think it ultimately,

1141
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.680
it's main goal is to for it for the biological entity to create a more

1142
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:27.850
sophisticated and much more efficient entity.
And that's what it's going to do.

1143
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.660
There's a,
this is the caterpillar and this caterpillar is going to become some

1144
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:33.220
indescribable butterfly,

1145
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:37.540
some butterfly that can manipulate its environment like never before.

1146
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.980
Some butterfly that literally creates worlds.
If you,
well,
if you,

1147
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:46.860
if you extrapolate that and if you then say,
look,
I have,
um,

1148
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.710
all my biological needs are taken care of so I don't have to worry about
disease.

1149
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:54.580
I don't have to worry about food.
Um,
and I'm optimal.
I'm,

1150
01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:59.440
I'm at my optimal,
my machine can,
can adapt and it probably won't die.

1151
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.690
You're still left with something that's very interesting to me,
which is now.
Now,

1152
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.810
if you've taken out the equation that sort of rudimentary need to procreate,

1153
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:11.650
that rudimentary needs to replicate yourself,
that rudimentary need to sort of,

1154
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:16.120
or rudimentary,
it might be the wrong word,
but,
but the need to,
to be immortal,

1155
01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:20.140
to keep your genes through whatever it is going.

1156
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.640
Then you're kind of left with why yourself and why.

1157
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:27.010
You know like what am I doing pleasure,

1158
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.460
but what is all know pleasure is different.
I think what you're getting,
but what?

1159
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.720
Positive experiences,
right?
Fun,
excitement,
pleasure.

1160
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:37.390
What end positive to know yourself better.
What are those things?

1161
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.900
The question is what are those things?
What is positive?
What is,
what is love?

1162
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.350
What is happiness?
What is friendship?
What does achievement?

1163
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:48.640
All those things are the rewards.
All those things are rewards for behavior.

1164
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:53.260
That's ultimately going to lead to procreation.
Bonding leads to community.

1165
01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:56.740
Community leads to safety,
safety leads to your children's surviving.

1166
01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:59.260
All those things are connected.
Yes.
Procreation,

1167
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.340
acquiring of things becoming more more valuable as a a member of your community

1168
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:11.410
and more desirable as a possible breeding candidate.
All those things,

1169
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:15.160
they're,
they're all,
they all contribute to ultimately to procreation.

1170
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:16.010
That's like a

1171
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.160
<v 0>big part of what everything that we do is,</v>

1172
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:21.470
but then there's another side which is play.

1173
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.650
You could define as that what you do for the sake of doing.
Right,
right.

1174
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:28.970
And that's probably when you're most yourself.
So if,
if play is the case,

1175
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.550
then it seems like we were just talking about this.
Like people say,

1176
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:33.890
I don't know what to do with my life.
And I always say the younger people,

1177
01:08:33.891 --> 01:08:35.990
I'm like,
look man,
I don't know what to do with your life either.

1178
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:39.950
But I do know that it's really fun to get good at a language like watching you

1179
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:42.810
play pool.
That's a language that something you've closed,
you,
you've,

1180
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:46.040
you've come very close to being as really,

1181
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.560
really good at and you have a deep understanding of it.

1182
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:53.420
There's a d you gain a deep understanding this great pleasure in being fluent in

1183
01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:57.830
a language like say pool or Jujitsu or boxing or even another language or,

1184
01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.870
or in an instrument like guitar.

1185
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:04.460
I think you develop an understanding and sometimes that's that you can't

1186
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:07.580
necessarily put into words.
It's something you have to experience.

1187
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.490
But God damn it is,
it's satisfying.
It's satisfying in of itself.

1188
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.690
But why?
Well,
well,
okay,
so here's my answer.
I think,
well,

1189
01:09:17.691 --> 01:09:18.381
I don't have the answer,

1190
01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:23.381
but I think it may lie in the area of understanding and coming closer to

1191
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.800
something maybe people call consciousness,
uh,

1192
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:33.440
coming closer to something that's bigger than yourself,

1193
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.380
communion with,
uh,
something that is,
uh,
without measure,

1194
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.180
but that,
you know,
is there,

1195
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.290
don't you think though also that if you don't look at it like in some sort of

1196
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.220
spiritual way,

1197
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.260
but look at in terms of just biology and natural reward systems that are put

1198
01:09:51.261 --> 01:09:54.260
into place by success,
success leading to procreation,

1199
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.750
people that are really good at things,
you'd get good at,

1200
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:57.980
things that are difficult to solve.

1201
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.910
Like solving puzzles is integral to survival.

1202
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:05.450
That's integral to innovation leads to more efficiency,

1203
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.530
more efficiency leads to more food,
more food leads to people staying alive.

1204
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:13.880
The better you get at something,
the more you're rewarded with the,

1205
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:15.410
the those positive feelings,

1206
01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:19.490
those natural ward systems that are put in place to make sure that people figure

1207
01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:21.260
out their fucking part on this world.

1208
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:26.470
Figure out their way through this life until they can invent artificial life,

1209
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:30.530
get them hooked on material possessions,

1210
01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:34.940
get them hooked on this idea of getting the newest,
greatest,
latest shit.

1211
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.100
Get them hooked on technology.

1212
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.310
You need a watch that you can swipe and you need all these different new crazy

1213
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:43.580
ants.
And the more these things get fueled,
the more,

1214
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:47.750
the more the technology grows,
the more the technology grows,

1215
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:52.730
the more the inevitability of an artificial life form exists.

1216
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.750
Okay?
But,
but here's,
here's why.
Here's what I'm so blown away right now.

1217
01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.000
Meet you man.
But here,
take your pants off for a second.
Here's a camera,
right?

1218
01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:06.860
Oh boy.
Shit.
Here's where I trip trip.
Sorry,
I'm 48 trip.
You know,
shots.

1219
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:10.800
Um,
here's,
here's what,
uh,
what I,

1220
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.400
I think though,
so when you talk about technology,

1221
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.210
<v 1>most of us are talking about a tool you can use for the here and now.
Um,
and,</v>

1222
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:23.211
and that technology allows you to speak to people more clearly in faster and get

1223
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:26.040
places faster and all that stuff.
They're all tools,

1224
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:31.010
but then there's another side to fucking reality that I'm fascinated with and,

1225
01:11:31.011 --> 01:11:32.400
and I don't know why it's there,

1226
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.720
but there's something that goes beyond experience.
Uh,

1227
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:39.120
there's a reality that is beyond experience.
And you know what I mean by that?

1228
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:41.070
I'll tell you the number.

1229
01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:44.310
Infinity is not something we'll ever see,

1230
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:49.300
but it's something we imagine and something we use in mathematics.
Um,

1231
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.730
negative numbers,

1232
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.760
negative integers and things are mathematical constructs that you can't actually

1233
01:11:55.950 --> 01:12:00.390
see and don't have material measurement necessarily,

1234
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:04.800
but they are theoretical and we use them and benefit from it.

1235
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:09.390
Here's another great example.
The mathematician in 1860,

1236
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.810
who spends his whole life thinking of some weird mathematical equation.

1237
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:18.570
It's got no bearing on a material world whatsoever until 150 years later.

1238
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:23.700
And now we're using it to measure the difference between fucking,
you know,

1239
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:27.120
the crater on Mars and how it relates to things like that.

1240
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:31.590
And I just think that sometimes whatever human beings have an imagination,

1241
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:34.380
it's put there,
the imagination has put there somewhere.

1242
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.500
And I'm not getting into this mystical stuff.
I'm just saying,

1243
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.330
I am curious to know why,
why we have,

1244
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.540
what separates us from animals is potential is,

1245
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:50.570
is anything we can imagine seems to be within our reach in terms of reality.

1246
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.230
And I eventually,
yes and I think,

1247
01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.380
I think that nostalgia that need to go physically further than we've ever gone

1248
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:05.040
before and and mentally for them,
we've ever gone before.

1249
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:07.720
W there is no limit to human potential there.

1250
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:12.180
It seems to be zero limit to him and potential to the point where we will render

1251
01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:13.460
ourselves out.

1252
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:18.480
We're very biology and even our mental paradigms obsolete where we will achieve

1253
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.100
in.
But wait a minute,
will we be Wieden?
Exactly.

1254
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.630
Won't will be something better.
That's what I mean.
What we'll do,
we evolve.

1255
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.760
So you're essentially agreeing with me.
We're going to create them.

1256
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.200
How we going to create an artificial life form?
Well,

1257
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:35.820
that artist's life form might be the butterfly,
right?
Yes.
If we,

1258
01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:39.250
if we need absolutely to constantly innovate and we do,

1259
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.610
no one is ever going to look at a computer and say,
we're done.

1260
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.480
No one's going to look at an iPhone se there's no need for the six s the six is

1261
01:13:45.481 --> 01:13:49.890
perfect.
Let's stop there.
Who Needs 12 megapixels?
I got eight.
I'm happy as fuck.

1262
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.190
I take great Instagram pictures.
No,
no one's going to be happy.

1263
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:55.160
We're going to get bored.
And it's a part,
it's,

1264
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.540
it's an inexorable part of being a human.

1265
01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.790
There's this weird thing you can't take out of us.
Where we look with,

1266
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.770
with all as the guy who decides to live in a log house and go fishing every day

1267
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.810
is the guy lives off the land.
What?

1268
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:10.560
Like there's so freaky that we have TV shows dedicated to them.
Yes.

1269
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.980
Like let's watch these people

1270
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.880
<v 2>in Alaska walking anachronisms those are,
those are like throwbacks,
right?
I mean,</v>

1271
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.660
that's what's interesting is that there they're bucking the grid and saying,

1272
01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:21.800
I can still do it the way we did 150 years.

1273
01:14:21.801 --> 01:14:25.510
There's that and there's also the fact that they're out there braving the wild,

1274
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.490
they're braving the atmosphere there,

1275
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:30.960
braving the harsh parts of the world that we don't want to visit like too,

1276
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.850
like that's all the thing about life below zero that show that I love.
Yeah,

1277
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
it's 200 fucking miles above the arctic circle is where these people live.

1278
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:42.760
Some of them,
you know what I mean?
Just fuck man.
Sue Akins,

1279
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:45.310
a chick that I had on the show,
she's amazing.

1280
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.670
If you've never listened to that podcast,
it's one of the best ones I ever did.

1281
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:52.750
Bailey.
Oh my God.
It's a fascinating woman,
man.
She's in her fifties,

1282
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:56.530
lives up in Alaska by herself in this fucking,

1283
01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.340
you can't even have buildings up there because it's,
it's,

1284
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.940
it's on this land that has to have temporary structures because of whatever

1285
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:08.470
goofy fucking law there's in place.
So she has tents.
They're these giant tents.

1286
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:13.330
We'd like w wires and you know,
very thick canvas.
But they're fucking tense man.

1287
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.930
And she's out there with grizzly bears and wolves and she,
everywhere she goes,

1288
01:15:16.931 --> 01:15:19.810
she's strapped.
She got attacked by a bear.

1289
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.420
Fucking bitter head broke her hip,
fucked her up.
She went to the hospital.
I mean,

1290
01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:29.950
she was a fucking,
uh,
honor back for like seven days before they found her.

1291
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:32.230
She went to the hospital,
got fixed up,
went back,

1292
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.300
shot the fucking bear and ate it.

1293
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.520
She's the most gangster bitch on the planet.
It does.

1294
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.100
She's like right up there with Ronda Rousey.
She's so gangs.
Just Rhonda.

1295
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:46.870
If she's 50.
Hey,
this chick chick is hard fucking Corp.

1296
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.890
Fascinating though.
Like that this woman chooses to,

1297
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:52.720
that's where she's getting her jollies.
There's her,
that's how I love that lady.

1298
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.170
That's she's her house,
man.
That's her fucking house.
That's where she lives.

1299
01:15:56.171 --> 01:15:59.470
He's got like a wooden side.
The top of that is all cloth.
It's a tent.

1300
01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:01.690
He lives up there alone.
Yes,
and she got up.

1301
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.690
She occasionally has visitors and now she travels.

1302
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:07.630
She has children and grandchildren.
She does whatever the fuck she wants.

1303
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.000
But that's what those things look like.
They're,
they're,
they're,

1304
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.530
they're temporary structures.

1305
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:16.950
She gets her gas flowing in and these gigantic planes and she fills a planes up.

1306
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:18.040
She's like a waypoint.

1307
01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:20.920
She owns like a filling station up there and that's how she makes her living.

1308
01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:25.420
And she also,
um,
people can come stay in like she has structures up there.

1309
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:28.480
They can come stay in Caribou Hunt and do a bunch of different things and she'll

1310
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:33.100
take people on like guided tours of the area.
Now it's especially look at that.

1311
01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:36.280
There's the,
uh,
the place where she lives.
What's that?
That's amazing.
Oh,

1312
01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:39.460
it's so amazing.
She's,
she's incredible.
But it's,

1313
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.960
she's not just dealing with the,
the environment.

1314
01:16:43.961 --> 01:16:48.730
She's dealing with the animals.
She's dealing with mortality and you know,

1315
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:51.820
she's Liz's subsistence lifestyle up there.
Most of what she gets,

1316
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:54.580
either she gets flown in or she shoots it and eats it.

1317
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.770
Go Scroll back up to the top.
There was those,

1318
01:16:56.830 --> 01:17:01.090
who are those people that they loved it too.
Oh yeah.
Cc she provides like this,

1319
01:17:01.091 --> 01:17:05.590
it says hunting and fishing.
No,
those are Caribou.
Those are Caribou antlers.

1320
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:08.230
They have these crazy antlers.
So those are actually reindeer.

1321
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.660
I mean that's what a rain here is.

1322
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.670
<v 0>So the relative of the reindeer,
like pretty similar.</v>

1323
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.310
So kabak where she's at,
she has these,

1324
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:20.990
a hunting camps to come up there because these people see you have to,

1325
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.300
you have self guided camps.
She just,

1326
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:26.660
the Caribou are up there and they go by every year.

1327
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:29.660
There's like a time when they go up there,
it was like August or some shit.

1328
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.130
And during that time that's when they fly people up there and they go caribou

1329
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:37.850
hunting.
But they'll,
they'll walk by and these massive herds,

1330
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.230
hundreds and hundreds of Caribou sometimes and he'd just lay down,

1331
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:46.070
you pick one and you shoot it and you eat it and you get hundreds of pounds of

1332
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:49.100
the most delicious meat you'll every in your life.
That's,

1333
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.810
that's a moose actually.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a different animal.
But that's a,

1334
01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:57.830
that's the most too.
But the other one,
we're a Caribou and they're,

1335
01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:02.760
they're unbelievably delicious too.
So our Moose man,
I had some Moose Sirloin.

1336
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.580
Neither did I cooked from last year when I shot that Moose last year,

1337
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.470
I cooked it the other day.
The vegan?
No,

1338
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.610
the food is that meat is so good like you,
if you ate it at a restaurant,

1339
01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:15.800
it'd be like your favorite meat ever,
but they can't.

1340
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:19.340
You don't sell Moose commercial and still haven't gotten any from me.
Dude.

1341
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:22.760
Come over man.
When he come over,
come over.
It's quick.
Maybe I'll do it today.

1342
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.840
Come on we cryo.
Let's do it.
Come on over.
I'll class Tim Kennedy.

1343
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:29.690
I was watching talking to mass.
He was cryotherapy.
I said,

1344
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:34.070
do you shiver?
And he said,
I do.
Well with the cold

1345
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:39.110
fucking stud.
You get very excited about him.
Yes.
He's my boyfriend,

1346
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.480
Anthony Bordain jurists and Tim Kennedy's mind.

1347
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:45.890
I fantasize about just being buddies.
What would you guys do together?

1348
01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.340
Hunt wild boar on horseback with spears.
Duh.

1349
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.650
It sounds like an effective way to shoot guns and then could you have guns and

1350
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.440
watch action films?
Why don't you just shoot the boar with guns if you have guns?

1351
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:01.110
Because spears are more macho and got to,

1352
01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:04.340
you got to have good throwing motion.
Yeah.

1353
01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:08.120
I've thought that about bow hunting.
Why?
Why bow hunt?

1354
01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.850
Why do you have to bow hunt?
Because it's more of a challenge I guess,

1355
01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:14.900
but the idea of challenges to kind of dangerous or you're hunting I guess,

1356
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:16.910
and also for the animal.
A lot of wounded.

1357
01:19:16.911 --> 01:19:20.650
I've been watching a lot of hunting shows where they show wounded animals with

1358
01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.740
tired of,
do you think like once the mystery of something goes away,

1359
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:29.090
you you want to move on?
I'm like,
what is it about archery?
Oh,

1360
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:32.650
archery is a great discipline.
I love archery as a discipline.
Yeah.

1361
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:34.280
It's a fun thing to do.

1362
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.160
Like just shooting targets come over the house and I will fucking shoot some

1363
01:19:37.161 --> 01:19:40.220
targets today.
I'll have to get one of my little girl bows out for you to use,

1364
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:43.730
but I need a 60 pound the nineties too hard for me.
I don't use the 90 anymore.

1365
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:48.230
I use a 70 I think I can pull back a 70 could ne you might struggle.

1366
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.980
You had a hard time with the 80 last time.
Yeah.
Um,
but um,

1367
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:55.580
it's hard man.
It's,
it's also something you shouldn't,
shouldn't start out with.

1368
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.280
Just start out with like a 40 to 50.
Yeah.

1369
01:19:58.281 --> 01:20:02.510
Just get used to the motion and also get used to the fundamentals of archery.

1370
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:05.330
You don't want to be struggling with the bow while you are learning how to do
it.

1371
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.010
I take creatine now.
Do I do make

1372
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.990
<v 2>you bigger?
It makes your face fat.
I'm a thinker.
I'm carrying water weight.</v>

1373
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.910
You guys make sure Facebook like I'm on my period.
Um,
but it's,

1374
01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.200
it's just a fun thing to do.
Like a luck lining up to target,

1375
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:20.760
keeping everything straight straight.

1376
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:24.810
And there's something that when you're doing something that's really difficult,

1377
01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:27.300
like it's hard to get the Arrow to go where you want it to go.

1378
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.020
It takes a lot of practice.
I shoot about a hundred hours a day every day.

1379
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.720
I have archery targets all over my yard.

1380
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.890
I have like five of them,
six of them in one side.

1381
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.460
I just ordered a giant elk.
It hasn't gotten here yet,
but it's fucking huge.

1382
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.910
Rubber elk sounds like set up somewhere they should be for me.

1383
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.100
There are shy and don't want to do,
what do I do?

1384
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:51.210
A giant who's this giant rubber elk for?
It's Joe Rogan.
Ah,
yeah,

1385
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.750
he's got a rubber pig as well.
A very popular,
a lot of people have them,

1386
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:58.410
the giant rubber elk that hunt with bow hunting with El cause you want to make

1387
01:20:58.411 --> 01:21:00.570
sure that you're going to hit that spot.
You want to,

1388
01:21:00.571 --> 01:21:04.350
and that's looking at an animal is different than looking at a target,
you know,

1389
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:08.610
and some like a lot of what archery is is repetition,

1390
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.410
repetition and muscle memory.

1391
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.870
And it's got to like be ingrained in your mind how you line a shot up and what,

1392
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.030
what,
what are the movements when you release that Arrow.

1393
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:21.330
See I love all that stuff.
Yeah,
that's great.
I just like,
that's why like,

1394
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.710
you know,
boxing,

1395
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:27.200
I like working out with somebody like at box and burn this Guy Chris Man Aaron

1396
01:21:27.201 --> 01:21:31.170
and his fight and for the IB,
uh Oh,
or Ibo title,

1397
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:35.520
he's defending his international title on Spike TV.
What is it?
Uh,
anyway.

1398
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:39.390
Um,
and he like just learning how like,

1399
01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:41.640
just like the intricacies of boxing.

1400
01:21:41.641 --> 01:21:43.920
I know I'm never going to master it or get really good at it,

1401
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.820
but I just like reaching,
I like just reaching its,
if you think about it,

1402
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.010
48 years old,
it's silver.
Well what's going to happen?

1403
01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:52.170
I'm going to be thrown into it when the Mongols come,

1404
01:21:52.171 --> 01:21:54.630
they're going to throw me into a pit.
I,
you'd have to bucks that guy.

1405
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:57.300
Let's bet on him and all of a sudden going to surprise everybody with my fucking

1406
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.050
by Jab,
pop,
pop,
pop,
and then it'd be like Brad Pitt and that movie snack.

1407
01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.230
That's all I want to be.
I just want to be a gypsy fighter with that body.

1408
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:05.990
You want to talk like that to you guys?

1409
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:13.530
I know.
Uh,

1410
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:17.820
yeah man.
Getting good at things is fun.
I mean,
but you know,

1411
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.640
the ultimate question like we were talking about before,
it's like,
why is it fun?

1412
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.200
Like what is it about it?
I don't know,

1413
01:22:22.201 --> 01:22:27.000
but I just know that for me to stay happy and this is my own craziness,

1414
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:31.230
I need to constantly be engaged in things that challenged me.
That's it.

1415
01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.150
I've tried a bunch of other ways to be happy.

1416
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.440
I can't just chill out and relax all the time.
It's just not in me.
Me Neither.

1417
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:41.160
I'm that.
I like to relax.
Like I do love relaxation,

1418
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:43.110
but I have to feel like I've earned it.

1419
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:46.740
I don't like relax like regular laziness,

1420
01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:51.510
like waking and baking and getting up.
That leaves me with this hollow anxiety,

1421
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.230
like I can't do that.
I've tried it.
I've tried to just be lazy.

1422
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.110
It fucks with my head too much gray.

1423
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.230
I can only appreciate watching television or going to the movies if I've done my

1424
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:04.230
work,
if I haven't done my work,
I don't,
you know,

1425
01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:08.920
and there's in achievement too,
there's happiness and getting shit done.
Yeah,

1426
01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:09.810
but that's also the house.

1427
01:23:09.811 --> 01:23:12.880
It goes back to what we were talking about where like I'm trying to work on this

1428
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.020
new hour now.
Now I shot my one hour editing it and I'm throwing all that away.

1429
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:19.960
And you've got to start with new stuff.
What drives me,

1430
01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:23.950
actually I swear to God is not laughs I've had enough.
You know,

1431
01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:26.860
you can get inoculated to that.
It's a beautiful thing to get a lot of laughs.

1432
01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:30.520
But what was more important is I want to see what else I can come home with.

1433
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:34.090
I want to see if I can tap into my real potential and come up with something

1434
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:38.800
even better.
That challenge is again going,
what is my potential?

1435
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:39.191
Like what,

1436
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:42.430
what am I really having me and how much time if I spend like eight hours a day

1437
01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:45.880
thinking about as opposed to two hours a day.
Well that's,
that's what nags at me.

1438
01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:49.060
It's also you realize as you know an artist,

1439
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:51.040
men as an artist,

1440
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:54.370
you're constantly growing and you're constantly getting nuts.

1441
01:23:54.371 --> 01:23:58.540
One of the number one problems with older comedians that have the act from 20

1442
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:00.640
years ago,
we've seen those guys before.

1443
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:05.710
Time passes you by comedy is like a sand castle.

1444
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:09.790
You build it.
I mean people can look at the photos of it from the,
from the past,

1445
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:13.900
but this shit's gone.
It's gone.
And once it's gone,
it's gone.

1446
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:18.010
Like if Lenny Bruce came back from the dead today and went up Saturday night at

1447
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.500
the comedy store,
he,
you know,
plate of Dick's,
he die.

1448
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:24.580
He would cause the co the culture has changed if you go and listen to his,

1449
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.710
and I'm not a hater at all.
I mean,

1450
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.980
I think Lenny Bruce is the most important figure in all of standup.

1451
01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.520
He's the original.
He's the Godfather.
You over my house.
I've Lenny Bruce posters.

1452
01:24:36.521 --> 01:24:39.620
I have a concert poster from the Fillmore.
I have,
uh,

1453
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.020
one of his concert movies that's framed in a poster to me.

1454
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:46.060
He's like,
that was the original.

1455
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:50.290
He fucking took a lot of crazy chances and got arrested for it and really

1456
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:55.291
ultimately went crazy the last parts of his life where him going to court doing

1457
01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:59.410
heroin died on his fucking bathroom floor doing heroin.

1458
01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:03.240
Just he was going to court all the time and he would do shows where he was just

1459
01:25:03.241 --> 01:25:07.390
completely gone.
He would just read legal transcripts to the audience.
There's,

1460
01:25:07.391 --> 01:25:09.730
there's,
there's video of it.
Yeah,
you can watch it.

1461
01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:13.360
I bought a bunch of these videos and watch them with VHS was like,
wow,

1462
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:17.470
this guy just went crazy.
But at the end he was just going through so dig,

1463
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.730
the judge says,
and he's like,
like reading these transcripts with no comedy.

1464
01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.320
There was nothing funny about it.

1465
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:27.250
He just lost all of his point and was obsessed with this.

1466
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.770
So he laid the foundation.

1467
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.330
He laid the groundwork that for guys like you and me and everybody else,

1468
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:38.830
everybody else that does stand out,
but one work today,
if you're the same act,

1469
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:42.700
if he was alive today,
he'd figure it out.
He'd figured out,
you know,
he's a comic.

1470
01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:47.380
He'd figure it out,
but he'd have to grow.
Like everyone has to grow your,
your,

1471
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:50.890
your comedy grows and it changes as the culture changes.
There's,

1472
01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:52.960
if you go back to like Eddie Murphy Raw,

1473
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:57.550
there's some fucking terrible homophobic shit.
Eddie Murphy Raw.
I was there.

1474
01:25:57.551 --> 01:25:59.470
I went to his car.
I went to the actual concert.

1475
01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:02.640
But did you think it was terrible and homophobic at that time?
Not that,
no.

1476
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:07.040
It was okay.
It was acceptable.
And that was when I wasn't,

1477
01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:10.400
I've never been a,
you know,
I've always been sensitive to people's feelings.

1478
01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:12.770
I was never wanting to gang up on something.
He was gay,

1479
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:16.550
but I just didn't think of it as something that was bad.
Oh,
speaking of which,

1480
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:19.450
I forgot to bring this up.
I wanted to,
um,
uh,

1481
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:23.900
Jamie go to my Twitter page and there's a tweet that I posted today about this

1482
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:27.500
woman from Kentucky that is the Kentucky clerk.

1483
01:26:27.501 --> 01:26:30.410
Denies Marriage license under God's authority.

1484
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.010
There's a video of these guys.
Did you see the video?
These guys,

1485
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.550
this is a new one.
This is from today.
This is a new person.

1486
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.040
Like there was the other person.
This is a new person.

1487
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:44.630
This woman is talking to these gay guys that want to get married and she won't

1488
01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:47.200
let them and they're saying under whose authority?
Like why,

1489
01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.320
what the video would drive you crazy.

1490
01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:50.920
Why does it matter of faith to put those on,
put those on,
put those on,

1491
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.430
<v 5>check this out.
Go full screen.
Cause this is awesome.
Let's to issue marathons</v>

1492
01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:02.630
the nines or stay based on what I would ask you,

1493
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:05.210
why are you not going shitty marriage licenses today?

1494
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:09.750
Because underwriting authority.
Are you nodding

1495
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:14.840
to do this?
They got to know you didn't treat us.

1496
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.770
I don't like to out till you are interrupting.
You can,

1497
01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.400
you can call the police.

1498
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:27.830
<v 2>That's awesome.
Yeah.
This is a change which makes our country modern.</v>

1499
01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:30.800
This is a shift in culture.
I mean this is what this is like.

1500
01:27:30.801 --> 01:27:34.490
That woman that's saying that is crazy.
She's just,

1501
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.210
she's locked in an ideology and she's like,

1502
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:41.270
her very job relies on the government.

1503
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.340
I mean that's what the government is telling her.
I mean,

1504
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:48.150
she's a government employee.
The government is telling her that you ha,

1505
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:50.000
I mean the supreme court has made a decision.

1506
01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:52.190
You have to allow these people to get married and she's like,
nope,

1507
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:56.900
I believe in God.
Well first I think though that the,

1508
01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:59.390
we also have to recognize it.

1509
01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:01.730
I don't agree with her because I'm not a religious guy,

1510
01:28:01.731 --> 01:28:05.960
but she is a new agreement is that it is a matter of faith for her and if she's

1511
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:07.340
going to be a government employee though,

1512
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:10.340
she's got to uphold the law of the land and we live in a secular society,

1513
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:13.040
which is a separation of church and state.
Do we really?

1514
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:16.850
What about one nation under God?
That's the same stain that one of people,

1515
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.460
it's the same state that wanted to teach.

1516
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.280
The school board wanted to teach creative design instead of evolution.

1517
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:24.620
Isn't it the same state where they get the devil statute?

1518
01:28:24.621 --> 01:28:26.450
Now they have to have a devil statue,
which,

1519
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:29.510
which the state has to have a devil statute as a satanist one.

1520
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:32.560
The religious right to put a devil statue or the Jesus statutes,

1521
01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.930
they have equal representation.
Do you mean no,
no,
no,
no.
Satanist.
Same.
Yeah.

1522
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:41.340
No sadness.
Sadness,
statue.
Find out.
It's crazy though,
right?

1523
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:46.490
This is really where it gets Detroit.
No,
I think,
I don't think that's it.
Um,

1524
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:50.840
there's one,
there's one in the south,
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah.

1525
01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.400
Is that,
what's that one?
A July 6th right there above Fox News.

1526
01:28:55.401 --> 01:28:56.870
That's probably the most,
whenever he,

1527
01:28:57.050 --> 01:29:00.260
whenever in doubt and you look over something ridiculous.
Fox News,

1528
01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:01.980
I mean it's a difficult thing

1529
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.970
<v 0>though because somebody has a strong religious conviction.
For example,</v>

1530
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.830
they're pro choice because it shows that,

1531
01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:09.960
I mean a pro life because they think that abortion is murder.

1532
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:13.080
Go back to that so we could see that.
That was awesome.
Look at this statue.

1533
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:17.580
It's a pretty cool statute by the way.
Look at it.
It's amazing.
It's pretty dope.

1534
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.870
So I guess it is Detroit.
I felt like it was happening somewhere in that,

1535
01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:25.500
look at that.
That's the Angel Lucifer,
right?
Look at I go ahead.
Well,

1536
01:29:25.501 --> 01:29:29.940
it's a say tannic statute that I believe they're putting up as a goof to say

1537
01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:34.941
tannic temple file file file photo provided by the satanic 10 by the way,

1538
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:39.480
I've been accused of being a satanist house.

1539
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:44.160
I went to a Duncan Trussell performed at one of the little love [inaudible].

1540
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:45.510
What's his name?
Something.

1541
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:49.620
The son or the grandson or something like that was getting married.

1542
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:54.450
Duncan Trussell performed is satanic puppet show at this guy.

1543
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:57.750
And I went there and I wore the guys tee shirt and now there's like videos

1544
01:29:57.751 --> 01:30:00.450
accusing me of being a satanist.
I just like to clear the air.

1545
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.540
I am neither a a religious person nor am I an anti religious person.

1546
01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:06.690
Um,

1547
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:10.530
I am not a satanist but I have done mushrooms and I've done some pretty powerful

1548
01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:12.050
psychedelic drugs.
So the um,

1549
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:17.480
possibility of there being another much more powerful and wise force out there,

1550
01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:22.380
it does not escape me.

1551
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.740
I think it is absolutely possible that there's something way more wise than us

1552
01:30:26.741 --> 01:30:30.660
that we're not totally in touch with.
But I also don't think it has a dick.

1553
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:33.710
So I don't think it's a,
he,
I don't think it's a his,
you know,

1554
01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.800
Christians either do Muslims,
either the tutors,

1555
01:30:35.801 --> 01:30:39.030
but why did they say in his presence?
Because his word,
if you were to,

1556
01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:43.890
for example,
give a name to y'all,
we can say I law and Yahweh,

1557
01:30:43.891 --> 01:30:48.891
but Yahweh among the orthodox is to trample on their sensibilities because when

1558
01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:54.240
you give a name to God,
okay,
when you give a name,

1559
01:30:54.241 --> 01:30:55.900
when you say God is,
this is,

1560
01:30:56.130 --> 01:31:01.050
this is what's heretical about the idea of Jesus Christ to Jews and to Muslims.

1561
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:04.770
Because if you create parameters around God,

1562
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:09.540
if you suggest God as a man or a woman,
if you suggest God has a name,
uh,

1563
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:14.570
then you are assuming to understand his greatness and his infinity hypnotize me

1564
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.010
while you're rubbing your forums there is saying this the same time I feel like

1565
01:31:20.011 --> 01:31:22.650
locked into your gaze.
That's what happens when you get,

1566
01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:26.760
when I start talking about religion,
God,
his Dick.
But here's my question.

1567
01:31:26.761 --> 01:31:28.750
When his name,
see I think some religion I didn't.

1568
01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:32.500
Christianity is a powerful religion when used the right fit.

1569
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:36.810
So a lot of questions just preach love and doing unto others as you'd have them

1570
01:31:36.811 --> 01:31:37.381
do unto others.

1571
01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:41.640
It's got powerful conversion ability of some people who saw nothing and find

1572
01:31:41.641 --> 01:31:46.440
inspiration and love through God.
Listen,
I,
I'm not a religious guy,

1573
01:31:46.441 --> 01:31:50.280
but I respect whatever that conversion can be cause a lot of good things are

1574
01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:53.620
done in the name of Jesus Christ.
Justice alive,

1575
01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:56.940
the suppressive things can be done in the name of your God.

1576
01:31:56.970 --> 01:32:01.300
So I'm not so ready to condemn all good things.
Good things can be done.

1577
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:04.990
Why are they done in the name of something that's not real and why does that

1578
01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:07.780
make that something not real?
More valuable,

1579
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:10.480
but that may be done is what's good,
but,

1580
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.300
but now hold on because when you say it's not real,

1581
01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:17.680
people have inspiration and deep feeling not real.

1582
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:21.380
From there it's real and from their religion holes,
hammering nails,

1583
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:25.120
building buildings.
I'm going to have to ask what is Donald Trump does?

1584
01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:28.270
That's the real,
yes,
son of a bitch.
He's a builder.
I think it,

1585
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:31.210
I think religious communion,
prayer,

1586
01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:35.650
meditation and things is good for making you,
it does make sure we're humble.

1587
01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:40.120
Any sort of inspiration is good.
Anything that motivates you is good,

1588
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:42.820
especially if it motivates you in a positive way.
It's good,

1589
01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:47.530
but the real problem becomes when someone like this lady decides that those two

1590
01:32:47.531 --> 01:32:50.410
guys can't get married because her God prevents it,

1591
01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:52.660
but the founding fathers had an answer to that,

1592
01:32:52.661 --> 01:32:54.610
which was to separate church and state.

1593
01:32:55.690 --> 01:33:00.310
Tommy's came along and then we had to jump back in the religious game and then

1594
01:33:00.311 --> 01:33:03.940
Ronald Reagan came along.
We jumped into the religious game with politics.

1595
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.000
Now you need to get to get elected.
You,

1596
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:11.560
Jesus Christ,
a Christian nation,
you have to,
you literally do.

1597
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.830
You have to be a Christian.
You know this is a Christian nation,

1598
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:18.880
Christian question.
Well,
it's not supposed to be.

1599
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:20.410
It's supposed to be a nation.

1600
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.280
One Nation under God was only created back when the McCarthy era was going on.

1601
01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.330
There are parts of this country where you for when you perform and you,

1602
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:33.100
you say the word Jesus,
the room gets very quiet.
You get the wrong places,

1603
01:33:33.101 --> 01:33:36.520
you're going to the wrong spots.
He just didn't know where that doesn't.

1604
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:39.340
They should know you by now.
You should be able to do anything you want.
Yeah,

1605
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.900
well I do speaking and Kentucky,

1606
01:33:40.901 --> 01:33:45.520
there's a thing that I posted that was fucking fascinating about,

1607
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:50.440
um,
the,
the,
the dangers of mis-gendering.
Someone,
um,

1608
01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:52.980
that Gad Saad,
uh,

1609
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:58.110
posted it and I retweeted it is adorable and it's uh,

1610
01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.590
the,
the fucking lunacy that's going on in colleges these days.

1611
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:07.240
You're supposed to walk up to someone and say hi.
Nice to meet you.

1612
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.340
What Pronoun should I use for your name?
Yes.
It's called fucking lunacy.

1613
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:13.990
It's lunacy.
That's the,

1614
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.400
that was the direction they said that you curative cause you don't want to miss

1615
01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:20.800
gender.
Academics have created a tyranny.

1616
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.010
There's a tyranny to how you have to walk around and speak.

1617
01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:26.320
They even want to control what you say in the bedroom.

1618
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:31.350
It's called tyranny in the name of equality and then the name of tolerance and

1619
01:34:31.401 --> 01:34:34.690
in the name of protecting the disenfranchised and the marginalized,

1620
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.880
we have created a fucking tyranny.

1621
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:41.650
I can't stand the academic world for that reason.
They drive me nuts.

1622
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:43.240
They send though,

1623
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:46.150
because there's so important when it comes to education happened.

1624
01:34:46.151 --> 01:34:48.250
Distribution of information is so important.

1625
01:34:48.251 --> 01:34:52.060
But socially there's this cause they were sciences.
Why?

1626
01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.120
Because there's spineless to these small majority of lunatics that make a lot of

1627
01:34:57.261 --> 01:35:00.290
noise.
And you know,
I'm sorry to say this and I,

1628
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:03.350
I admire a great deal of professors.
I've interviewed a number of them.

1629
01:35:03.351 --> 01:35:07.490
They're awesome and thank God for professors and thank God for academic beds

1630
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:09.110
that you know,
come up with all these ideas.

1631
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:13.040
But at the same time a lot of academics are just terrified to make a stand.

1632
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.720
They're fucking spineless cause they live in a very safe and closed environment

1633
01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.790
and they can't speak common sense a lot of times these like you people are

1634
01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:24.620
assholes.
It doesn't that lead to what we were talking about earlier,

1635
01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:27.290
we were talking about what people can tolerate.

1636
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:30.530
That people are tough because of the environment that they grow up in.

1637
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:33.320
And it's one of the reasons why people don't respect spoiled people.

1638
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.660
One of the reasons why people don't respect people grow up rich.

1639
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.700
We'll academics in a certain,

1640
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:41.510
to a certain extent are spoiled in the fact that they don't have to compete in

1641
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:42.410
the real world.

1642
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:47.150
Of course they do is they exist in a very insulated world where they take

1643
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:50.300
classes from people who have also gone through the system.

1644
01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:54.740
Then they become teachers.
And when they become teachers,

1645
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:58.970
then they have this oppressive power over the people in their class.

1646
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:01.220
And the people in their class have to listen to their ideology.

1647
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.020
They are also living under oppressive power.

1648
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:06.050
They are living under our protocol and academic protocol.

1649
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:09.290
If you ever tried to get an academic to talk about anything that he's not a

1650
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:11.810
hundred percent certain about,
boy are they terrified.

1651
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:16.580
And the academic world is about the nastiest place,
uh,
in the,
uh,

1652
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.800
talk about a battlefield of ideas.

1653
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:21.950
When you come up with an idea that's controversial,
like,

1654
01:36:21.951 --> 01:36:26.690
like a Steven pinker who said that human beings are not born a blank slate or

1655
01:36:26.691 --> 01:36:30.950
that aggression is rewarded in indigenous cultures.
Holy Shit.
Was He lambast?

1656
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.770
Yeah,
he got in a lot of trouble.
You didn't know.
There's a lot of science.

1657
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.200
The chorus back set up.
Look at this.

1658
01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:41.220
There's office for diversity and inclusion and they get the gender binary.

1659
01:36:41.751 --> 01:36:45.710
He,
she,
her,
him,
hers,
his,

1660
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.840
and then gender neutral.

1661
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.820
They them theirs and then pronunciation as it looks.

1662
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:57.830
But look at this.
Look at Z,
her and hers.

1663
01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:01.910
H,
I.
R.
S.
H.
I.
R.
H.
I.
R.
S.
Look at that.

1664
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Z.

1665
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.310
H.
E.
H.
E.
R.
E.
H.
E.
R.
E.
S.
So here you're getting a new language.
Z here,

1666
01:37:10.311 --> 01:37:12.170
hears Z here hears.

1667
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:16.070
These are fucking gender neutral pronouns that they've invented.

1668
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:20.840
They've invented gender neutral pronouns,
pronouns.
This is insanity.

1669
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.950
I don't see,
I don't think that kind of stuff sticks I think is just a training,

1670
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:28.100
but they're trying.
This is college.
This is a university of Tennessee.

1671
01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:31.700
Just trying.
They're enforcing their born enforcers.

1672
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:34.430
If you listen to these people there,
they are not tolerant people.

1673
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:37.130
Northern Nice people.
They're not seeing.
Have you seen the woman?

1674
01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.590
Have you seen the woman,
the photo of the woman who is running this?

1675
01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:44.450
This is wonderful.
It's wonderful.
She's perfect.
It's in the comments of you.

1676
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:47.720
If you look at the tweet that I found,
uh,
it's in my tweet,

1677
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:52.450
somebody posted a photograph of this.
She perfect.
She check it just of course is.

1678
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:56.070
Of course she is.
Of course she's,
she's,
no,
I don't know if she's

1679
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.250
<v 2>angry.
She doesn't have to be angry.
She's just,
well,</v>

1680
01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:00.750
how about the woman who was talking about,

1681
01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:02.470
there was a girl in college who said that we,

1682
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.470
she was trying to push through legislation within the college about micro

1683
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:10.660
aggression and,
and we've got a monitor micro aggression.

1684
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:15.060
So even your facial,
your facial,
um,
and this is Orwellian.

1685
01:38:15.061 --> 01:38:17.860
This is exactly what George Orwell wrote about in 1984.

1686
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.360
Thought Crime and face crime.
It's alive and well.

1687
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:25.980
Human beings love having control over other human beings.

1688
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:30.780
It is.
So we all have it.
I have it.
We all have it.
If I was emperor of the world,

1689
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:34.530
I know exactly what I do.
I want that power so I can do all kinds of stuff.

1690
01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.930
Because I think,
and I'm speaking to myself,

1691
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.130
I think I'm so fair and I'm so nice that I could make everything better.

1692
01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.780
Never give anybody power.
There you go.
Oh,
there you are.
There you go.

1693
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.040
There you are.
Oh,
look at her.
Yeah.
I grew up with this.

1694
01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:53.340
I went to high school with dishes up in messaging Madden.
I know all about it.

1695
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.290
Is Madness because first of all,

1696
01:38:56.550 --> 01:39:00.750
I hate to say that you hate to judge someone based entirely on their parents,

1697
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:02.880
but if someone's morbidly obese,

1698
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:06.750
that person does not have good judgment in their own biological management.

1699
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.060
Management of their own body has been grossly inept,
mismanaged.

1700
01:39:11.061 --> 01:39:13.100
That's very interesting.
It's the only way.

1701
01:39:13.101 --> 01:39:17.160
You also can't be too happy with herself.
This is not a poor person.
Okay.
This is,

1702
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:20.310
this is a person who works in university,
came then she can't.

1703
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:23.670
That's also probably not happy with herself.
Probably socially awkward,

1704
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:26.790
which no one can fault anyone for those things.

1705
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:31.650
The problem is when someone is in that predicament and they're choosing to

1706
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:33.990
dictate the rules of engagement that other people have,

1707
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:37.560
because what you're doing by creating all these gender neutral pronouns and

1708
01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:41.100
these new words ways you're,
you're trying to nerf the world.

1709
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.180
That's where you're trying to do,
try to take away the awkwardness of a boy.

1710
01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.180
Looks like a girl being called a girl.
We just like,
no,
I'm a boy.
Oh,
sorry.

1711
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.540
We'll fuck man.
You look really close to being a girl.
I'm sorry.

1712
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:54.300
I'm allowed to say that.
Yeah,
but you're not okay.

1713
01:39:54.301 --> 01:39:59.301
Or a girl who decide she's a boy and she wants to be referred to as a boy.

1714
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.520
She wants to be referred to as a heat.
Well,
okay,

1715
01:40:01.530 --> 01:40:04.120
well once you tell me that and I'm okay with it,
I don't mind.
You know,

1716
01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:07.920
if you say your name is Greg and your real name that you were born with was

1717
01:40:07.921 --> 01:40:12.120
Donna,
it doesn't bother me.
I'll call you Greg.
It doesn't bother me.

1718
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:16.200
But to say that I'm the asshole because something that's completely outside the

1719
01:40:16.201 --> 01:40:20.640
norm is weird and sticks out.
No,
no,
no.
That's,

1720
01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:22.580
that's wrong.
You know,
like it's,

1721
01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.460
it's like I don't like this middle Lygo thing that I have on my hands.

1722
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:31.260
It's weird,
you know?
And if I get really tan,
then it really shows up.

1723
01:40:31.261 --> 01:40:33.930
But I'm white so it's not that bad.
But when people would go like,

1724
01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:37.140
what's that on your knuckles?
I don't,
I don't like that.
I have to tell them.

1725
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:39.540
But of course I go out to fit a lot.
Logo.
It's a disease.

1726
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.940
I wish I didn't have it right,

1727
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:44.640
but I do have it so I don't get upset if somebody asks me a question.
Right.

1728
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.080
It's a normal question to ask.

1729
01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:48.720
My knuckles looked different than the rest of my hand.

1730
01:40:48.721 --> 01:40:52.040
It makes sense that they would want to know what's going on.
This isn't,

1731
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.920
this is not like a micro aggression.

1732
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.400
<v 1>This is human curiosity.
That's something that's abnormal.
Yeah.</v>

1733
01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:00.450
It's not a bad thing that it's abnormal.
It's not a bad thing.

1734
01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:04.450
There's a gender issue that you wish you were a woman when you were born a man

1735
01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:06.940
or you wish you were a man or you're born a woman.
It's not a bad thing.

1736
01:41:06.941 --> 01:41:11.100
It's just,
it is.
There is a difference though.
And,
and I think that we,

1737
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:15.100
what we're experiencing now with the transgender movement,

1738
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:16.480
and even to an extent,

1739
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:20.680
the gay movement is the pendulum is swinging all the way in one direction.

1740
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:25.300
And it's a,
it's a reaction to the fact that,
and this is just a fact,

1741
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:30.400
when you were a man or a woman and you felt overwhelmingly like you are a

1742
01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:34.930
different sex and you took measures to correct your current sex or you just

1743
01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:37.570
dressed up in a way that made you feel more yourself.

1744
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:39.430
So if you're a man and you're dressed in drag or whatever,

1745
01:41:39.431 --> 01:41:41.680
as a woman or for that matter,

1746
01:41:41.681 --> 01:41:46.050
if you were gay and you started having feelings when you include the,

1747
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:49.390
the problem was that in most of our history,

1748
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:54.180
you got the fucking shit kicked out of you,
killed,

1749
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.180
tarnished your job,
but ostracized and that anger and that,

1750
01:41:58.181 --> 01:42:01.330
that injustice doesn't,
doesn't go away.

1751
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.490
And so you have a lot of people that have,
are that,
that memory is very fresh.

1752
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:10.360
That wound is very,
so let's have some fake pronouns.
The,
the way that,

1753
01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:14.680
the way the waiting she waited.
That is then,
then,
uh,

1754
01:42:14.681 --> 01:42:16.420
try to,
uh,

1755
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:21.340
control the majority of the population behavior.
What about here?

1756
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:26.210
Z H I liked that are zero.
They have those z.
It's one of them.
Yeah,

1757
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.720
I know.
I was in,
I listened.
I went to high school in Massachusetts.

1758
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.020
I remember when I had to,
when I had to say,
I couldn't say freshmen,

1759
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:33.310
I had to say fresh person.

1760
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.970
I dated a girl who graduated from Wellesley college with a degree in women's

1761
01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:41.590
studies.
Women's studies.
It's all about women.
Yeah,
I know.

1762
01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:46.720
It's wonderful.
I should shave her legs.
There was a white girl I suffered.

1763
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:51.400
I dated a white girl.
She didn't shave her legs.
Yeah.

1764
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:55.160
It's very European.
No,
it's very hippy,
bro.
That's,

1765
01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.700
it has nothing to do with European me.
That's fine.
But her,

1766
01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.990
her roommate was Greek.
I got in trouble for this,
but her feet looked like quill.

1767
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:06.480
Go Bag.
And women are hot though.
Hairy feet,
bro.
Shit.
Hairy toes.
Hairy feet.

1768
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.010
This was the girl you were with?
Nope.
The other girl.
Her,
her roommate.

1769
01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:13.590
When you're a younger man,
you'll fuck a bear.
It does.
I mean,
I don't know.

1770
01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:17.980
She was beautiful,
but she was blonde.
She's a pretty girl.
And uh,

1771
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:22.960
the,
uh,
the roommate there was a girl I dated who was liberal white girl.

1772
01:43:23.890 --> 01:43:25.920
There was this white girl and uh,

1773
01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:29.590
and she majored in African studies and college.

1774
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:32.530
And I went and all I did was this,
I go,
why?

1775
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:37.300
Because I knew the answer was she was the liberal white girl and just wanted

1776
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:39.760
other black people.
It'd be like,
you're my favorite white.

1777
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:43.330
You're my favorite white and you understand us and you're down with our,
cause.

1778
01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:47.950
I know it wasn't because she was interested in African studies and then I said,

1779
01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.230
because I said,
why,
why,
why?

1780
01:43:50.231 --> 01:43:53.300
What about why you choose to study African studies?

1781
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:57.830
Not that there's anything wrong with it and not say what you come from like

1782
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:00.620
European history.
Why would you care what she's telling you?

1783
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:03.260
I just wanted to know the answer.
Okay.
And what was her answer?

1784
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:07.820
She said her answer was,
I wish she wasn't even at a black guys.

1785
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:12.560
She goes,
I find that question offensive.
And I said,
Whoa,

1786
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:14.810
that's what I thought you'd say.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1787
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:18.110
But I thought you'd say why I find that question offense because I'm not

1788
01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:22.340
prejudice at all.
So that's a good question.
It's a good question.
If you say like,

1789
01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:26.120
I'm a professional poker player.
Oh,
why?
It's a fair question.

1790
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:30.350
How do ma'am maybe you wouldn't say why.
Yeah,
you wouldn't say why,

1791
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:35.240
but you would say we want to be a poker player.
Why?
Yeah,
that's a good question.

1792
01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:38.840
That's a real question.
If you said,
I want to be a professional poker player,

1793
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:41.090
I would definitely say why.
People ask me what if they want,

1794
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.310
they want to be actors and I asked him why all the time.
Why?

1795
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.850
What is it about acting that will you want pay attention to that now?
Hold on.

1796
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.980
Do you want what you see at the awards are going to be to come here?
Yeah.

1797
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:57.500
He's not even an actor.
Kanye West and Donald Trump,
in my opinion,

1798
01:44:57.501 --> 01:45:01.160
in many ways.
In my least favorite Americans,
huh?
No,
no I'm not.

1799
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:04.220
I'm not talking about the politics or anything else.
I just think,
and here's,

1800
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:05.390
I have a thought about that.

1801
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:09.530
I actually think that they would have benefited a great deal and they're

1802
01:45:09.531 --> 01:45:12.420
accomplished.
Don't say slavery.
No,
they would have been

1803
01:45:14.170 --> 01:45:17.000
Tom trunk would have been great slave.
Um,
sir.

1804
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:18.950
I think they would have benefited a great deal.

1805
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.960
I follow me on this line of logic.

1806
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:25.310
I don't think they've ever been punched in the face well and hard by somebody

1807
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:26.660
who knows how to punch.
And here's what I mean.

1808
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.610
The first time I got punched in the face,

1809
01:45:28.611 --> 01:45:31.670
I actually got kicked in the head by a black belt and I got knocked out.

1810
01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:35.930
It hurts so badly.
I fucking renounced God.
You know,

1811
01:45:35.931 --> 01:45:38.840
I was just like thanking God before you go.
No,
but I mean,
in other words,

1812
01:45:38.841 --> 01:45:39.560
I was like,

1813
01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.320
I thought it was the center of the universe and I got kicked in the head and I

1814
01:45:42.321 --> 01:45:45.650
fell forward.
I woke up and I was like,
I quit everything.

1815
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:48.710
I don't want my mom and a warm glass of milk and I want a nap.

1816
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:54.250
And it was a seminal moment when I was 18 because I realized I was definitely

1817
01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:58.280
not the center of the universe and I was definitely not the tree.

1818
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:02.900
I was just a tiny leaf on a very big tree that um,
you know,

1819
01:46:02.901 --> 01:46:04.250
could be plucked very easily.

1820
01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:07.430
It was kind of a profound moment cause that kind of pain and that kind of

1821
01:46:07.431 --> 01:46:11.660
vulnerability where I realized,
Oh man,
it's easy to kill me.

1822
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:16.580
I heard you don't lie.
Don't Trump has gone through like a ton of,
I don't know,

1823
01:46:16.581 --> 01:46:18.160
but he doesn't act like it.

1824
01:46:18.161 --> 01:46:21.800
And that's like a successful guy that's rich as fuck and insulated.

1825
01:46:21.801 --> 01:46:22.860
That's what he absolutely,
yeah.

1826
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:26.060
And a guy who knows a lot of the people at the top and thinks they're dopes.

1827
01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:29.690
He actually had a guy who donated a shit load of money to Hillary Clinton's

1828
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:33.620
campaign so that she came to his fucking wedding and she did.

1829
01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.260
And she did.
Okay.
So when you recognize that,

1830
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:42.590
then you,
you kind of understand why he acts the way he acts.
He,

1831
01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.990
if you walked into room feeds,
we talked the king.

1832
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:48.530
If you walked into rueful retards and you got a rifle in your hand and he said,

1833
01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:50.100
sit the down.

1834
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.960
<v 2>I'm running this town now.
Okay,</v>

1835
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:56.270
cause you retards had been out shooting my cows and fucking my dog and lightened

1836
01:46:56.271 --> 01:46:59.010
my house on fire.
Everybody sit the fuck down.

1837
01:46:59.190 --> 01:47:02.730
We'll in a lot of ways to a guy like Donald Trump when he's talking about all

1838
01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:05.520
these people in Congress,
didn't know the difference in the Shia and the Sunni.

1839
01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:05.730
Yeah.

1840
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:08.550
When he's talking to these people that did make these decisions based on shitty

1841
01:47:08.551 --> 01:47:09.120
evidence,

1842
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.240
when he's talking about all these fucking people that are secretly playing poker

1843
01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:15.870
on their fucking cell phones and they're making gigantic decisions are jerking

1844
01:47:15.871 --> 01:47:19.770
off under the table and they get caught.
He knows that he's been around too long.

1845
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:23.790
I'm not saying,
I said,
I hear you saying I don't,
I don't like his arrogance.

1846
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:25.710
I don't like what he said about Mexicans especially.

1847
01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:30.150
That's so it's short sided and it's neglecting bullshit.

1848
01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:32.910
Building old shit around the center.
Neglecting what?

1849
01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:36.540
What's the difference between Mexicans and Americans the first place?

1850
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:39.300
It's just luck.
It's luck and opportunity.

1851
01:47:39.301 --> 01:47:41.910
They're all just human beings that got unlucky.

1852
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:46.200
If you were born in fucking war is you would be just like them a fuck so fuck

1853
01:47:46.201 --> 01:47:49.800
off.
When when he says that kind of Shit,
especially him,

1854
01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:52.650
you got lucky bitch.
Yeah,
you got lucky.
You got lucky.

1855
01:47:52.651 --> 01:47:54.270
You weren't born in Tijuana.
If you were,

1856
01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.420
you'd be just like born to a father who had a lot of money.
That's right.

1857
01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:00.720
Son of a bitch,
but that's why he's like,
yes,

1858
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.280
<v 1>this,
what do you think of this?
You know what?</v>

1859
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:07.130
When we a big chief concern,

1860
01:48:07.131 --> 01:48:11.000
always an elections as the economy and I'm always fascinated that we never

1861
01:48:11.001 --> 01:48:16.001
higher economic studs guys who actually made a lot of money in the economy and

1862
01:48:16.281 --> 01:48:17.114
competed.

1863
01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:20.480
Instead we hire our government bureaucrats and I don't know what the answer is,

1864
01:48:20.481 --> 01:48:24.140
but it seems very counterintuitive for the,

1865
01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:29.220
for voters to vote for of say a guy like Barack Obama who actually didn't leave

1866
01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:32.540
any,
he never really worked in that.
He was a community organizer.

1867
01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:36.320
He never had a real job and then he was,
he went to head kind of okay.
Grades,

1868
01:48:36.321 --> 01:48:39.950
I think an Occidental.
And then I think Columbia.
And then he taught at Harvard,

1869
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.950
left no academic papers or legacy and then was kind of kind of Greece greased

1870
01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:48.380
into the being a senator and didn't leave any legislative legacy.

1871
01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.300
And you look at the guy and he's a really good speaker and he seems sensible and

1872
01:48:53.301 --> 01:48:54.134
fair,

1873
01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:59.140
but it's interesting that we voted for him and I voted for him primarily on the

1874
01:49:01.221 --> 01:49:06.221
idea that he was black and different and sent a good message to the world are a

1875
01:49:06.741 --> 01:49:09.610
thousand reasons,
but I know I wanted to show the world that are,

1876
01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.490
that we weren't a prejudice nation after the war and that we were a progressive

1877
01:49:13.491 --> 01:49:17.300
group of people and that Obama did seem really sensible and they seen fair and

1878
01:49:17.301 --> 01:49:21.680
he seem thoughtful.
Um,
so I've kind of,
I'm criticizing myself for this,

1879
01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:26.440
but I think it makes sense to vote for somebody sometimes.
Like,
you know,

1880
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.310
Republicans make it fucking so hard to vote for him.

1881
01:49:28.311 --> 01:49:30.770
But I just feel like if you really care about the economy,

1882
01:49:30.771 --> 01:49:34.190
vote for a guy who had to really compete and win in the economy,

1883
01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.010
they might have a better understanding and perspective.
Right.

1884
01:49:37.011 --> 01:49:41.270
But would they be the best qualified dealing with social issues?

1885
01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:45.260
I wouldn't be the best qualified to deal with international dilemmas.

1886
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:48.130
Well the international probably,
but social issues,

1887
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:52.630
<v 2>I think the best way to deal with social issues is to do exactly nothing maybe.</v>

1888
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:57.340
Do you think that it's possible that the whole idea of being a president is just

1889
01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.970
antiquated?
It's all just some Alpha male primate monkey shit.

1890
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:05.690
We have to have a top dog now because the way the presidency,
the way the,

1891
01:50:05.691 --> 01:50:06.120
the our,

1892
01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.180
our government is organized is fantastic and a lot of ways in terms of the

1893
01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.780
president still has veto power but needs a two thirds of the majority.

1894
01:50:13.781 --> 01:50:15.880
That didn't stop us from going into the Iraq war,

1895
01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:18.640
which is what you originally talked about.
Yes,
that's true.

1896
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.220
And also if you look at the president,

1897
01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:23.960
like if he relies on Congress and Congress realized,

1898
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:27.790
I mean all of those laws that are set up in place to make sure that he doesn't

1899
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:31.960
have like ultimate power can be,
well,
why do I say there in the first place?

1900
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.170
Why do we,
why do we have that?
Why do we need one person?

1901
01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:40.050
Why is there supposed to be one?
Because,
because ultimately you need one at wet.

1902
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:44.530
Ultimately the responsibility of the president is when you have six different

1903
01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:45.011
sources,

1904
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:48.070
the State Department and then intelligent and all these people coming to you

1905
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:52.930
with the options.
You do need a decision maker.
Really.
One guy that seems so good.

1906
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:56.710
One guy still never one guy though.
If he really is that good,

1907
01:50:56.711 --> 01:51:00.910
why would he have Joe Biden as a second car?
Stop and think about that.

1908
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:04.000
We'll have Joe Biden's been in government for a very long time.

1909
01:51:04.001 --> 01:51:08.230
When you watch the Joe Biden steroid hearings when he's talking about steroids,

1910
01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.210
when the congressional baseball in Titian,
he's so silly.
Yes.

1911
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.260
He's such a silly,

1912
01:51:14.261 --> 01:51:17.350
he's considered a blow hard by a lot of people on the other side of the aisle.

1913
01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:20.910
Oh Man.
Joe Biden,
if you talk to him,
you talked to anybody who's,

1914
01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:25.750
who's been in government a long time.
He's kind of a blowhard.
I mean he's,

1915
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:28.670
he's,
he's a blustery guy.
Silly guy.
Yeah,

1916
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.630
you really shouldn't be the top dog for the fucking country,

1917
01:51:31.631 --> 01:51:32.980
but he's one heartbeat away.

1918
01:51:33.090 --> 01:51:38.090
And being the top dog vice president has always been what your president allows

1919
01:51:38.771 --> 01:51:39.520
it to be.

1920
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.330
So vice president is typically a ceremonial title where you go to different

1921
01:51:43.331 --> 01:51:46.300
ceremonies,
but it's never been,
it's really interesting.

1922
01:51:46.301 --> 01:51:48.610
It's an interesting role because it can be a very,

1923
01:51:48.611 --> 01:51:53.050
very sort of a morphis vacuous pointless job.

1924
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.480
It had been up until Dick Cheney,

1925
01:51:55.481 --> 01:51:59.170
it's one of the reasons why Dick Cheney snuck in the puppet master.

1926
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:03.790
He figured out like,
I'll just take this gig that Dan Quayle had,
you know,

1927
01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:04.840
I mean,

1928
01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.490
I'll take this gig that really dumb motherfuckers had except Al Gore.

1929
01:52:09.490 --> 01:52:14.140
Al Gore was pretty well respected,
smart guy.
He was respected in some circles.

1930
01:52:14.141 --> 01:52:17.740
But Al Gore Gore never had much of a backbone.

1931
01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:21.970
Al Gore was always criticized for never really having a strong position on much

1932
01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:25.450
so,
but if you look at a guy like a Barack Obama,

1933
01:52:25.451 --> 01:52:29.470
what he's like is like a really strong headliner that takes a shitty opening act

1934
01:52:29.471 --> 01:52:31.180
with them on the road.
You know,

1935
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:36.070
because if you listen to Joe Biden talk and you know,
he said,
okay,

1936
01:52:36.071 --> 01:52:40.810
it's all right.
It just,
it's not offensive to ears.
It's not a terrible speaker.

1937
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.070
But then Obama is so good.
He's so,
so,
so powerful.
He,

1938
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:49.190
everything seem some comfortable.
He such a good talker,
but he also,

1939
01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:52.460
at the end of the day,
I think,
you know,
he says he's a big free market guy,

1940
01:52:52.461 --> 01:52:55.910
but I think Obama really does believe in top down authority.

1941
01:52:55.911 --> 01:53:00.330
I do think he really believes that,
um,
ultimately,
uh,

1942
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:04.970
a central group of smart people should be making most of the decisions.

1943
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:06.020
I feel that from him.

1944
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:11.140
Anybody who watches fucking storage wars should think that watching naked and

1945
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:13.820
afraid,
you don't want to,

1946
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:16.430
you don't want to stop these people from making the critical decisions.

1947
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:20.690
But this ward,
this world's fucking future.
Yeah,
you can't,

1948
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.650
you can't just have everybody know it.
I mean,
that's a terrible thing to say.
No,

1949
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:28.340
but you can certainly have top down,
you need a federal government,

1950
01:53:28.341 --> 01:53:29.690
my God for certain things.

1951
01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:32.990
But you also middlee isn't electoral college ultimately.

1952
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.740
Isn't that a really fucking scary thing?
And I,

1953
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:39.050
you can decide this is a representative of the state.

1954
01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:42.850
So the state votes for representative.
Well,
I'll tell you what I,

1955
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:45.650
I'll tell you what the good side of it is.

1956
01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:50.680
What it means that states that have very small populations aren't ignored.

1957
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:55.580
Right?
And that's why they go to Iowa right now.
That's something that you need.

1958
01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.920
Um,
that's why the politicians go to Iowa.

1959
01:53:58.130 --> 01:54:00.200
There's an intelligent argument to get rid of the electoral college.

1960
01:54:00.201 --> 01:54:02.040
They fucking dust these farmers off.
They,

1961
01:54:02.050 --> 01:54:05.030
they sit them down and they'd say a bunch of bullshit to them.

1962
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:07.450
That's because they believe that arts there and also because the,

1963
01:54:07.451 --> 01:54:11.030
they can't read.
So they just let her know that's him.
That's him.
That's him.

1964
01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.313
That's a mistake.

1965
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:17.400
A lot of farms or they don't read it all too busy planting rain.

1966
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:20.570
They're picking corn all day.
Got It.
They don't have any time for reading.

1967
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:23.180
Those farmers are actually most of this farmer's smart.

1968
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:27.050
Well there you have to be.
Look,
it's a very,
it's a very tight business.

1969
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:31.490
Like your margins are very small and also there's weirdness like subsidies like

1970
01:54:31.770 --> 01:54:34.730
Whoa,
wait a minute.
You few shops.
If it wasn't for subsidies,

1971
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.090
there's a lot of farms that would be done of course a long time ago.

1972
01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:42.830
And guess who benefits from subsidies?
Huge corporations.
Yeah,
huge factory farms.

1973
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:46.210
Corporations and the corn industry.
There's a book,

1974
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:50.660
there's a fucking fantastic documentary called king corn.
Who?
Cas.
Ooh,

1975
01:54:50.661 --> 01:54:53.810
it's fucking nuts man.
These guys,
they set out,

1976
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.640
I mean I've mentioned it several times in the podcast,

1977
01:54:55.641 --> 01:54:58.190
so I apologize if you've heard this before,
but if you haven't seen it,

1978
01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:00.500
just check it out.
The Sky they did,
did do like a,

1979
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:04.520
an analysis of their own bodies and find out what percentage they are.

1980
01:55:04.521 --> 01:55:08.630
Of course some ridiculous percentage of all the carbon in their body has come

1981
01:55:08.631 --> 01:55:12.080
from corn and then they go through the aisles of the supermarkets and they start

1982
01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:15.020
looking at the corn syrup and corn starch and corn,
this accord that,

1983
01:55:15.021 --> 01:55:19.470
and you realize how much fucking corn is in everything and huge lobbying efforts

1984
01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:24.470
and good for ya.
Now not,
no.
God Damn it makes a state good though.
Yeah.

1985
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:25.610
Do you prefer a grass fed steak?

1986
01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.640
I like grass fed steak only because only because I just believe there ruminates

1987
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:33.740
I've been told that they're supposed to eat class,

1988
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:36.550
so I liked these in a more natural,
I don't know their tastes,
Becker.

1989
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.240
I don't know if it tastes better,
but for me it does,

1990
01:55:38.241 --> 01:55:41.600
cause my mind says this is grass fed,
I'm going to be healthier.

1991
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:45.120
They're different.
I wouldn't say I prefer grass,

1992
01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:50.160
but there's something about a really nice fatty corn fed ribeye that I

1993
01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:54.150
understand.
It's delicious.
100%.
Some of it's really good,
but uh,

1994
01:55:54.330 --> 01:55:57.300
it's not good for the animal that's for fuck shore and it's darker meat.

1995
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:59.790
And I got to feel like darker meat is better for you.

1996
01:55:59.791 --> 01:56:04.740
I know that's probably not logical,
but the way,
the way the meat,

1997
01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.670
it's a way of cow.
If a cow eats the way it's biologically supposed to,

1998
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:13.470
I'd imagine that it's probably better for you.
Well,
I feel like that about eggs,

1999
01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:18.090
you know.
Um,
sometimes my chickens,
I,
I leave them in the chicken house.

2000
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.680
It's a big fucking chicken house.

2001
01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:23.550
Just had a chicken die the other day for no reason.
They just die.
They just die.

2002
01:56:23.551 --> 01:56:25.380
His die chicken is out live long.
Well,

2003
01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:28.000
I don't know how long they live in a little chicken hearts get out.
Nope.

2004
01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:31.650
Nothing happened to it.
It was in the,
in the coupe and the coupe.
It's more,

2005
01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:34.890
I call it a coupe,
but it's really a chicken house.
It's big.
Did you check?

2006
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:35.970
It's back for peck marks.

2007
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.300
They did peck it depicted as soon as it went down there.

2008
01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:43.560
Fucking cannibals as monsters.
They would eat it.
Wow.
They're packed at it.

2009
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:46.710
But it wasn't dead for very long for,
we found it.
Um,

2010
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.730
point being when I don't let them out,
their eggs don't taste as good.

2011
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.300
The eggs look different,
their eggs become more yellow.

2012
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.910
And I buy the best chicken food that you can buy,

2013
01:56:56.911 --> 01:57:00.750
the healthiest chicken food you could buy,
but really they want a free range.

2014
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.860
And when you let them go and then they run around the yard and they pick grass

2015
01:57:04.861 --> 01:57:08.700
and they eat bugs there eggs are much more delicious.
And there were a dark,

2016
01:57:08.701 --> 01:57:13.590
dark yolk.
Yeah,
there's a d the other day I took a photo because a,
I was a,

2017
01:57:13.591 --> 01:57:17.210
I had eggs and two of them were from an,
uh,

2018
01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:19.320
an egg from when they were grazing.

2019
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.490
And two were from a little bit later when we had them in the coop for a few
days.

2020
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:25.460
And when they're in that coop,
they're there.

2021
01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:28.710
They're fucking eggs come out yellow like supermarket eggs.

2022
01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:33.270
Not quite that yellow,
but pretty close.
Whereas otherwise there are dark,

2023
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:35.640
dark orange and they literally taste different.

2024
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:38.920
I got to think they're more nutritious.
I mean,
it only makes sense.

2025
01:57:38.921 --> 01:57:42.390
It certainly tastes better.
Your eggs,
I've had x from your,
your coop.

2026
01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:47.490
They're amazing,
right?
The Joe Rogan eggs.
Delicious.
You get them the day of like,

2027
01:57:47.491 --> 01:57:49.800
I get them in the morning and then I cook them.

2028
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:54.280
I'll have like an egg sandwich for breakfast on some eat chickens and bread.

2029
01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.970
[inaudible] bread.
Ooh.

2030
01:57:56.971 --> 01:58:01.050
Is He keels good stuff with [inaudible].
I like to take the Jalapeno.

2031
01:58:01.810 --> 01:58:02.500
Hi.

2032
01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:07.500
Then I take some l you could teco or maybe some rochus and I put it over at

2033
01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:13.530
fucking sliced Jalapenos on top of being,
you know,
mayonnaise.

2034
01:58:13.531 --> 01:58:17.610
I'm not scared of Manet's,
Bro.
Nah,
don't be afraid of Manet's.
Put a little swath.

2035
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:20.430
Fucking work out.
If you want to torture my wife,

2036
01:58:20.431 --> 01:58:23.460
you'd give her Manet's and onions mixed in.
She'd throw up immediately.

2037
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:25.650
She doesn't like either one of those like myself,
some Manet's.

2038
01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:29.100
She can't look at Manny's really?
What do you do?
You have a food that you can't,

2039
01:58:29.370 --> 01:58:33.430
you just can't eat.
No,
I'm a man.
Jesus.
Fuck is wrong with you.
Okay.

2040
01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.330
What do you have any rain?
So,
because I've eaten brains before,

2041
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:39.630
not main lambs brains.
I want any tongue.
Her brain's really,

2042
01:58:39.631 --> 01:58:42.040
I'm not crazy about kidney and slides that it's just,

2043
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.380
<v 0>I don't like the texture of tar.
Yeah.
Choose none and make the tongue.
Yeah.</v>

2044
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:49.220
Kosher tongue.
Cow Tongue ever had it?
Hmm.
No,

2045
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:52.330
I did have it as a kid and I said,
this looks like a tongue.

2046
01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:55.210
And my grandfather said it's not a tongue.
And I got,
it looks like tongue.

2047
01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:59.320
I was in Greece and I ate it and I was like,
fucking Tom.
It was Tom.
It,

2048
01:58:59.321 --> 01:59:03.670
I never read it again.
When we were in Montana and we ate that deer skull.

2049
01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:06.960
You didn't eat name that deer tongue when they chopped up the deer tone.

2050
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:10.280
But I eyeball,
I remember when I ate,
I,

2051
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:14.360
Steve gave me the fat behind the eye ball.
It was raw and I ate that.
Yeah.

2052
01:59:14.370 --> 01:59:18.870
What was that called again?
Talo.
Talo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It takes so choosy.
Chewy,

2053
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:21.540
chewy.
Yeah.
I didn't need it.
I saw you eating it.
It was disgusting.

2054
01:59:21.541 --> 01:59:24.810
I was calmer and then I ate the ravine.
Calmer.

2055
01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:28.440
Makes me sad to this day.
Yeah.
Because,
uh,

2056
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:32.340
one of the funniest things that happened on the trip with Brian and I when we

2057
01:59:32.341 --> 01:59:36.090
went to Montana with Steve Rinella and crew is it Brian created a character

2058
01:59:36.091 --> 01:59:39.450
called the ravine calmer where I was going to come in and it has only been a few

2059
01:59:39.451 --> 01:59:43.800
times in my life where I almost blacked out from laughing because that was one

2060
01:59:43.801 --> 01:59:46.500
of them.
But you're never going to see it.
You never get to see it.

2061
01:59:46.501 --> 01:59:51.500
Cause that's fucking good old fashion outdoorsman sportsmen's channel.
You know,

2062
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:54.310
we choose this and we're out there hunting part of it.
It's,

2063
01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.210
I like to do it to you guys like Steve and,
and Dan Dougherty who,

2064
01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:01.740
who don't know what to do when I go,
hey,
is anybody using this ravine?

2065
02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:03.570
If not,
I'm going to come in it.

2066
02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.990
You might have a come in the ravine where you started getting angry and yelling

2067
02:00:06.991 --> 02:00:11.190
at,
I checked off my,
if I didn't really hear Jack off,

2068
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:14.550
kept talking about being the ravine calmer and you had to be there.

2069
02:00:14.551 --> 02:00:18.390
But the point being is like,
it's not a lot of our ridiculous silliness.

2070
02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:19.980
We'll never make it on his show.
No.

2071
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:24.540
So we're doing this amazing performance for like,
you're doing it more than I am.

2072
02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:28.500
You're,
yeah.
I'm not that kind of your different kind of on than I am.
You know,

2073
02:00:28.501 --> 02:00:29.370
when we go to these things,

2074
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:32.700
it's one of the reasons why I love having you around because you just love

2075
02:00:32.701 --> 02:00:35.190
making everybody laugh.
You love making me laugh to hear everything in the world.

2076
02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:39.860
Yeah,
you're,
you're just reduced weekend.
I made somebody laugh for one hour,

2077
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.100
the groom of the wedding and I,
and this is so sick,
but I made him laugh.

2078
02:00:44.101 --> 02:00:45.900
I've never made anybody laughed at heart for what?
I did,

2079
02:00:45.901 --> 02:00:50.250
an hour of material and it was all,
his son is a really good looking 17 year old.

2080
02:00:50.251 --> 02:00:52.410
The rest are really muscular and really smooth.
Oh,

2081
02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:56.470
this is us were Turkey hunting?
Is this a,
it's a short clip from a,
let's play it.

2082
02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.850
Let's wait.
Hold on my story.
Please play it.

2083
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.820
Let's hear it.
Cool.

2084
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:05.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

2085
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.830
<v 0>All right.
Walk.
Yas.
Sportsmans channel network.</v>

2086
02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:11.600
<v 3>Okay,</v>

2087
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.390
<v 0>well let's let it load up.
We had just leave it right there.</v>

2088
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:17.140
We had a good fucking time though,
Matt.
It was a good time to time.

2089
02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.720
Turkey hunting though is for the birds.
Yeah.

2090
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:23.360
Here's what the problem with Turkey hunting.
If you love Turkey hunting,

2091
02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:27.860
I appreciate it.
Absolutely.
I get it.
I,
I,
I shot a Turkey.
We ate some of it.

2092
02:01:27.861 --> 02:01:29.570
It was delicious Turkey.
Yeah.

2093
02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.580
<v 3>Get this all like the call on the moon,</v>

2094
02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.180
but trying to locate,

2095
02:01:42.330 --> 02:01:45.480
<v 2>I was asleep and snoring and Steven knows like you're sleeping on it.</v>

2096
02:01:45.481 --> 02:01:49.010
Didn't know.
It wasn't like lying down snoring.
Well you wake me up.

2097
02:01:49.011 --> 02:01:51.920
I will fucking tell you I wasn't sleeping automatically.
Yeah.

2098
02:01:51.921 --> 02:01:55.010
What is it about that?
It's like that vulnerable feeling.
Like I'm,
I'm awake.

2099
02:01:55.011 --> 02:01:57.590
It's embarrassing.
I W I S L I wasn't sure.

2100
02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.920
I was sure that I was awake,
man.

2101
02:02:00.921 --> 02:02:05.310
I slept nine hours of time and I kept it a secret from my wife and I'm like,

2102
02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:08.000
where are we?
Where are you?
I go,
I was in the garage.
I liked her.
I go,

2103
02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.780
I was working out in the,
uh,
I was sleeping for two hours and I lied.

2104
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.800
I lied right to her.
Like I was like,
Nah,
I was in my office working out.

2105
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:20.660
We need a hunting show where we do it online with nobody sponsoring it.

2106
02:02:20.690 --> 02:02:24.520
Nobody.
Like we're just,
we do it the same way we have done with podcasts.
Yeah,

2107
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:25.543
we need that.

2108
02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.260
I need to just finance it and I'll just hire some dude to just film us.

2109
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:33.650
We'll take someone like Brian Callahan or something like that.

2110
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:35.450
Take us hunting somewhere and we'll just film.

2111
02:02:35.451 --> 02:02:38.490
It wasn't just first how much [inaudible] costs.

2112
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.670
I mean how much could it really possibly cost if we just had like a sponsor like

2113
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:46.460
rifles that we use or you know,

2114
02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:49.070
products that we use like Hoyt bows or something like that.

2115
02:02:49.071 --> 02:02:53.360
Just a sponsor that it could help us defer some of the costs of production.

2116
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.050
It would be so much fun because these,
these trips,

2117
02:02:57.051 --> 02:03:00.560
like the trip that we had when we went out to a Alaska and we went into the

2118
02:03:00.561 --> 02:03:04.190
Prince Edward Island,
fucking fantastic time.

2119
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:07.340
Horrible rains we were talking about earlier with like fun.

2120
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:11.120
That's like fun logging hours,
doing it alone.
It was terrible.

2121
02:03:11.130 --> 02:03:14.750
Like we're soaking wet the entire trip.
It was,
it never stopped raining.

2122
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:17.750
If it would stop,
it stopped for like 20 minutes that we shoot.

2123
02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:21.710
Like some video footage of us being out there for 20 minutes and looking for

2124
02:03:21.711 --> 02:03:25.070
deer that we never found right.
And then he'll go right back to raining.

2125
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:28.910
It was horrible,
but we had so many fucking laughs.

2126
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.930
Just the time that we were in the trailer or the the tent rather the grants and

2127
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:37.160
we had one,
one indication of that is the podcast that we did from there.

2128
02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:40.190
Steve's podcast,
which was one of the best ones that we did.

2129
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.250
You know one of Steve's that we did where it's not censored,

2130
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:45.290
like unlike the show,
it's completely free.

2131
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:47.540
So we're there just to listen to the laughing.

2132
02:03:47.630 --> 02:03:50.510
We were giving him so much shit about his shit collection.

2133
02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.700
Remember Steve Rinella has,
he's so fucking into wildlife.

2134
02:03:55.701 --> 02:04:00.701
This dude had a stool collection of all the various animals that he had hunted.

2135
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:03.950
He had like bear shit,
duck Shisha Steve,

2136
02:04:03.951 --> 02:04:07.760
a picture of shit in the wild and he'll be like,
ah,
that's,
that's record.
I did.

2137
02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:10.280
I told them there was a fucking animal that was trying to get into my chicken

2138
02:04:10.281 --> 02:04:13.580
coop and it's shit in my yard.
I sent him a picture of it.
He said it was a skunk.

2139
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.770
Wow.
Yeah,
I see.
It was a fucking skunk outcomes.
These countries skunks,

2140
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.670
skunks will kill the fuck out of your chickens.
Skunks are Predator.
Oh,
hey.

2141
02:04:22.710 --> 02:04:26.900
All right.
Yup.
Yeah.
Sculpture predators.
That's amazing.
They'll eat birds.
Oh yeah.

2142
02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:29.150
Especially chickens.
They were trying to get to my chicken.

2143
02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:34.010
How about Rick Collins?
Oh really?
Yeah.
Raccoons with Alex.
You're a forest grass.

2144
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.410
You better run.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Do Ground nesting birds.
I said about Turkey.
He's,

2145
02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:41.130
everybody's trying to kill Turkeys all the time.
Turkey's die all the time.

2146
02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.130
A three year old Turkey's hold.
Well,
when we were Turkey hunting,

2147
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.660
we shot a Turkey.
Oops.
Spoiler alert.
But we only shot one.
It was a young,

2148
02:04:48.661 --> 02:04:53.100
stupid Turkey.
It's called a Jake.
I shot it.
Yeah.
And I'm Brian's Day.

2149
02:04:53.101 --> 02:04:57.690
When I was snoring,
Brian,
Brian couldn't fucking find a Turkey.

2150
02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.740
We couldn't find a Turk.
Gay told me Chris did a rock,
paper,
scissors.
I won.

2151
02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:02.980
So I got to shoot first.
Yeah,

2152
02:05:03.090 --> 02:05:07.440
so you use a lot of times you should have done we bullshit shot at the same time

2153
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:10.890
cause three fucking turkeys came in.
We should,
we should have said I agree.

2154
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:12.660
Let's do this.
Oh God.
Three we should,

2155
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:16.650
we could have both had turkeys we thought since that was the first day book.
Ah,

2156
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.790
we're going to see a bunch of Turkeys.
This is awesome.
Yeah.
No it wasn't.
No,

2157
02:05:20.791 --> 02:05:24.720
it was a bunch of time.
Sit around and Napa Valley.
Okay.
We're not pretending.

2158
02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:26.830
We're in Alaska.
We're not in the fall.

2159
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:31.310
We went to eat at fantastic restaurants every night I want to be at Bu Shawl.

2160
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:34.460
Those dummies.
They fucking eat cheeseburgers and shit.
I'm like,
come on,

2161
02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.120
take you to the restaurant.
I'm going to pay.
Let's go.

2162
02:05:37.121 --> 02:05:40.890
But we're going to go book the hose,
drink beer,
best food in the world.

2163
02:05:41.130 --> 02:05:43.110
Like literally the best restaurants in the world.

2164
02:05:43.111 --> 02:05:45.150
And Rinella never joined us once I took fuck.

2165
02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.500
He likes to pretend he's in the woods.

2166
02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:49.800
He doesn't like the fact that he has it gets to stay in a house when he hunts.

2167
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.230
Oh,
he wants to suffer.
He wants to live in the,
in the dirt.

2168
02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:55.500
So the fact that we were going to go and drink fine wine and eat duck,

2169
02:05:55.840 --> 02:06:00.480
we ate grilled duck in Philemon.
Y'All,
we had,
there was a,

2170
02:06:00.481 --> 02:06:04.380
a potato puree took me a half hour to find the wine I wanted to,

2171
02:06:04.381 --> 02:06:09.360
I love that wonderful place.
But we,
uh,
we treated it differently than them.

2172
02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:12.420
They did not want to admit that they were staying in a house in Napa Valley

2173
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:13.440
while they were doing that show.

2174
02:06:13.441 --> 02:06:15.870
They're pretending that they're out there in the woods,
Turkey hunting.

2175
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:19.650
You're in a guy's yard.
You're in it.
You're in a guy's yard.

2176
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:22.320
You're shooting a fucking bird that I could buy down the store.

2177
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:25.470
And here's the problem.
He fucked up when he cooked his Turkey breast.

2178
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.191
Cause you know what,

2179
02:06:26.191 --> 02:06:28.380
that Turkey breast tastes just like the stuff I buy this car,

2180
02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:32.580
like fucking Turkey breasts.
No,
no,
no.
God Damn,

2181
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:36.660
this is going to be the best trick in the world.
No,
nope.
Pretty fucking boring.

2182
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:39.600
You guys stay here.
I'll go to the Deli and have the same experience.

2183
02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.230
And you know,
I guess the legs tastes a little better.
I need to cook.
You know,

2184
02:06:43.231 --> 02:06:45.790
that's what come over.
Come over this week man.
And I'll cook uh,

2185
02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.720
some Turkey and some Moose.
All right.
Cause the Turkey that we shot,

2186
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:52.950
I have that have most of it except I'm around them all.
We ate one breast,
one,

2187
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:57.060
one breast.
Let's do it tomorrow.
One fucking breast while we were there.

2188
02:06:57.061 --> 02:06:59.670
And we were like,
okay,
it tastes like he made Schnitzel.
You know,

2189
02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:03.270
like I've tried to write it or I do my podcast called the fighter and the kid

2190
02:07:03.271 --> 02:07:07.260
can use it in here.
That shows picked up by Fox.
That's some crazy deal.

2191
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:12.600
She's crazy.
Deal with Fox sports.
How about this?
We sold out.
Whoa.

2192
02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:15.230
I'm waiting for someone to come along with enough money for me to sell out.

2193
02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.080
Did we sold,
we sold the prey.

2194
02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:23.280
Oh you mean the show podcast out six weeks in advance.

2195
02:07:23.650 --> 02:07:27.330
The brand promise.
And by the way,
everybody,
10:00 PM prof,
November 12th,

2196
02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:30.990
we're going to do a live,
I like come on your life podcast in Tempe.

2197
02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:35.030
What Day is the one you did in uh,
October 1st.
[inaudible] on that fucker off.

2198
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.450
Yeah.
You're more than welcome to him on that,
but are you kidding?

2199
02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:40.330
I'm going to be on it.
That'd be great.
I'm going have a good time.
Uh,

2200
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:41.440
I didn't do it high as fuck though.

2201
02:07:41.441 --> 02:07:44.050
We're going to get tired of you guys talking sober.
Hey man,
come on.

2202
02:07:44.410 --> 02:07:46.220
Really don't push your drugs on me.
Loves me.

2203
02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:49.840
I think I'm going to get Brandon to do some standup.

2204
02:07:50.290 --> 02:07:52.990
He's definitely should do still.
Yeah.
He died July podcasts.

2205
02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:55.260
I want them to do three,
four minutes.
He should do it.
He could,

2206
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.150
he could do it on a,
every time I do in the UFC,

2207
02:07:58.151 --> 02:08:01.870
he could definitely do it on dating Ronda.
But you shouldn't tell him not to.

2208
02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:06.670
He won't.
No,
he doesn't.
She's tired of taking shit for just saying anything.
Yeah.

2209
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:09.430
Let it go,
man.
In the podcast he goes,
just so you know,

2210
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:12.160
I am never talking about that shit again.

2211
02:08:12.430 --> 02:08:16.060
He's just so sick and she's the queen of the world.
Got To let it go.

2212
02:08:16.061 --> 02:08:18.010
She's bigger than Oprah,
but he has a lot of guy.
He doesn't,

2213
02:08:18.011 --> 02:08:20.620
he's never said a bad thing about her and his life.
Well,
he does love her.

2214
02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:22.360
He does care about her.
It didn't work out.

2215
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:24.790
I've never heard that guy say one thing besides that.

2216
02:08:24.791 --> 02:08:26.580
She's great and I'm not even proud.

2217
02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:30.640
There was the one time on the podcast where he said that he's too much of a man.

2218
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.920
He just meant he meant with Rhonda.

2219
02:08:32.921 --> 02:08:36.460
It's either you are going to be taking a back seat to,

2220
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.140
she's driving the train or you need the exactly the extreme opposite that.

2221
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.350
That's what I think he was trying to say.
He didn't mean too much.
He's just not,

2222
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:46.030
he's a,
he's a strong personality.

2223
02:08:46.031 --> 02:08:48.910
She's a strong personality that that tends to be hard to diminish.

2224
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:52.510
But I'm fucking anyway,

2225
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:57.010
come see us November to change the subject.
I like how you wanted to keep going,

2226
02:08:58.910 --> 02:09:00.280
so see the fighter and the kid.

2227
02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:05.170
Well you and I really need to do is we need to do a show where it's just us

2228
02:09:05.171 --> 02:09:08.830
doing whatever the fuck we want to do and turn it into funny.
It's like,

2229
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:12.250
I want you to be on the audience.
I'll be your audience that come with you.

2230
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:13.480
We'll do things together.

2231
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.280
Most of it is like me setting you up most of the meeting or show the fun stuff

2232
02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:21.000
is me setting you up and you knock it out of the park.

2233
02:09:21.001 --> 02:09:24.850
Right over and over and over again.
Right?
But it's,
we have a weird dynamic.

2234
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:27.940
It was really funny.
And Rinella.
We,
we,
we talked about it before,

2235
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:30.250
like we were really bored at one time.
He goes,
man,
he goes,
uh,

2236
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:33.430
I wish Kevin was here right now.
I go,
yeah,
if he was here,

2237
02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:37.530
it'd be like really fun.
He goes,
no offense.
I go,
no,
it's enough.

2238
02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:39.670
I'm not funny like that.
I'm a different guy.
I mean,

2239
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:43.540
occasionally I'm funny like that.
Yeah,
but not like you can't count on it.

2240
02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:48.080
Now I'm a jackass.
I only have fun when I'm being a jackass like that.
I just,
I'm,

2241
02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.700
I'm,
I'm looking for any opening.
You're talking,
I'm not even listening.
I'm like,

2242
02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:54.490
where's the worst I can give a fuck what you're saying.

2243
02:09:54.491 --> 02:09:58.390
Isn't that a problem when you're doing a podcast?
I,
of course,

2244
02:09:58.391 --> 02:10:02.530
the problem with my life,
I've never serious,
but it's not necessarily a problem.

2245
02:10:02.530 --> 02:10:05.610
When we do stuff like that,
fucking works for stand up,
do it.

2246
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:06.920
It definitely works for standing up,

2247
02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:09.940
but it also works for doing that hunting thing.
We've got to talk to her.

2248
02:10:09.941 --> 02:10:12.760
Know about that.
Let's do it.
Say,
listen.
You can see he,

2249
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.130
I briefly talked to him and his company.

2250
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:18.490
We talked about me doing a show and I was really considering it,

2251
02:10:18.491 --> 02:10:20.050
but first of all,
I don't,

2252
02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:24.760
there's a lot of shit that I take from hunting that for no reason.

2253
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:25.660
It's so silly.

2254
02:10:25.661 --> 02:10:29.860
I take it from people that have dogs and cats and they're fucking Instagram
page.

2255
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:33.220
I got into it with this lady.
She's a very nice lady.
She's a tattoo artist.

2256
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.220
She gave me a hard time about calling a hunting a ethically retarded or

2257
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:41.270
something like that and then I went to her page.
It's just got animals.
I'm like,

2258
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:43.910
come on.
You feed your animals,
murdered animals.

2259
02:10:44.090 --> 02:10:45.950
It's the only way you're going to keep them things alive.

2260
02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:48.680
If you have dogs and a cat,
what do you feed him?
She admitted,
she goes,
yes,

2261
02:10:48.681 --> 02:10:51.040
it's not,
it's like a necessary evil.
And you know,

2262
02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:53.900
it was a very friendly exchange cause she had beautiful artwork.

2263
02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:57.830
She's a really talented tattoo artist.
I go,
come on,
this is silly.

2264
02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:01.190
Like the these does,
you're not getting this from the dog food tree.

2265
02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.390
You're going to have your horse mate from that and from cows and byproducts and,

2266
02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:10.940
and guts and feet and all kinds of shit.
They grind up and lamb,

2267
02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:13.790
which is basically baby sheep and the chickens,

2268
02:11:13.791 --> 02:11:16.970
they fucking grind chickens up and compress them into cat food.

2269
02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.770
I mean that's what it is.

2270
02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:22.220
And those animals are not happy and their will a real living thing.

2271
02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:25.520
If I shoot a moose or whatever the fuck I shoot,
that's,

2272
02:11:25.521 --> 02:11:29.690
I'm eating that whole God damn thing.
And uh,
it's one animal.

2273
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.750
And that's one of the things that I like about hunting a large animal like that

2274
02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:35.150
as opposed to like a Turkey.
If you shoot a Turkey,

2275
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:38.660
it's only going to live if it's only going to feed like a few people,

2276
02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:42.140
like a Turkey will feed five people like that Turkey,

2277
02:11:42.141 --> 02:11:46.250
we shot five people and having a meal and it's over.
But it's also this,
I mean,

2278
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.890
you know that what I always say is even trophy hunting,
which I don't do it,

2279
02:11:49.891 --> 02:11:54.891
but even trophy hunting is the revenue from those kinds of hunts.

2280
02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:59.120
I honestly hate that argument and I really want to talk to hunter's about not

2281
02:11:59.121 --> 02:12:01.880
using it because it's true.
It is true,

2282
02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:06.140
but it's so fucked up that it's true that it's more just economy.

2283
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:08.610
It's economics is economics,
but it's,

2284
02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.940
here's the deal,
right?
If you're,
if you love something,

2285
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:17.840
whether it's a elephants or rhinos,

2286
02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:19.370
you love some exotic,

2287
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:24.720
crazy animal that we don't have in North America and you,
you,

2288
02:12:24.750 --> 02:12:27.800
you want to pay a lot of money to shoot it and you're not even going to eat it.

2289
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:30.380
I guess they do eat elephants.
Um,

2290
02:12:30.381 --> 02:12:33.650
which I didn't know till I was part of getting into,
but I guess,

2291
02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:36.770
I guess it tastes good,
man.
It's fucked because they're,

2292
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:41.660
they're intelligent and they're not traditionally family structures and all that

2293
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:45.140
great memories.
They remember family members from like 20 years ago.

2294
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:48.440
They reunite them,
they hug like it's,
it's trippy man.

2295
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:53.360
I've seen a video of a mother and a child reunited after 20 years and they're

2296
02:12:53.361 --> 02:12:56.570
hugging like we don't think anything of a child leaving a family.

2297
02:12:56.571 --> 02:12:58.910
Cause that's what we do.
You know,
if you live with your house,

2298
02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:01.150
your family and your 40 or fucking loser.
Yeah.

2299
02:13:01.190 --> 02:13:03.110
But if you're an elephant and you're,
you're,
you know,

2300
02:13:03.111 --> 02:13:06.350
you have children's children's stay near you.
I was like this structure,

2301
02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.680
that's their natural structure.
We don't think anything of like separating them,

2302
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:11.720
taking them off here,
taking them off there.

2303
02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:14.870
It's one of the most damning things about something like seaworld,

2304
02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:18.500
like that they have the balls to have these commercials where they say we

2305
02:13:18.501 --> 02:13:21.470
haven't taken an animal from the wild and 35 years.

2306
02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.680
That's like a Puran having slaves saying we haven't kidnapped this person from

2307
02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:31.800
their family in another country in 35 years.
So this is okay that we keep slaves.

2308
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.900
Cause that's what Orca is.
When an Orca or a dolphin,
they're fucking slaying.

2309
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:40.320
See Black Fish.
Cause I,
I find it too upset and he'll drive you crazy.

2310
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:42.630
It would drive you crazy.
It doesn't matter what they say.
There's,

2311
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:46.950
there's no getting away from the fact those animals are kept it cause a

2312
02:13:46.951 --> 02:13:49.470
psychosis.
Yes.
There's all sorts of problems with them,

2313
02:13:49.471 --> 02:13:52.260
but there's just no getting away from the fact they're captive.

2314
02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:54.000
You're not talking about a dog man.

2315
02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:57.270
My dog got upset today because I was on the other side of the fence and I was

2316
02:13:57.271 --> 02:14:00.120
having a phone call and he's pawing at the door.
He wants to get to me.

2317
02:14:00.121 --> 02:14:02.940
Come on man,
hang out with me.
I'm like,
dude,
I'm on the phone.

2318
02:14:02.941 --> 02:14:06.000
I'm not patching a minute right now I'm on the phone and he has a j you see my

2319
02:14:06.001 --> 02:14:10.020
dogs yard shy.
It's an acre.
He just wants to be part of you.
Exactly.

2320
02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:14.510
And they don't want to be captive.
They want to be free to do whatever they want.

2321
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:16.830
And this is a dog who lives in a family.
I mean,

2322
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:20.910
he's one of the family domestic animals.
Domesticated.
He's a sweetie.

2323
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.880
He's one of the family.
You know,
he lives in the house.
He sleeps in the house.

2324
02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:27.510
He's just outside doing his shame and he doesn't like it.
Let me out,
bitch.

2325
02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:31.020
Come on.
What is this?
Imagine the madness.

2326
02:14:31.021 --> 02:14:36.021
If you are a person and you were forced to live in an empty tank or an empty

2327
02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:40.440
swimming pool like imagine if you in the same structure where an Orca lives.

2328
02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:42.540
That's your world.
How much room do they have?

2329
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:45.300
Not much at all because you know what's really terrifying.

2330
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:48.930
There's a photo of the seaworld parking lot.
It shows the parking lot,

2331
02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.950
and that shows where the Orca enclosure is in relationship to the size of the

2332
02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:56.640
parking lot.
It's fucking terrifying.
It's terrifying.

2333
02:14:57.990 --> 02:15:02.250
Tiny little thing.
Just imagine if you had to live in a drain pool,
essentially.

2334
02:15:02.251 --> 02:15:04.140
That's why it's a form of torture.

2335
02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:07.530
It is a form of torts that solitary confinement and you know the really crazy

2336
02:15:07.531 --> 02:15:11.100
animal rights activists believe that you shouldn't own any pets.

2337
02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:14.910
That I shouldn't even have my dog.
I shouldn't have my cats dogs.

2338
02:15:14.911 --> 02:15:15.990
Especially our domesticated.

2339
02:15:15.991 --> 02:15:19.410
There's a difference in a wild animals tame and that domesticated animal,
well,

2340
02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:22.610
my cat's Prudy fucking domesticated life seeing grounds.

2341
02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:27.420
We've seen fluff at five of the fuck this fucking rag doll in the morning.

2342
02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:27.691
Okay.

2343
02:15:27.691 --> 02:15:30.960
We have to be really quiet in the morning because the cat will hear your voice

2344
02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:31.781
and start me out.

2345
02:15:31.781 --> 02:15:36.781
One of the door just to come in and get pal and you see her as soon as you see

2346
02:15:36.941 --> 02:15:41.760
her,
she's like,
she immediately starts parents.
She wants,
Oh yeah,

2347
02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.620
she wants you to pick her up.
She goes limp.

2348
02:15:43.770 --> 02:15:46.080
And it's the most domesticated animal ever.

2349
02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:50.790
Anybody that wants that poor thing to fend for itself is a fucking crazy person.

2350
02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:54.690
This is,
this is a baby.
The dogs are pack animals.
Two dogs want to be,

2351
02:15:54.691 --> 02:15:58.980
I'm imagining the cats have a pride,
but dogs definitely want to be part of,
uh,

2352
02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:03.540
you know,
my cats.
I've uh,
the male and the female.
I had a cat just die.

2353
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:08.460
She was 13 years old.
It was pretty sad or not 13.
Excuse me.

2354
02:16:08.461 --> 02:16:12.410
She was 19,
19 years old when she died.
Um,

2355
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:17.010
but the other one is a seven and I'm the baby.

2356
02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:21.510
The new one is 10 months old,
I guess.
Maybe 11 months old now.

2357
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:23.820
Yeah.
I think she was born October,

2358
02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.040
so she's a fucking baby still and she's like this little fluffy fur.

2359
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:34.920
It's like the difference between her and an animal in the wild is so far removed

2360
02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.610
so many generations that it's a really odd that we do that to those things.
Yeah.

2361
02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.530
You know,
they make awesome pets,

2362
02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.200
but it's really odd that we choose to make an English bulldog that's,

2363
02:16:46.350 --> 02:16:47.720
that's sensing

2364
02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:54.690
fucking flat face.
You ever see him try to breathe?

2365
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:59.880
They overheat.
I'm like,
what did we do?
Or someone does something mean you?

2366
02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.800
What did someone do that made that thing?
Well,

2367
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:06.130
that just played with genes that that whole movement happened.
When was that?

2368
02:17:06.131 --> 02:17:10.600
In the 1920s or when we're home,
we started changing dogs.
Well,

2369
02:17:10.601 --> 02:17:11.650
I think they've done it.

2370
02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:16.180
You'd like to a certain extent through the history of dog breeding.

2371
02:17:16.181 --> 02:17:17.800
I think it's existed for a long time,

2372
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:21.940
but not to the level that they've done now where they make like Pekinese and

2373
02:17:21.941 --> 02:17:26.680
these special breeds.
And I saw a guy the other day that had two wolves.

2374
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:30.780
He was walking,
he reading,
reading tweets.
You shut the goddamn phone.

2375
02:17:31.050 --> 02:17:34.120
I go to a dare.
Just see to look that up.

2376
02:17:34.370 --> 02:17:36.610
The other thing we were talking thought though,
you're reading tweets,

2377
02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:40.330
tweets to fuck the police.
His guy was walking in the street.

2378
02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.940
There's the seaworld parking lot.
It's in the green.

2379
02:17:43.290 --> 02:17:46.880
So that green is the tank and the rest is the parking lot.

2380
02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:52.150
That's the Orkin closure.
Oh No.
Yeah,
it's horrible.
It's horrific.
Wow.

2381
02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:54.520
So this guy was walking with wolves.

2382
02:17:54.521 --> 02:17:58.180
He had pet wolves and you could tell right away it was a really weird,

2383
02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:02.980
they were really cold.
Oh God.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
They're fucking horrifying.

2384
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:07.370
They're horrifying.
But they're beautiful.
Do Wolves to me.
Um,

2385
02:18:07.410 --> 02:18:10.960
I like this amazing creature that is,
you know,

2386
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:16.090
I respect them deeply.
I love like what they represent.
I love looking at them,

2387
02:18:16.510 --> 02:18:18.490
but they feel like a trap man.

2388
02:18:18.491 --> 02:18:22.720
I think the love that some people have for animals in this really distorted

2389
02:18:22.721 --> 02:18:26.020
perception of what a,
a Predator like a wolf truly is,

2390
02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:31.120
has allowed people to import these things and put them into Idaho and all these

2391
02:18:31.121 --> 02:18:34.660
different areas.
And I'm reading all these stories about what's going on now,

2392
02:18:34.661 --> 02:18:38.470
how they're decimating the elk populations and people really terrified of him.

2393
02:18:38.650 --> 02:18:43.360
And when I was in British Columbia and uh,
I was up there with my friend Mike,

2394
02:18:43.390 --> 02:18:45.610
who was a,
a business up there,

2395
02:18:45.611 --> 02:18:49.450
have a guide business and he has a farm his fucking neighbors do.

2396
02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:53.400
They had a cow that was killed in the middle of the night by wolves.
Yeah.

2397
02:18:53.530 --> 02:18:56.800
Like they came in and kill the cow like 20 of them.

2398
02:18:56.830 --> 02:19:00.460
The problem with wolves is that there a,
you talked to any farmer,
any rancher,

2399
02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.030
why do they hate wolfs and this is the world over,
what has it been,

2400
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:06.820
have have it like in Sweden,
they're reintroducing the wolves.

2401
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:10.090
It's really controversial because the people that make their living off their

2402
02:19:10.091 --> 02:19:10.924
livestock,

2403
02:19:11.310 --> 02:19:15.910
fucking wolves are such efficient killers and keeping them out is basically,

2404
02:19:15.911 --> 02:19:19.360
it's really,
really hard.
So smart.
They're so smart.

2405
02:19:19.361 --> 02:19:23.260
They act together as a reason that farmers traditionally when after wolves right

2406
02:19:23.261 --> 02:19:26.040
away,
like whether it was in Italy and Sweden,
anywhere there,

2407
02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:31.010
there's no real society that didn't go after wolves because they were so

2408
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:32.870
devastating to your crops.
We've,

2409
02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:37.550
we've gone so far away from recognizing that and remembering that,

2410
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:41.420
that people have brought these things back in some sort of a weird attempt to

2411
02:19:41.421 --> 02:19:45.920
balance the ecosystem.
And when,
when they open hunting seasons,

2412
02:19:45.921 --> 02:19:50.000
there's all these protests and the protests are almost invariably from people

2413
02:19:50.001 --> 02:19:51.690
that live in the cities.

2414
02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:55.160
That's the issue with the difference of Vancouver in British Columbia being a

2415
02:19:55.161 --> 02:19:58.220
province.
Like the people in Vancouver,
they're all liberal.

2416
02:19:58.221 --> 02:20:01.220
It's like it's a beautiful place to live.
There's no wolves here,
man.

2417
02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:03.720
Don't go killing wolves.
But the people who live where Michael,

2418
02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:07.060
you can kill as many wolves a day as you want.
Yeah.
Because then you can't,

2419
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:09.260
you can never get rid of all.
Exactly.

2420
02:20:09.350 --> 02:20:11.840
They're really hard to find or they're elusive.

2421
02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:15.890
Ran into this guy at the airport and,
um,
he was really smart guy,

2422
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:19.910
really smart guy,
and really articulate guy up in Canada and,
um,

2423
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:23.330
ask me question,
you know,
what are you here for?
Blah,
blah,
blah.

2424
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:25.970
I forget what he told me his business was.
I probably wouldn't say it anyway.

2425
02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:30.500
Somehow or another people would figure out who it is.
But he was,
uh,

2426
02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:32.000
it was talking to me about his business.

2427
02:20:32.001 --> 02:20:34.070
We were talking a little bit and he asked me when I was up here for,

2428
02:20:34.071 --> 02:20:36.950
and I told them I was up there for a hunting trip and then he started talking to

2429
02:20:36.951 --> 02:20:41.810
me about how much he hunts wolves.
Like right away he goes into this.
Yeah,
we,

2430
02:20:41.811 --> 02:20:44.780
uh,
we hunt wolves all the time and he goes,
you got to,

2431
02:20:44.781 --> 02:20:48.300
I own a piece of property up there and we've seen them chase down,
uh,

2432
02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.320
calves and kill them.
He goes,
we've seen it.
And he goes,

2433
02:20:51.321 --> 02:20:53.000
we've seen the wolves he goes to,
they're just,

2434
02:20:53.001 --> 02:20:56.540
there's so many of them that what we do is they take garbage bails,

2435
02:20:56.630 --> 02:21:01.630
like a big garbage pail and they fill it with meat and then they pour water into

2436
02:21:02.031 --> 02:21:05.330
a,
the garbage pail.
So it's filled to the top with water and meet.

2437
02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:08.660
Then they freeze it and once they freeze it,

2438
02:21:08.661 --> 02:21:11.990
then they take it and they put it out like a popsicle.
Wow.

2439
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:13.940
And then the wolves can't take it all at once.

2440
02:21:13.970 --> 02:21:15.650
So they'll definitely keep coming to it.

2441
02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:18.240
So they get a little bit of the meat and I'll come back from war and they got to

2442
02:21:18.241 --> 02:21:21.410
chew through the ice and there's meat inside the ice and then they'll shoot them

2443
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:25.580
and he said,
you,
he goes,
we shoot them all year long.

2444
02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.780
We have to shoot him as many,
as many as we can.
I've heard the,
the um,

2445
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.150
we didn't even reality,

2446
02:21:31.330 --> 02:21:34.400
the end unit used to take as well as just such a nightmare for them.

2447
02:21:35.230 --> 02:21:37.340
It's still their food,
their seal at nights of that.

2448
02:21:37.341 --> 02:21:38.810
And they would put a razor blade,

2449
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:42.550
like a knife with a piece of meat on it and the wolf would eat the meat and then

2450
02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.500
lik to the blade,
cut themselves up and die.
They would,

2451
02:21:47.501 --> 02:21:51.050
uh,
yeah,
they would put blood on,
uh,
on,
on keep licking their on blood and knife,

2452
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:54.230
razor sharp knife.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was terrifying.
Oof

2453
02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:59.810
Our square to list those worlds,
man.
That's those worlds.

2454
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:03.620
I really think that there's a certain amount of struggle,
like you said,

2455
02:22:03.621 --> 02:22:07.640
a certain amount of losing makes you more humble and respectful.

2456
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.950
And like what you were talking about where a guy like Donald Trump,

2457
02:22:10.970 --> 02:22:13.810
it's all this sort of conversation is all coming around in this morning.

2458
02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:16.910
We do here,
you know,
but it really isn't this one.
It's like,

2459
02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:21.110
and what we were talking about about academia,
about,
uh,
the,
the,

2460
02:22:21.111 --> 02:22:25.160
the cowardice of this new way of pushing,

2461
02:22:26.530 --> 02:22:29.850
feeling,
feeling something,
hit,
hitting a wall is very important.

2462
02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:32.390
And their thought bullies who thought bullies about it and what we'll,
we're,

2463
02:22:32.391 --> 02:22:35.500
where's that all coming from?
Well,
I mean,
it really is coming from the,

2464
02:22:35.501 --> 02:22:38.760
so there's a lack of real world experience at a lack of adversity.

2465
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.020
The adversity has only been electrical diversity.
So this adversity rather.

2466
02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:44.280
So there's these conversations.

2467
02:22:44.290 --> 02:22:46.350
They're having the battles that are going on there.

2468
02:22:46.390 --> 02:22:49.200
There were about ridiculous shit.
They're not about survival.

2469
02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:51.660
There are about calling someone z or he,

2470
02:22:51.810 --> 02:22:55.320
and there's anger and there's rhetoric and there's protests.

2471
02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:00.480
And then there's this like there's this crazy need to control what the other

2472
02:23:00.481 --> 02:23:04.860
people think and what is acceptable and not acceptable on my fucking campus.

2473
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:10.110
Have you ever seen the Toronto protests?
Somebody's sensibilities is sacred.

2474
02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.990
Ever seen the Toronto protest where these feminists,
uh,

2475
02:23:12.991 --> 02:23:16.410
there was some guy who was promoting something about something that had to do

2476
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:19.680
with men's rights.
They completely distorted what he had to say,

2477
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:24.210
completely distorted what his message was and promoted him as this like evil

2478
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:28.500
person who supported rape and hated women.
And so they shut down his,
uh,

2479
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:32.130
his performance that by turning on a fucking fire extinguisher fire alarm,

2480
02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:36.120
they set off a fire alarm and all cheered.
They were protesting in the hallways.

2481
02:23:36.121 --> 02:23:40.650
While this guy's on stage speaking.
Sure.
That's not surprising.
It's,
it's a,

2482
02:23:40.651 --> 02:23:43.080
it's a hostile act.
It's a controlling act.

2483
02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:46.050
It's exactly what the Red Guard did in Mao's China.

2484
02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:50.010
And there are a thousand examples of people that get swept away with an
ideology.

2485
02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:53.760
These are very religious people and by that I mean they're fanatically devoted

2486
02:23:53.761 --> 02:23:58.761
to what they think is a certain truth or set of truisms and they'll do whatever

2487
02:23:58.831 --> 02:23:59.760
they can.
Well,

2488
02:23:59.761 --> 02:24:03.300
that's why it's important what you're saying because they'll do whatever they

2489
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:07.260
can to,
but what,
it's not based on his reality.

2490
02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:12.350
So like if there really was a person that was at this campus that was promoting

2491
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:14.220
raping women and,
and,

2492
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:17.580
and doing horrible things to them and this is what you should do and he's trying

2493
02:24:17.581 --> 02:24:18.414
to rally them up.

2494
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:22.620
Absolutely everyone agrees they should be treated the way these women were

2495
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:24.330
treating that guy.
The question is,

2496
02:24:24.570 --> 02:24:29.570
is what he's promoting that or are you turning it into that in order to make it

2497
02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.000
justifiable for you to go fucking crazy?
Because that's what a lot of it is.

2498
02:24:34.290 --> 02:24:35.041
What a lot of it is.

2499
02:24:35.041 --> 02:24:40.041
People decide they have a target and then justify their actions based on that.

2500
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:45.040
Also they decide they shoot their guns at the wrong target.
Uh,

2501
02:24:45.210 --> 02:24:46.470
because it's an easy target.

2502
02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:49.710
And that's an important point though in their defense.

2503
02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.090
I mean if someone really is promoting rape,
fuck that guy.
Right,
right.

2504
02:24:54.450 --> 02:24:59.340
So that would be a realistic reason to use that target for what you're saying
it.

2505
02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:01.320
So they make them that they make,

2506
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:05.100
they distort what he is and they turned them into that.
So then it's justifiable.

2507
02:25:05.130 --> 02:25:07.410
Yes.
And the women were screaming,

2508
02:25:07.411 --> 02:25:09.150
get these men that were trying to go in and listen.

2509
02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:12.280
All they wanted to do was hear what this guy had to say.
Screaming ethic,

2510
02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:15.360
you fucking piece of shit.
You support rape.
Like what are you talking about?

2511
02:25:15.361 --> 02:25:19.620
But this,
this anger and violence and vitriol gives them a cause.

2512
02:25:20.130 --> 02:25:22.980
People want to,
cause there's no diversity.
I want to feel like they're,

2513
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:24.090
they're revolutionaries.

2514
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.920
<v 1>There is no,
there's not enough diversity with healthy.
It's not healthy.</v>

2515
02:25:27.930 --> 02:25:29.830
It's also not,
it's not honest.

2516
02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:32.440
I don't think they're being honest with themselves or with,

2517
02:25:32.441 --> 02:25:36.760
with what the real problem is.
And that's another issue is that if you,

2518
02:25:36.761 --> 02:25:38.980
if you're too ideological and religious,

2519
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:43.981
you're going to be placing your energy and your anger in the wrong direction and

2520
02:25:44.291 --> 02:25:48.340
there are real challenges and problems and it takes so birth thought,

2521
02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:53.490
Soper thought sober analysis and an open mind to finding out and developing a

2522
02:25:55.391 --> 02:26:00.391
very informed point of view so that then you can actually tackle what's really

2523
02:26:00.791 --> 02:26:04.630
going on.
So good luck finding someone else who also taking the same amount of

2524
02:26:04.631 --> 02:26:08.410
consideration into a subject and has an approach to it with some intense bias.

2525
02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.720
Exactly.
So having these debates,
these people,

2526
02:26:10.721 --> 02:26:12.700
it's like there's this bridges you can't cross.

2527
02:26:12.701 --> 02:26:15.100
There's things that you can't say.
Well,
there's very important though.

2528
02:26:15.101 --> 02:26:17.140
Now when you have a debate,
and I'll give you an example,

2529
02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:20.980
very important in my opinion,
the problem with debate in this country is this.

2530
02:26:20.981 --> 02:26:24.370
Let's take gun control as an example.
The first thing you hear is,

2531
02:26:24.371 --> 02:26:27.670
I'm in favor of guns.
I'm not in fear,
I'm in favor of gun control.

2532
02:26:27.671 --> 02:26:29.950
But when you actually hear,
when they started,
the debate is this,

2533
02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:32.440
you're a gun nut and I don't like you.

2534
02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:35.950
You're a hippie liberal and you don't know what this country was founded on and

2535
02:26:35.951 --> 02:26:38.080
that's where we start in the minute that happens,

2536
02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:41.470
there is no way anybody's going to have a discussion because it starts with I

2537
02:26:41.471 --> 02:26:45.910
don't like you.
Oh yeah,
I don't like you.
Instead of instead of saying,
hey guys,

2538
02:26:46.390 --> 02:26:46.751
we're,

2539
02:26:46.751 --> 02:26:49.510
we're both good people who have a different point of view and we're trying to

2540
02:26:49.511 --> 02:26:50.344
solve a problem.

2541
02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:54.310
Nobody in this room thinks that somebody should be allowed to go on and
massacre,

2542
02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:57.280
uh,
a school or a movie theater.

2543
02:26:57.310 --> 02:26:59.590
We know we want to solve that problem.

2544
02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:02.410
Now this side believes everybody should have guns.

2545
02:27:02.411 --> 02:27:04.810
This side believes they shouldn't.
Where is the middle ground?

2546
02:27:04.811 --> 02:27:08.020
Let's have a real discussion.
It never starts that way.
Unfortunately.

2547
02:27:08.021 --> 02:27:11.890
A lot of times it just becomes this crazy sort of,
uh,

2548
02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:13.060
this is my camp,

2549
02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:18.090
this is my idea and I'm more and more interested in being right based on my

2550
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.930
ideology.
That's immovable and it's very difficult.

2551
02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:26.560
It's very difficult to kind of step back and be sober in these thoughts,

2552
02:27:26.561 --> 02:27:29.660
at least in these situations.
For example,
like like gun control.

2553
02:27:29.661 --> 02:27:33.140
It's interesting because when this guy came up and shot these two reporters and,

2554
02:27:33.141 --> 02:27:36.370
and this psychiatrist happened recently and a psychiatrist,

2555
02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:38.890
I think his name is Lieberman,
Jeff Lieberman,

2556
02:27:38.891 --> 02:27:40.510
anything cause he's out of Columbia University.

2557
02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:43.180
He said something really and probably a black guy,
right?
He was a black guy.

2558
02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:47.080
[inaudible] he has Jeff Lieberman now Julie writes,
he's Jewish.
I knew it.

2559
02:27:47.650 --> 02:27:50.110
You guests.
Good guess,
good guess.

2560
02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:53.440
But he had something really interesting to say and it was a really interesting

2561
02:27:53.441 --> 02:27:58.080
debate I'd never heard before.
He said,
look,
um,
mental illness,
um,

2562
02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:03.430
there is an idea that may be if somebody is exhibiting psychotic behavior and

2563
02:28:03.431 --> 02:28:06.430
talking about wanting to hurt other people in himself.

2564
02:28:06.730 --> 02:28:11.230
A lot of people who have mental illness are not willing to take their drugs

2565
02:28:11.231 --> 02:28:12.760
because they don't think there's anything wrong with them.

2566
02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:16.750
So how do you deal with that?
Well,
he said,
what about,

2567
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:18.700
what about in some instances,

2568
02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:22.010
outpatient care that is mandated and we'll

2569
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.260
<v 2>wait a minute.
That's that steps on my civil rights.</v>

2570
02:28:24.261 --> 02:28:27.860
You can't tell me to take drugs.
And he said,
but wait,
if you have tuberculosis,

2571
02:28:28.250 --> 02:28:32.060
you are mandated by the Center for Disease Control to take your drugs because

2572
02:28:32.061 --> 02:28:36.300
you're contagious and you're not allowed to not take antibiotics when you have a

2573
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.010
tuberculosis.
And usually it's a nine month regimen.
It can turn you color blind.

2574
02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:44.330
Like I did my buddy Jimmy Burke and all that.
But what about,
what about,

2575
02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.000
what about those questions?
What about stuff that kinda throws things in the air?

2576
02:28:48.001 --> 02:28:52.080
A Hey,
you just filled me with a cloud of whatever.
Trying to give you contact.

2577
02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:56.390
Know those are,
those are important questions to raise men.
They are,

2578
02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.200
I didn't know Jimmy Burke went colorblind.
Yeah.
From his antibiotic regimen.

2579
02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.490
Fuck yeah.
He's color blind now.
And what is that from?
What disease was it?

2580
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:09.020
He had tuberculosis and so it just,
the antibiotics just killed it forever.
Yeah.

2581
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:13.490
Whoa.
Yeah.
But he had to take them.
So what do you think if somebody,

2582
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:16.660
if somebody is saying I want to kill people and he's just saying it's illness

2583
02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:19.640
and I think it is a good idea to treat it as it is an illness.

2584
02:29:19.641 --> 02:29:23.810
And the problem with the mental illness stigma and Kara Santa Maria who's been

2585
02:29:23.811 --> 02:29:28.040
on this podcast a bunch of times,
she's a neuroscientist,
very smart,

2586
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:31.310
and she's had mental illness issues herself with depression,

2587
02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:34.250
which is also a mental illness.
So not well.

2588
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:36.880
We treat them differently than we treat any other illness.
Like if you,

2589
02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:39.740
there's no shame in having a diabetes,
you know,

2590
02:29:39.741 --> 02:29:43.550
we find out that you have a disease and we don't go fuck a diabetes Bro.

2591
02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:47.150
Like it's a disease.
So we treat it with medics,
medicine,
you know,

2592
02:29:47.151 --> 02:29:50.540
same thing with virtually every disease except mine diseases.

2593
02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:52.160
And when someone doesn't mind disease,

2594
02:29:52.161 --> 02:29:54.110
we automatically assume that they're being weak.

2595
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.680
We automatically put them into this box,
oh,
you're depressed.

2596
02:29:57.890 --> 02:30:01.270
I'll pour fucking baby.
Think going to be fine,
dude,
we're going to be here.

2597
02:30:01.290 --> 02:30:05.360
You're happy.
You're a fucking bored.
And the 16 hundreds you know,

2598
02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:08.390
there's all the nonsense that comes with people admitting that there's a

2599
02:30:08.391 --> 02:30:12.080
chemical imbalance in their brain,
which we,
we can't really measure.

2600
02:30:12.081 --> 02:30:14.060
That's the problem.
They can't fucking,

2601
02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:17.810
they can't just pull the juice out of your brain and measure you for depression.

2602
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:19.880
You know,
and they can't really measure,

2603
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:23.870
like there's no like scale to chose what drug is going to work for you.
Right.

2604
02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:26.990
Which is one of the weirdest things about taking antidepressants,

2605
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:31.060
but whatever the,
whatever the case there,

2606
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:34.220
it's some form of medication for a disease.

2607
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:36.830
And when someone doesn't want to take that medication,

2608
02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:37.940
this is one of the episodes,

2609
02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:41.820
the episode I was talking about of called elements on,
um,
uh,

2610
02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:43.700
radio lab that was talking about lithium.

2611
02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:48.260
This woman who can't take this medication and,
but once she takes it,
she's her,

2612
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:52.490
he,
she,
it is a mental illness.
She has mental illness being bipolar.

2613
02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.970
It's an absolute disease.
And when she takes this stuff,
she's totally normal.

2614
02:30:56.420 --> 02:31:01.420
So this idea that we have about medication when it comes to mental illness,

2615
02:31:02.901 --> 02:31:07.730
I think it's the one illness that we have this like criticism of,

2616
02:31:07.731 --> 02:31:11.450
or this prejudice of that we could just do because it's hard to measure.
Yes.

2617
02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:14.570
Yeah.
And,
and who decides and there are,

2618
02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:18.470
there is criteria and there is,
there are experts that can say,

2619
02:31:18.471 --> 02:31:21.180
I think in some instances,
hey,

2620
02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:25.710
this dude is exhibiting classic psychotic behavior and he's going to hurt

2621
02:31:25.711 --> 02:31:26.544
somebody.

2622
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:31.550
And I think it would behoove the authorities to mandate some kind of a drug

2623
02:31:31.921 --> 02:31:35.080
regimen or something.
Now this is really know when to say it though.

2624
02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:38.820
Nice guy would that hasn't done anything yet.
He just seems a little off.

2625
02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:41.160
You don't know what it is.
Right?
It's dicey.
It's a very,

2626
02:31:41.161 --> 02:31:43.830
very tricky stuff because now you're talking about a government agency coming in

2627
02:31:43.831 --> 02:31:45.980
there and making you take drugs.
Yeah.
Um,

2628
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:52.070
but in some instances it might save a lot of lives if you've got a crazy person.

2629
02:31:52.290 --> 02:31:57.290
And the question becomes what if that is a viable alternative to having people

2630
02:31:57.931 --> 02:32:00.390
get shot up in some instances?
What do you do about it?

2631
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:03.870
If it's a really good question and a really hard one to answer because here's,

2632
02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:07.140
here's another factor.
When you experiment,
when you do an experiment,

2633
02:32:07.290 --> 02:32:11.640
the fact that you're doing an experiment has a,
an,

2634
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:14.700
it has an effect on the results of the experiment itself.

2635
02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:18.510
A classic one that we've talked about on this podcast for thing was Carl Hart

2636
02:32:18.511 --> 02:32:20.880
that brought this up,
a brilliant point that I'd never even considered.

2637
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:24.300
They'd always talk about these things that they do with rats.
You know,

2638
02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:28.860
they give rats a heroine and the rats.
So I do the heroin every day and then,

2639
02:32:28.861 --> 02:32:31.800
you know,
they can't do on their tasks,
but if you give them cocaine,

2640
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:35.370
they just do cocaine until they die.
When he goes,
yeah,

2641
02:32:35.371 --> 02:32:39.820
but they're in a cage during an experiment.
This isn't a normal rat change.

2642
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:43.740
It's changed the rat cage changed the entire extra drugs.
You can't just,

2643
02:32:43.741 --> 02:32:47.520
it's not like you're giving them cocaine in the woods.
Well,
if you did that,

2644
02:32:47.580 --> 02:32:50.730
you would have like much more reasonable results.

2645
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:54.080
Do you know what the results were as fascinating?
So they laced the,

2646
02:32:54.081 --> 02:32:57.330
the water with cocaine and heroin.
The rats kept doing it until they died.

2647
02:32:57.570 --> 02:33:00.600
And then this experiment came along and said,
why don't we change the rat cage?

2648
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:05.370
I'll create rat Disneyland and the rat.
He created a,
a utopia for rats.

2649
02:33:05.371 --> 02:33:08.370
They had plenty of sex friends play with lots of things to keep themselves

2650
02:33:08.371 --> 02:33:09.090
occupied.

2651
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:13.350
Do you know how many rats kept going back to the cocaine and heroin bottle?
None.

2652
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:17.760
After awhile they,
from what I,
from what I was told,

2653
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:22.470
the experiment yielded no addiction and they all started drinking water and went

2654
02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:24.510
back and they kind of said,
I'm done with that drug thing.

2655
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:28.860
So one changes things up.
We'll also,
okay,
let's think about that for a second.

2656
02:33:28.861 --> 02:33:31.380
Because if we're living the way we're living today,

2657
02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:34.740
it's because people before us have figured out how to build houses and

2658
02:33:34.741 --> 02:33:37.230
electricity and cars,
but how many generations,

2659
02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:41.090
how many generations in relationship to the DNA that's in our body that's

2660
02:33:41.091 --> 02:33:46.091
supposedly takes like 10,000 plus years to to change or I mean how,

2661
02:33:46.831 --> 02:33:51.270
how similar are we to people that live 10,000 years ago?
Probably almost exactly.

2662
02:33:51.271 --> 02:33:54.450
Are really a logic.
Really,
really,
really fucking close,
right?

2663
02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:58.830
Maybe the reason why people were into drugs and constantly trying to alter the

2664
02:33:58.831 --> 02:34:03.831
state of their consciousness today is directly connected to these rats.

2665
02:34:05.130 --> 02:34:09.240
Being willing to do this experiment or be willing to go back to the cocaine

2666
02:34:09.241 --> 02:34:12.420
until he fucking died in this experiment as opposed to where they were in the

2667
02:34:12.421 --> 02:34:15.300
wild.
Like maybe if we were living in the wild,

2668
02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:19.390
maybe if we lived the way live thousands of years ago,
it's a hunter gatherers.

2669
02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:22.330
Maybe if we did that,
we would have no desire to do coke.

2670
02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:25.650
<v 1>I would agree with you if I didn't know that pygmies in certain parts of the</v>

2671
02:34:25.651 --> 02:34:28.560
Congo smoke copious amounts of weed.
Yes they do.

2672
02:34:28.561 --> 02:34:31.920
And if people in the Amazon who are hunter gatherers take all kinds of,
yeah,

2673
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:34.480
<v 2>I'll just stop and think about the drugs that you just described.</v>

2674
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:38.650
Copious amount of weed,
which makes them more sensitive,
more paranoid,

2675
02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.190
maybe keeps them alive,
more,
more community oriented,

2676
02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:46.270
more loving and may be even more creative.
So you're talking about marijuana.

2677
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:48.790
If you're talking about the people that live in the indigenous tribes in the

2678
02:34:48.791 --> 02:34:52.690
Amazon,
you're talking about serious psychedelic drugs that are ego dissolving,

2679
02:34:52.691 --> 02:34:57.691
that removed the world around you and bond you inexorably as this tribe.

2680
02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:00.850
So you're not talking about heroin and not talking about coke,

2681
02:35:00.851 --> 02:35:04.900
especially not talking about coke,
like how many fucking people they do.

2682
02:35:04.930 --> 02:35:08.410
They do chew coca leaves and a lot of those,
uh,
those environments,

2683
02:35:08.411 --> 02:35:13.150
in fact in Peru.
Yeah.
But it's,
coca leaves got as well and,

2684
02:35:13.151 --> 02:35:15.830
and that Ethiopia and places,
God is a,
but that's more,

2685
02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:18.910
isn't that more like a narcotics and narcotic?
Yeah,
but the,

2686
02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:23.020
the coca leaves apparently it's really nice.
It's really nice.

2687
02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:26.200
It's God keeps you mellow or is it,
does it own hype you up?

2688
02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:31.120
I think it's a stimulant.
I think.
I think that's a shitload of it.

2689
02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:36.090
In the Middle East.
I remember it as a kid.
Yeah.
I wonder if,
uh,

2690
02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.630
we went back to living this sort of subsistence life.
If,

2691
02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:42.580
if any of that stuff would have any pull on us at all.
I don't know.

2692
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:47.310
<v 1>But I do think that the new science of like Portugal decriminalized all drugs,</v>

2693
02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:49.710
all drugs.
And what they did is really interesting thing.

2694
02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:52.950
They think by some measures in 2000,
uh,

2695
02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:55.560
1% of the population was hooked on heroin,
which is incredible,

2696
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:59.040
huge addiction issue.
And you have to be careful with these statistics.

2697
02:35:59.041 --> 02:36:04.041
But this is what I heard on ted.com and when the government said,

2698
02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:04.890
I'll tell you what,

2699
02:36:04.890 --> 02:36:08.640
instead of spending all his money on enforcement and Rehab and stuff,
we'll,

2700
02:36:08.641 --> 02:36:12.690
we'll take,
addicts will decriminalize it.
And what Addicks need is connection.

2701
02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:14.520
So what we'll do is we'll say,
well,

2702
02:36:14.521 --> 02:36:16.380
we'll get them in rehab and we'll take care of that.

2703
02:36:16.381 --> 02:36:19.200
And then we'll get them a job and we'll say to their employer,
look,

2704
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:23.670
train this guy.
We'll pay,
we'll pay half their wages.
Uh,

2705
02:36:23.671 --> 02:36:27.900
it'll cost you half as much to hire this addict who is going to take your

2706
02:36:27.901 --> 02:36:29.550
program.
We have our own programs.

2707
02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:32.760
They're managing their addiction and they've had huge success because what

2708
02:36:32.761 --> 02:36:36.990
happens to the addict is that they develop connections and they develop a

2709
02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.940
purpose and to develop,
uh,
uh,
you know,

2710
02:36:39.941 --> 02:36:42.870
an an entire infrastructure of support around them.

2711
02:36:43.290 --> 02:36:46.530
And that apparently from what I understand,

2712
02:36:46.531 --> 02:36:50.660
a lot of like addiction specialists talk about that being very important man

2713
02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:52.530
connection is,

2714
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:56.310
is a great anecdote or antidote to your,

2715
02:36:56.460 --> 02:37:00.270
your addiction issues.
Um,
I'm not an addiction.

2716
02:37:00.810 --> 02:37:01.890
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm not either.</v>

2717
02:37:01.891 --> 02:37:04.780
I think one of the big problems with addiction specialists in this country is

2718
02:37:04.781 --> 02:37:09.000
they're only allowed to use methods outside of drugs.
There's a,

2719
02:37:09.001 --> 02:37:11.940
there's some people that get some spectacular results and other countries,

2720
02:37:11.941 --> 02:37:15.180
especially in Mexico with Ibogaine or people that are hooked on pills,

2721
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:18.830
I've again,
I began is a,
it's from the Boga plant and it's,
um,

2722
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:22.880
it's really intensely introspective drug that is a,

2723
02:37:22.881 --> 02:37:27.140
it's not a fun time at all.
There's very,
very little recreational ibogaine cause,

2724
02:37:27.141 --> 02:37:31.340
just like really intense,
um,
view of your life.
Very,

2725
02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:35.030
very deep and complex view of your life.

2726
02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:40.360
And it also shuts off some physical reactions to addiction somehow or another

2727
02:37:40.671 --> 02:37:44.300
rewires the mind.
Some strange way that's very,
very effective.

2728
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:49.510
I've had friends that have had pill problems that have gone to these retreats in

2729
02:37:49.581 --> 02:37:53.660
Mexico and that Ibogaine treatment and just completely knocked it out.

2730
02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:56.480
How much they just placebo.
No,
no.
It's not placebo at all.

2731
02:37:56.481 --> 02:38:00.200
I don't think because we were talking about it's an insanely intense

2732
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.560
introspective experience that's not not dissimilar from the DMT trip that you

2733
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:10.370
went on in the,
the fact that it dissolves reality,

2734
02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:15.080
it dissolves reality in some sort of strange way and then I haven't experienced

2735
02:38:15.081 --> 02:38:18.050
the Ibogaine those trips,

2736
02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:20.750
but I have quite a few friends who've done it in.

2737
02:38:20.751 --> 02:38:23.450
Every one of them said it sucked like they did not like it,

2738
02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.740
like it's really harsh,
but the results are spectacular.
Like the results,

2739
02:38:27.741 --> 02:38:30.320
like when you get through that you're like,
okay,
I see it all.

2740
02:38:30.321 --> 02:38:33.140
It's all mapped out now.
Like what am I doing with my life?

2741
02:38:33.141 --> 02:38:35.570
Like what are all these pitfalls that I've set up for myself?

2742
02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:39.110
What are all these traps that I've like left in my personality?

2743
02:38:39.290 --> 02:38:43.400
What are all these these excuse mechanisms that I have just ready to fucking pop

2744
02:38:43.401 --> 02:38:47.060
off and send me to the bar?
What are those things when you see them?

2745
02:38:47.061 --> 02:38:49.550
Like they're a like,
like,
like targets.

2746
02:38:49.770 --> 02:38:53.630
You see them all around you like really obvious landmines.

2747
02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:56.390
It's weird how people have like a lot of us,
we all have some of those,

2748
02:38:56.391 --> 02:38:57.021
but for me,

2749
02:38:57.021 --> 02:39:01.490
my way of getting out of that is I just asked myself what I really want and I

2750
02:39:01.491 --> 02:39:03.110
think that's helpful.
Like when I just go,

2751
02:39:03.111 --> 02:39:07.880
what do I really want to do and we'll get good at one thing really interests me.

2752
02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:10.880
I think.
You've never been addicted physically to anything?
Now I have.

2753
02:39:10.881 --> 02:39:14.000
I so I think we're talking out our ass when it,
when it comes to that.
Yeah.

2754
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:17.840
I never had,
thank God.
I feel,
I feel lucky that I don't have that.

2755
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:21.080
I don't drink much.
I don't,
I never had any of that stuff.
So yeah,

2756
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:24.170
that's the pill one and the heroin one man,

2757
02:39:24.171 --> 02:39:28.220
that is a god damn crazy when the coq one,
I've seen them all and they're there.

2758
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:31.960
They're real hard to figure from the outside.
I haven't experienced what the,

2759
02:39:31.961 --> 02:39:34.580
the ache in their bones.
Well,

2760
02:39:34.581 --> 02:39:38.630
what about how much people drink in this country and have always,

2761
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:43.130
this country has always been a nation of drinkers,
and that's why we get gas.

2762
02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:46.910
If you don't give a fuck,
we were drunk.
We make sure it happens,

2763
02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:52.340
but it's responsible for a lot of great art too.
You know?

2764
02:39:52.430 --> 02:39:55.880
That's one thing that people don't want to admit if course how much fucking

2765
02:39:55.881 --> 02:39:58.370
great music was created by drunk people.
I don't know.

2766
02:39:58.371 --> 02:40:03.371
I think a lot of great music was start with clearway people who sat in a in

2767
02:40:04.131 --> 02:40:06.500
rooms and just played music.
Well,
that's true too.

2768
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:10.180
There was a fucking say that that what destroyed the Haight Ashbury movement at

2769
02:40:10.181 --> 02:40:14.030
wonderful psychedelic movement was when,
when musicians went from weed

2770
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.400
<v 1>and psychedelics to heroin and cocaine and the heroin and cocaine was what</v>

2771
02:40:17.401 --> 02:40:20.970
actually destroyed a lot of great musicians.
Yeah,
but that's coke.

2772
02:40:20.971 --> 02:40:22.450
We're talking about booze.
Yeah.

2773
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:25.950
I think there's been a lot of artists that have used booze,
including writers.

2774
02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:29.460
Historically.
There's been a lot of writers that were drunk.
Stephen King,

2775
02:40:29.461 --> 02:40:33.240
when he was strong,
his book,
which I already said,
there are a lot of,
yes,

2776
02:40:33.241 --> 02:40:35.700
there are a lot of creative people that have substance abuse problems.
He said,

2777
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:38.160
but they happen to be very creative people with substance abuse problems.

2778
02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:41.880
He said they were creative and then they,
they had,
they had a problem.

2779
02:40:41.881 --> 02:40:45.240
But it's not what made them creative.
That's possible that he's right.

2780
02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:48.870
But it's also possible that he's saying that because he's not an addict anymore

2781
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:50.760
and he doesn't want to go back to it.

2782
02:40:50.761 --> 02:40:53.610
And so he's made this sort of connection in his mind that it wasn't the alcohol

2783
02:40:53.611 --> 02:40:55.770
that allowed him to be so free and creative.

2784
02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:00.090
It was his own free creativity that he had in his mind.
And he had a problem.

2785
02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:05.010
It is true.
Here's another positive correlation and causation.
There's,

2786
02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:06.960
they're not clearly defined in this snow.
Now,

2787
02:41:06.961 --> 02:41:10.830
here's another possibility to people that are creative,
um,

2788
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:13.980
and do and have great imaginations and allow themselves to have a great

2789
02:41:13.981 --> 02:41:17.670
imagination.
May also be in some,
to some degree,

2790
02:41:17.671 --> 02:41:21.840
may be a little self destructive or at least searching for different states.

2791
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:25.470
And so maybe,
maybe you know,

2792
02:41:25.471 --> 02:41:29.640
that the kind of person that's imagined enough to write a book like Cujo also

2793
02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:34.850
likes putting himself in something other than his sober state total boss as

2794
02:41:35.371 --> 02:41:37.530
well.
Totally possible as well.

2795
02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:40.920
But I think there's also some thoughts that come to you when you're drunk.

2796
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:44.890
Like I've done some drunk writing,
especially on airplanes.
God,
I'm an idiot.

2797
02:41:44.891 --> 02:41:49.010
And when I'm drunk,
well I listen to like music and uh,

2798
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:51.390
have a couple Budweisers and uh,

2799
02:41:51.450 --> 02:41:55.320
I'll write and I'll write some stuff that I might not.
Right.
Dude,
I you,

2800
02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:58.920
when we were doing the ice house one time,
I was with one of the first times,

2801
02:41:58.921 --> 02:42:02.340
it was in a small room and I smoked a bunch of weed and I don't do it.

2802
02:42:02.341 --> 02:42:07.140
And I got high doing your podcasts and I drank some scotch because you force me

2803
02:42:07.170 --> 02:42:08.160
peer pressure,
I don't think.

2804
02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:13.080
And I wrote and I got up on stage and crushed the room with a whole thing.

2805
02:42:13.081 --> 02:42:15.600
I kind of in about how I saved a whale.
Now,

2806
02:42:15.601 --> 02:42:19.590
I never would've thought about saving a fucking whale,
uh,
without that state.

2807
02:42:19.591 --> 02:42:23.520
So I maybe it did open up some channels,
but here you can get back to the booze.

2808
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:26.610
Here's what Oliver delayed delayed.
Oliver Sacks said something incredible.

2809
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:30.030
Do you know the story about Philip Platinum?

2810
02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:34.620
I think it's Jason and I think his name's furniture salesman.
1994,

2811
02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:36.050
uh,
comes out of a bark.

2812
02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:41.050
It's savagely beaten and starts having sort of deep mathematical geometrical

2813
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:45.690
thoughts.
And I've seen,
you know,

2814
02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:48.750
he starts drawing these geometric relationships and shapes.

2815
02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:53.010
A physicist walks by one day and goes,
do you know what you're doing?
And he said,

2816
02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:55.740
no,
I just,
I'm trying to figure out the relationship.
And he goes,

2817
02:42:55.741 --> 02:42:59.460
you're drawing high math.
Long story short,

2818
02:42:59.490 --> 02:43:03.270
he'd never been interested in math at all.
And 2015,

2819
02:43:03.271 --> 02:43:06.510
he is considered a math genius.
He got beaten.

2820
02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:09.000
Oliver sacks did a great thing on a guy named Tony.

2821
02:43:09.001 --> 02:43:12.370
See auria get struck by lightening.
He's an orthopedic surgeon.

2822
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.770
<v 0>The lightening goes through his cheek,
comes out of his foot.</v>

2823
02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:17.500
Tony just want to start right now.
If you're a shitty musician,

2824
02:43:17.501 --> 02:43:21.580
don't let someone kick in the head.
I've got it.
Don't do it.

2825
02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:23.380
I'm going to be a math genius.

2826
02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:25.960
Kick the shit out of me and let me see what happens.

2827
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:30.580
The most creative people are drunk tea,
Tony Crs,
this Tony Syria.
What is this?

2828
02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.330
This is the article about the Churchill gene,
the Churchill Jean.
Oh a church.

2829
02:43:34.331 --> 02:43:37.700
How long has had some in Winston Churchill always had some alcohol under system

2830
02:43:37.730 --> 02:43:40.400
up there but,
but,
but listen to this tone,

2831
02:43:40.401 --> 02:43:45.190
it's urea who Oliver sacks studied basically get struck by lightning all he can

2832
02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:49.630
hear his piano music and becomes a composer and a high level composer and piano

2833
02:43:49.631 --> 02:43:49.871
player.

2834
02:43:49.871 --> 02:43:52.360
Cause all he wanted to do after that was play the piano and it was never an

2835
02:43:52.361 --> 02:43:53.350
instant music.

2836
02:43:53.470 --> 02:43:58.470
So the idea is maybe sometimes a certain things that hit happen to your brain

2837
02:43:58.721 --> 02:44:03.070
can open pathways and channels and circuitry that wasn't,

2838
02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:05.320
that was blocked or wasn't activated before.

2839
02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:07.660
In this case it was a beating and lightning.

2840
02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:12.490
But there are examples of something traumatic happened to someone's brain where

2841
02:44:12.491 --> 02:44:16.920
it opens up an entire new passion and interest in that person and it's,

2842
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:20.050
and that's documented by the late Oliver sacks and a lot of other people.

2843
02:44:20.051 --> 02:44:21.580
That's kind of fascinating.
Well,

2844
02:44:21.581 --> 02:44:26.581
I think that the mind is some sort of a device and this device realize like the

2845
02:44:27.521 --> 02:44:32.521
rest of the body on all the different elements that keep a human being alive.

2846
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:36.730
Human neurotransmitters are flowing around.
There's neurons firing,

2847
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.920
there's all these cells that are alive.

2848
02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:41.290
I mean the mind is just like this fascinating place.

2849
02:44:41.291 --> 02:44:44.560
Now when you introduce things that are psychoactive to the mind,

2850
02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.550
whether it's caffeine,
whether it's new tropics,
whether it's alcohol,

2851
02:44:48.551 --> 02:44:52.570
whether it's teen,
yeah,
sure.
Whether it's marijuana,
there is an effect.

2852
02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:56.470
And when that effect happens is there's a cascade of effects.

2853
02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:00.280
The effect of marijuana,
there's,
there's a lot of different effects,

2854
02:45:00.281 --> 02:45:04.930
but one of them is your creativity absolutely gets kickstart.

2855
02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:08.110
Something happens.
You get a weird way of looking at things.

2856
02:45:08.111 --> 02:45:12.310
You get a strange altered perspective on things.
Um,

2857
02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:16.290
alcohol does the same.
It gives you a strange altered perspective on things,
mate.

2858
02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:19.980
You know,
it doesn't introduce your way,
makes you a little louder.

2859
02:45:19.981 --> 02:45:22.870
It makes you a little bolder releases inhibitions.

2860
02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:27.430
But occasionally someone will write something while on alcohol that is just

2861
02:45:27.431 --> 02:45:29.830
brilliant and they'd comes out of this,

2862
02:45:29.831 --> 02:45:33.970
don't give a fuck thing that alcohol allows you to look at something from a

2863
02:45:33.971 --> 02:45:35.140
different angle.
It's not,

2864
02:45:35.230 --> 02:45:39.460
or maybe or maybe drops your inhibitions and you're able to be more yourself in

2865
02:45:39.461 --> 02:45:42.650
some instances or how's guilty.

2866
02:45:42.670 --> 02:45:46.000
But it's also a possibility that's a combination of those things that they're

2867
02:45:46.001 --> 02:45:48.530
not individual,
that this,
you know,
there's,

2868
02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:53.230
there's not an either or that they're all a part of like most things in life

2869
02:45:53.530 --> 02:45:54.300
that it's,
you know,

2870
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:58.600
it's maybe it quiets down one part of the brain and I'm not mutually exclusive.

2871
02:45:58.630 --> 02:46:03.280
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
listen,
man,
I,
we're learning more and more about science,

2872
02:46:03.281 --> 02:46:04.300
brain science all the time.

2873
02:46:04.301 --> 02:46:08.170
It just shows you not to be too orthodox in their thinking and certainly not too

2874
02:46:08.171 --> 02:46:10.070
judgmental in your thinking.
You know what else to that

2875
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:14.360
<v 2>I think is very important and I've monitored in my own life.</v>

2876
02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:17.600
Um,
I don't have a problem with depression,

2877
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:22.280
but I do have days where I feel better and days where I don't feel as good.

2878
02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:26.750
And a lot of that is dictated by how I choose to think.

2879
02:46:27.350 --> 02:46:29.960
A lot of that is dictated by how I managed my life,

2880
02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:35.200
whether I'm happy with things that I'm doing and how I choose to pursue my

2881
02:46:35.481 --> 02:46:36.740
thinking,
you know?

2882
02:46:36.741 --> 02:46:41.210
And I think there's a certain amount of what that is that makes you feel happy

2883
02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:45.380
and makes you feel sad that is manageable.
And I think too,
there's a,

2884
02:46:45.381 --> 02:46:50.381
there's definitely a danger and putting it all on a disease and all on a pill.

2885
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:54.650
And for some people it most certainly is a disease,

2886
02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:59.480
but there are people that have some wiggle room and their life and they can turn

2887
02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:03.350
their life into a much more positive experience for themselves if they just

2888
02:47:03.351 --> 02:47:05.450
choose to manage it correctly.
There's,

2889
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:10.510
this is not excluding people that have a legit medical condition and have legit

2890
02:47:11.091 --> 02:47:15.140
medical depression and they did some sort of a chemical imbalance.
Not at all,

2891
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:19.760
but I'm saying there was a lot of us that aren't depressed like me that you can

2892
02:47:19.761 --> 02:47:24.230
manipulate the way your mind feels.
You can manipulate the way your,

2893
02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:29.390
your,
your,
your view of the earth is what you choose to focus on.
Yeah.
You know,

2894
02:47:29.391 --> 02:47:33.050
that's 100% true.
You,
you,
you know,
I always think about that.

2895
02:47:33.350 --> 02:47:38.350
How you manage what you choose to think about and the perspective that you take.

2896
02:47:38.570 --> 02:47:42.710
My God,
they've done they,
you know,
anxiety,
behavioral psychologists.

2897
02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.990
We used to always say,
you got to get rid of your anxiety.

2898
02:47:44.991 --> 02:47:49.991
And now what they say is if you think of anxiety in terms of just your body

2899
02:47:50.361 --> 02:47:54.770
getting ready for action as opposed to,
oh no,
this anxiety is going to kill me.

2900
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.960
Your blood vessels look very differently.

2901
02:47:57.140 --> 02:48:01.440
So the how you view your own anxiety and the attitude you take your,

2902
02:48:01.450 --> 02:48:04.310
your blood vessels will either constrict,
which is not good.

2903
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:07.970
But if you look at anxiety,
I,
here I go,
my body's getting ready for this.

2904
02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:08.930
I'm getting ready.

2905
02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:13.250
Your blood vessels and your heart looks exactly the way it does in moments of

2906
02:48:13.251 --> 02:48:18.050
joy and courage.
And that's,
that's fucking great ted talk.
Um,
I again,

2907
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:20.120
I can't remember.
I wish I could tell.
Some people could watch it,

2908
02:48:20.121 --> 02:48:22.880
but really interesting how you look,

2909
02:48:22.881 --> 02:48:27.881
how you choose to think about your own anxiety has everything to do with how,

2910
02:48:28.430 --> 02:48:31.130
whether it's healthy for you or bad for you.

2911
02:48:31.310 --> 02:48:34.940
And if you choose to think about anxiety in the right way,

2912
02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:38.870
there's a lot of evidence,
measurable evidence based on a study that followed,

2913
02:48:38.871 --> 02:48:43.871
I think 30,000 Americans over nine years that suggests that it actually can be

2914
02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:48.400
good for you.
That makes sense if you think about it,
because you're,

2915
02:48:48.401 --> 02:48:52.730
you're shifting what it is and what it becomes is energy and like this,
like,
oh,

2916
02:48:52.731 --> 02:48:55.220
I've got this anxiety,
but you know what?
This is a growth moment.

2917
02:48:55.221 --> 02:48:58.040
This is important.
This means we're getting something done.

2918
02:48:58.041 --> 02:48:59.530
Something is happening in us.

2919
02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:02.150
And and concentrate on least to say that you used to always say,

2920
02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:06.110
I like those moments where I'm not sure what's going to happen next.
Yeah,
I do.

2921
02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:09.960
Very important.
Fucking into luck.
I'm a little too much called adventure.

2922
02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.990
It's called adventure adventure.
It is.

2923
02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:16.830
That's my nickname on knowing what's going to happen next when I like to do is

2924
02:49:16.831 --> 02:49:20.070
run the podcast out to the last five minutes like we're at right now and

2925
02:49:20.071 --> 02:49:23.670
wondering when the tapes going to run out.
Why does it last only three hours?

2926
02:49:23.700 --> 02:49:26.070
It's the fucking Ustream.
If we were on a,

2927
02:49:26.071 --> 02:49:30.660
if we have the balls to switch over to youtube or twitch three hours,

2928
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:33.210
it's enough.
It seems like a good number.

2929
02:49:33.490 --> 02:49:35.310
You know people get mad now when I do too.

2930
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.110
I did two hours yesterday with Ronda Rousey.

2931
02:49:37.111 --> 02:49:39.720
People were complaining they wanted more.
They call me a lazy,
do nothing,

2932
02:49:39.721 --> 02:49:44.040
bitch bastards.
They call me do nothing,
bitch.
I don't really read.

2933
02:49:44.041 --> 02:49:48.090
I don't read any of my hat.
I don't think any of my comments.
Well,
it's dangerous.

2934
02:49:48.210 --> 02:49:51.220
A comic friend of mine was talking shit about me and Brendan and I thought it

2935
02:49:51.221 --> 02:49:55.570
was,
who said his name?
Don't know.
But I walked by,

2936
02:49:55.850 --> 02:49:59.260
but it was surprising.
He's a young guy.
I like,
and he might,

2937
02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:02.790
he might have been misconstrued.
It might've been,
who knows?

2938
02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:08.020
It might be sad.
Might not be happy.
Like am I feel bad?
Might not get no laid.

2939
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.570
Maybe you uh,
Miss Gender.
Tim with the wrong pronoun.
Try here.

2940
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:17.220
Z ladies,
he's gentleman and Zeros here.
You can call them here.

2941
02:50:17.250 --> 02:50:21.180
They're teaching new pronouns.
September 23rd.
Come see me and Joe.

2942
02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:24.980
September 22nd,
come see me and Joe.
You guys have September 23rd.

2943
02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:28.170
Come see me and Joe at the Hong Kong in eight o'clock and 10 o'clock.

2944
02:50:28.171 --> 02:50:29.820
We had an eight o'clock show just now.
Yeah,

2945
02:50:29.821 --> 02:50:32.160
but where can they buy the tickets for that?
Do we know?

2946
02:50:32.190 --> 02:50:35.850
We haven't even advertised.
Yeah,
just go to the Hong Kong in Hong Kong,

2947
02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:40.350
in Hong Kong,
in.com.
The ice hockey tickets are not on sale yet either.

2948
02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:44.370
So calm you can buy,
they'll sell out immediately.
And,
uh,

2949
02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:48.040
this Friday I'm at the car theater.
If you go into the UFC in Vegas,
um,

2950
02:50:48.041 --> 02:50:51.870
at the coffee at her on Friday night with Greg Fitzsimmons and Ian Edwards,

2951
02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:56.100
love both of those guys.
Time Fun.
You fucks.
I'm at the San Jose Improv.

2952
02:50:56.370 --> 02:51:01.050
September 25,
26,
27,
one of my favorite places ever.
That was a beautiful place.

2953
02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:03.270
I've only done it once a while and sit on theater.

2954
02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:07.620
It was an old theater theater and they converted it into a comedy club.

2955
02:51:07.621 --> 02:51:10.140
It's beautiful.
It's one of the best Improv's and the policeman.
Yeah,

2956
02:51:10.141 --> 02:51:13.110
it's awesome.
Awesome.
People can't to.
All right.
You fuckers.

2957
02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:17.580
Thank you very much everybody.
Much love.
Love you all.
Bye Bye.

2958
02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:31.090
<v 6>Yeah.</v>
