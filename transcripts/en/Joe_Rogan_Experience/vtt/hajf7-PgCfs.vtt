00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>So when you were partying,</v>

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
<v Speaker 1>what was your thing?</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Does doing cocaine by myself at the house.</v>

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine.</v>

6
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It was all cocaine.</v>

8
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Dude in cocaine.</v>

10
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh go back to their vest or a man.</v>

11
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happened.</v>

12
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So I would get fucked up and put these vests on and put on sunglasses and not</v>

13
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>let them know like Buffalo Bill Shit,</v>

14
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but at least party and by myself,</v>

15
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up on partying,</v>

17
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.351
<v Speaker 1>live in home.</v>

19
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>The hawkers to vests on maybe.</v>

20
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

21
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.843
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

22
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought I heard something outside.</v>

23
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

24
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going,</v>

25
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>So I leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway,</v>

27
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>lock myself out with the blender,</v>

28
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>going to be 30 in the morning,</v>

29
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>coked up out of my brain and I have to go to my landlord dude who lives right</v>

30
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>down the hall and tell him like,</v>

31
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:55.434
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

32
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I got logged out.</v>

33
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

34
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.301
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

35
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>he must have hated you.</v>

36
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the blender shorts out and smoke happens.</v>

38
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>The fire alarm starts going off in the building,</v>

39
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>right as I'm ad is door knocking right now.</v>

40
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>He's pissed and he's like,</v>

41
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

42
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know what to say.</v>

43
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party.</v>

44
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.654

51
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.050

52
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.883
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

54
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody in there.</v>

55
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.400
