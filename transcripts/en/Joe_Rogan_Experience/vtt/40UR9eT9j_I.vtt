00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And I became aware of you specifically because of your interview with my crazy</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>friend Alex Jones.</v>

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.061
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>

6
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I love Alex Jones.</v>

7
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Alex was great.</v>

8
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He had me on to talk about,</v>

9
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a topic I'm discussing that is,</v>

10
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 2>is difficult to get people to have you on to talk about it because they not Alex</v>

11
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

12
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

13
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:21.744
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

14
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.723
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>

15
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 3>We found more corruption.</v>

16
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this is the insanity of it all.</v>

17
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 2>You have to love his passion.</v>

18
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 2>He's a good friend of mine.</v>

19
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>

20
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>he is so passionate.</v>

22
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 2>And when you follow your passion,</v>

23
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 2>successful following,</v>

24
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.491
<v Speaker 2>that's happened with,</v>

25
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.324
<v Speaker 2>with Alex.</v>

26
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 3>He's so passionate that people think it's fake.</v>

27
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 3>They think that the like,</v>

28
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 3>he's like some sort of a CIA plant and he's like,</v>

29
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

30
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 3>living this lie of,</v>

31
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

32
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 3>it's like the idea of putting up,</v>

33
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I almost wish it was fake that because like I feel,</v>

34
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 3>I always tell them every time I hang out with them,</v>

35
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 3>like you stress me out or just stress like,</v>

36
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 3>like I feel bad for him.</v>

37
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Like he can't calm down.</v>

38
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 3>He's always,</v>

39
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

40
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 3>he's intense when he's eating hot dogs.</v>

41
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 3>need another all fucking hot dog man.</v>

43
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Where's she going with those hot dogs?</v>

44
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

45
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.001
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

46
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

47
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 3>we came with us to the UFC</v>

48
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>great time with that guy.</v>

49
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>He was fun.</v>

50
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.311
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

51
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:09.881
<v Speaker 2>I have to tell you,</v>

52
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 2>after interviewing with him for an hour,</v>

53
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:11.751
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

54
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 2>he's genuine,</v>

55
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 2>genuinely cares about the direction this country is going in and he's willing to</v>

56
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>put his neck out on the line.</v>

57
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.363
<v Speaker 2>Just like you,</v>

59
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.151
<v Speaker 2>you do Joe.</v>

60
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:19.984
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

61
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

62
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's admirable because you're,</v>

63
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing a lot of people just kind of shut up right now.</v>

64
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>It takes the real heroes to really come forward and talk about everything that's</v>

66
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 2>going on or crazy.</v>

67
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>That's when people are freaking out of your mind.</v>

68
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.263
<v Speaker 2>Are you nuts</v>

69
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>for folks who don't know the story,</v>

70
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the story that I got from the Alex Jones show is,</v>

71
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>and this is a subject that I had been really curious about why this wasn't</v>

72
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>receiving any mainstream coverage.</v>

73
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>When we would see all this coverage,</v>

74
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in Syria and all this coverage is going on in Egypt and in</v>

75
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Libya.</v>

76
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.101
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

77
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>we never saw anything on Bahrain.</v>

78
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.671
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

79
00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:00.671
<v Speaker 1>I saw some horrific videos that I found online of just the military</v>

80
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>assassinating dissent,</v>

81
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>assassinating a different people that were protesting.</v>

83
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.141
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

84
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you look at the video and you like,</v>

85
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>how is this not huge?</v>

86
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>How was this not all over the news every day?</v>

87
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>How was,</v>

88
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>how were we not,</v>

89
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>imposing sanctions on his country?</v>

91
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>How are we not,</v>

92
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>speaking out against this horrific show of just,</v>

94
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>it was just horrifying to watch,</v>

95
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird how silent the mainstream news was about it.</v>

96
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was nothing and you ran into this.</v>

97
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

98
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't only run into it,</v>

99
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I was knocked over by it and run over.</v>

100
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

101
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

102
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 1>They just hire you thinking you're a beautiful woman.</v>

103
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>You just want to be like a model who's going to read the news and you're just</v>

104
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>going to shut the fuck up.</v>

105
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

106
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately I'm Greek and I'm a Scorpio and attorney.</v>

107
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.293
<v Speaker 3>Is that good?</v>

109
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>

110
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.483
<v Speaker 3>Super Dangerous.</v>

111
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.581
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they,</v>

112
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think that they knew I wasn't just a talking head puppet when I</v>

113
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:56.541
<v Speaker 2>was hired.</v>

114
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I was actually hired by someone who ended up leaving the network.</v>

115
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

116
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

117
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

118
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>so I think they were surprised.</v>

119
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

120
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

121
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 1>They didn't see it coming</v>

122
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.321
<v Speaker 2>in 10 years.</v>

123
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>If people go back and evaluate the situation though,</v>

124
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.570
<v Speaker 1>they thought you were going to be a female Ryan Seacrest and just run with this.</v>

125
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:16.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird trend,</v>

127
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.540
<v Speaker 1>especially in Fox News,</v>

128
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.730
<v Speaker 1>these gorgeous women reading the news.</v>

129
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

130
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:23.600
<v Speaker 1>that is such a sneaky trick because especially if you're a guy who can't get</v>

131
00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>laid,</v>

132
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.300
<v Speaker 1>like having a beautiful woman talk about anything,</v>

133
00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like I just want to hear her talk.</v>

134
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I just want to just tell him.</v>

135
00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:30.014
<v Speaker 1>He would tell him what's going on.</v>

136
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.220
<v Speaker 1>And so like what better way to program people for your right wing agenda then</v>

137
00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:35.870
<v Speaker 1>have like the hottest chicks in the planet.</v>

138
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what's wrong with the left</v>

139
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 2>and then also have them say weapons of mass destruction.</v>

140
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

141
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

142
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>And it worked.</v>

143
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.131
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

144
00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:50.210
<v Speaker 2>obviously we ended up in Iraq and Afghanistan and they're continuing to bleed</v>

145
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the hot chips.</v>

146
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Propaganda is strong for sure.</v>

147
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Well tell us your experience cause you,</v>

148
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you know better than anyone.</v>

149
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>You were working on CNN.</v>

150
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I saw some of the other stuff that you did.</v>

151
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing though.</v>

152
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Especially the theme of the piece on the child prostitutes in Las Vegas.</v>

153
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So you watched that.</v>

154
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It was hard.</v>

155
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I felt for that mom.</v>

156
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It was so horrible seeing that mom holding one baby,</v>

157
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>talking about her other baby who's now 13 and is just running around as a</v>

158
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:18.581
<v Speaker 1>prostitute.</v>

159
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.361
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

160
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It was insane to watch.</v>

161
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>So I know you did serious work for them and that's like,</v>

162
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that was some really deep shit and it was a long piece.</v>

163
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>What is it like to,</v>

164
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 1>to go from that to just running into this wall and this one particular subject</v>

165
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that set you off this Bahrain issue.</v>

166
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that like?</v>

167
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>It works well for me it was really disturbing.</v>

168
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

169
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.993
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

170
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>horrific because I knew these people in Bahrain were being tortured and abused</v>

171
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.220
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

172
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>and systematically killed and doctors can be killing doctors.</v>

173
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Doctors are taking care of people who protested,</v>

174
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 2>who got shot for the,</v>

175
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 2>for treating these people.</v>

176
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 2>They got tortured.</v>

177
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

178
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>they got tortured.</v>

179
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are still in jail.</v>

180
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>These are genuinely good people.</v>

181
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>A ambulance drivers were beat journalists.</v>

182
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.831
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

183
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>one was arrested,</v>

184
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 2>his body showed up a couple of days later,</v>

185
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 2>just full of,</v>

186
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 2>of torture marks.</v>

187
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

188
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.560
<v Speaker 2>and what really bothered me is because I grew up in the Midwest and I know how</v>

189
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 2>the American people get taken advantage of and our tax dollars are going to this</v>

190
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 2>bar brain regime to support them.</v>

191
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>And they're the ones doing this to their people.</v>

192
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 2>How much money do we send to Bahrain?</v>

193
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Every year we send a,</v>

194
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

195
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact amount of money,</v>

196
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 2>but I know that we send more than a billion dollars worth of weapons.</v>

197
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>We've given them more than a billion dollars worth of a weapons.</v>

198
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 2>They're using some of these weapons,</v>

199
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:40.200
<v Speaker 2>some of this tear gas that they're using to systematically gas their people,</v>

200
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 2>which they are doing.</v>

201
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 2>They're taking weapons that they're allowed to use,</v>

202
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 2>which is tear gas and bird shot.</v>

203
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:47.550
<v Speaker 2>And instead of using those for crowd control,</v>

204
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:51.180
<v Speaker 2>they're using those to systematically kill their people and gas them.</v>

205
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And this is being made in Pennsylvania with tear gas.</v>

206
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

207
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 2>they're there because it's you and approve.</v>

208
00:05:56.881 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 2>So literally dropping tear gas on these villages every single day,</v>

209
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>all day long and night.</v>

210
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And Physicians for Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize winning organization has</v>

211
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>been trying to raise hell about this because it's,</v>

212
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it's tearing up these people's lungs.</v>

213
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 2>People who are as Madec are dying,</v>

214
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>elderly are dying,</v>

215
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>they're suffocating in their homes and they're misusing this gas and it's a very</v>

216
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>systematic way that they're doing it.</v>

217
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 2>People are having miscarriages,</v>

218
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:20.864
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

219
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.201
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

220
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 2>some of these doctors are now connecting it to the tear gas.</v>

221
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

222
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.561
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

223
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>so this is something that needs to be talked about urgently because these people</v>

224
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>as I speak right now,</v>

225
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.360
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

226
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 2>they're being guests.</v>

227
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.400
<v Speaker 1>How many people have died from this so far?</v>

228
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

229
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>so far they don't know it because they can't a hundred percent,</v>

230
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

231
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 2>say you were gassed in a couple of days later,</v>

233
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you die because you have a respiratory issues.</v>

234
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't 100% connected to the gas,</v>

235
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 2>but so far more than a couple dozen people have been killed</v>

236
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>and they just continually do this.</v>

237
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You continually all day long.</v>

238
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a way,</v>

240
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a way that they're trying to suppress the protests also a way that they're</v>

241
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

242
00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>to silence the opposition and get people in these and these neighborhoods to</v>

244
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>convince the youth to quit protesting because they keep getting gassed.</v>

245
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

246
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 2>as a result of it.</v>

247
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.740
<v Speaker 1>What is our business there?</v>

248
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Speaker 1>What is our business with Paul Ryan that we support them?</v>

249
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.471
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

250
00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:14.940
<v Speaker 2>this means everything to us right now.</v>

251
00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people will say,</v>

252
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:16.081
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

253
00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Bahrain is so far away.</v>

254
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 2>What does it matter to me?</v>

255
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I always explain this to my sister because she's in that mindset.</v>

256
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:23.460
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't really know about the politics in the region.</v>

257
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.351
<v Speaker 2>Well we,</v>

258
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:27.630
<v Speaker 2>we keep hearing more and more about Iran and a potential war with Iran.</v>

259
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>So we need,</v>

260
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>we have a navy base in Bahrain,</v>

261
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 2>in Bahrain is right across a,</v>

262
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a body of water separating bufferin and Iran.</v>

263
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So we need that naval base if we're going to go in and eventually attack you,</v>

264
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.001
<v Speaker 2>Ron.</v>

265
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:43.050
<v Speaker 2>It's very strategic for the u s that's why we have buffering as an ally.</v>

266
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

267
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>and so this situation is a situation where the u s is giving Bob Crane money and</v>

268
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 2>keeping our base there and allowing these atrocities to happen because of a</v>

269
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.880
<v Speaker 2>potential war with Iran.</v>

270
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:54.151
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

271
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 2>so your tax dollars are going directly to this regime.</v>

272
00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:58.134
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

273
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 2>covering up the story further gets us into some,</v>

274
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:01.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:06.570
<v Speaker 2>potential conflict with Iran because you're not knowing.</v>

276
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.540
<v Speaker 2>We're demonizing people who we want to attack.</v>

277
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:10.041
<v Speaker 2>And then we're,</v>

278
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.940
<v Speaker 2>we're praising people who we want to keep as our,</v>

279
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.803
<v Speaker 2>as our allies,</v>

280
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.590
<v Speaker 1>who we really should probably should be attacking.</v>

281
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

282
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.370
<v Speaker 1>If people knew we wanted to stop atrocities in the world,</v>

283
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be looking at a run.</v>

284
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You'd be looking at fucking ball ranch.</v>

285
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.431
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

286
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:22.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

287
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>we were detained violently there.</v>

288
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 2>We were thrown on the ground.</v>

289
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 2>We had machine guns pointed at our heads and they tried to erase all of our</v>

290
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

291
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

292
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.280
<v Speaker 2>and this was about 10 a 10 minutes drive from the naval base worth.</v>

293
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 2>15,000 Americans are living and um,</v>

294
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>and they tried to,</v>

296
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

297
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 2>to bury the story.</v>

298
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:40.481
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

299
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 2>but fortunately I was with another female producer.</v>

300
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 2>We were able to hide these,</v>

301
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>these media discs actually in our,</v>

302
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 2>in our bras during the detainment.</v>

303
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

304
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

305
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>now that I look back on it,</v>

306
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.084
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of funny,</v>

307
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 2>but at the time we were very worried about that.</v>

308
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>The discs falling out is you're laying on the ground and you have a gun pointed</v>

309
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>at your head and erasing your video.</v>

310
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that just to drop out on the floor.</v>

311
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you say to them?</v>

312
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.081
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>

313
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

314
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.583
<v Speaker 2>I came from,</v>

315
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 2>none of my tits</v>

316
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.383
<v Speaker 2>actually got,</v>

317
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>so it was a,</v>

319
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 2>it was a situation that was just pretty eyeopening.</v>

320
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.891
<v Speaker 2>That's intense.</v>

321
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And you tried to go back.</v>

322
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

323
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

324
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I've tried many times.</v>

325
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 2>They won't let me back.</v>

326
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>You go back after that because you find a connection to this story as a</v>

327
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 2>journalist when you know something's happening,</v>

328
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

329
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

330
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:28.411
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

331
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:29.244
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

332
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.953
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

333
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

334
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>the people are really good people.</v>

335
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.771
<v Speaker 2>When you meet them,</v>

336
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:35.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

337
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 2>you just remember them.</v>

338
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

339
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you hold a,</v>

340
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

341
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 2>a big place in your heart for them and,</v>

342
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 2>and for,</v>

343
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

344
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 2>for their survival and,</v>

345
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 2>and you feel duty to tell their story.</v>

346
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>What is it about the Middle East that makes these crazy dictators?</v>

347
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

348
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>that's really the last place in the world were due to still rocking it.</v>

349
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Old School like that where there's like a king running a whole country.</v>

350
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>There's only the Middle East.</v>

351
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fascinating when you look at human history and you find out that</v>

352
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>that's where the original civilization,</v>

353
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>the oldest known civilization as soon mirror,</v>

354
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>that's where Iraq is.</v>

355
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.311
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

356
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>so those people that are,</v>

357
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially the townies of the world.</v>

358
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like people in the Middle East are like these dictators.</v>

359
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean they really are running things the way they did thousands of years ago.</v>

360
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>They have never had to evolve.</v>

361
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They've never had to move on like the rest of the world has.</v>

362
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think we can even wrap our heads around the idea of kings in this</v>

363
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:27.271
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

364
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like it seems,</v>

365
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>even though as our police state clamps down on our rights starts slipping away</v>

366
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>every day with the more of these insane bills at pass,</v>

367
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I still don't think we understand what it would be like to be under the rule of</v>

368
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein and having his Uday Day and whatever the,</v>

369
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>his other sons name this crazy evil psychopaths,</v>

370
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>sons running around torturing and killing people.</v>

371
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can even understand that.</v>

372
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that's almost outside of our range.</v>

373
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So as long as something like this about rain isn't reported on,</v>

374
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not talked about in the news.</v>

375
00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to focus on it.</v>

376
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

377
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>we don't really,</v>

378
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.983
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

379
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't register with us</v>

380
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:02.911
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

381
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.360
<v Speaker 2>and we're keeping them in power.</v>

382
00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 2>We're keeping these dictators in power.</v>

383
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's another thing that I don't think,</v>

384
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:08.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

385
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.603
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

386
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.270
<v Speaker 2>our current government wants us to discuss because they don't want the people to</v>

387
00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 2>be outraged and make us leave.</v>

388
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.700
<v Speaker 2>And they don't want this protest to succeed because if the protest succeed,</v>

389
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.950
<v Speaker 2>these protesters are going to kick the u s out.</v>

390
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:21.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

391
00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:25.720
<v Speaker 2>the u s has a aided this regime and,</v>

392
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.820
<v Speaker 2>and oppressing them for decades and,</v>

393
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.631
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

394
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:34.030
<v Speaker 2>so that's another reason the US doesn't want this reported on in the mainstream</v>

395
00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:34.864
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

396
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

397
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy because I guess the idea is by not have taking military action</v>

398
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 1>against someone like that,</v>

399
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

400
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:42.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

402
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>what are you just turning a blind eye to it or what do you,</v>

403
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

404
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:46.501
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

405
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>how do you continue to,</v>

406
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.330
<v Speaker 1>how did you know,</v>

407
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 1>send them weapons?</v>

408
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>

409
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.853
<v Speaker 1>It seems,</v>

410
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>it just seems unconscionable.</v>

411
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a,</v>

412
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point in time,</v>

413
00:11:56.351 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>someone has to cross some line somewhere and just go,</v>

414
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:00.551
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

415
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:00.851
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

416
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>what exactly are we doing?</v>

417
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Like is it really that important to go into Iran that were allowing this country</v>

418
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:06.971
<v Speaker 1>to run like this?</v>

419
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

420
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.910
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

421
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>why are we supporting this?</v>

422
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we doing as a country?</v>

423
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Are we completely about dollar bills now?</v>

424
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it just about controlling oil ports and,</v>

425
00:12:15.181 --> 00:12:15.511
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

426
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:15.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

427
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>and pathways?</v>

428
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:16.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

429
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 1>that's really what the Iran thing is about,</v>

430
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

431
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's about controlling the,</v>

432
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>about being able to get oil out of a,</v>

433
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:23.711
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

434
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

435
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that shipping route yes.</v>

436
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

437
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

438
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's about,</v>

439
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 2>it's about exactly.</v>

440
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.101
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>

441
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 2>don't let people lie to you and tell you it's about,</v>

442
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 2>they're worried about human rights abuses in any Ron because look what we're</v>

443
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 2>doing in buffering in order to potentially attack you,</v>

444
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:43.111
<v Speaker 2>run where we're helping them oppress hundreds of thousands of people on a daily</v>

445
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

446
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

447
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 2>so if we really cared about human rights,</v>

448
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't,</v>

449
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.540
<v Speaker 2>we would have left buffering a long time ago.</v>

450
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.230
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't be sending them weapons</v>

451
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>be in Mexico when,</v>

452
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

453
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.900
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

454
00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:54.241
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

455
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:55.940
<v Speaker 2>and we're being an a and once again,</v>

456
00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:56.151
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

457
00:12:56.151 --> 00:13:00.800
<v Speaker 2>this goes back to the American public being lied to systematically by the media.</v>

458
00:13:00.801 --> 00:13:02.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real shame.</v>

459
00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I think so many people say,</v>

460
00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:08.390
<v Speaker 2>oh well the Americans are stupid and they don't know what's going on and know</v>

461
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:10.790
<v Speaker 2>it's Americans are being fed lies constantly,</v>

462
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 2>all day long and,</v>

463
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and it really needs to stop.</v>

464
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

465
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:14.831
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

466
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.664
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame.</v>

467
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Now you were there,</v>

468
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you're inside,</v>

469
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 1>you're on CNN now.</v>

470
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 1>What was it that you wanted to report on that you couldn't,</v>

471
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:23.801
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

472
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>the exact censorship?</v>

473
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 1>What did they tell you what you could or couldn't say about it?</v>

474
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

475
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

476
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:30.710
<v Speaker 2>what happened was once I got back from Bahrain,</v>

477
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

478
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 2>they were surprised when obviously the Bahrain regime,</v>

479
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>when we started airing this video,</v>

480
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 2>cause we were able to sneak out with the video.</v>

481
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 2>They thought that they had erased all of our video.</v>

482
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.461
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

483
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:41.140
<v Speaker 2>and so we started hearing these stories.</v>

484
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And at first it was great.</v>

485
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 2>CNN was letting us air all of these.</v>

486
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

487
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and that was for,</v>

488
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.191
<v Speaker 2>about a week or so.</v>

490
00:13:47.191 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to get coverage on.</v>

491
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>But then Barbara and started calling and complaining and their PR companies,</v>

492
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 2>they pay US citizens and US PR companies to do PR for them.</v>

493
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.621
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

494
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 2>the people can't afford that,</v>

495
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 2>but of course the regime can.</v>

496
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.183
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

497
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

498
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

499
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>eventually three months later,</v>

500
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:06.370
<v Speaker 2>we finished our documentary and we found out that it wasn't going to be airing</v>

501
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 2>on CNN international.</v>

502
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It aired once on CNN,</v>

503
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.183
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

504
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 2>but never on CNN international to the target audience,</v>

505
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

506
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 2>is the most,</v>

507
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

508
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>the most viewed English news station in the region.</v>

509
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.721
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

510
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>we need these people needed to see this documentary.</v>

512
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And it was an airing.</v>

513
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

514
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and I've had documentaries.</v>

515
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:25.901
<v Speaker 2>I've done at CNN,</v>

516
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:26.191
<v Speaker 2>the dinner,</v>

517
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:26.501
<v Speaker 2>Aaron,</v>

518
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 2>CNN international,</v>

519
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>but this entire documentary was shot overseas.</v>

520
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.100
<v Speaker 2>And what really got me was my bosses directly above me were,</v>

521
00:14:34.101 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>were dumbfounded.</v>

522
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>We would have phone calls and emails and people said,</v>

523
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this is an hearing.</v>

524
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on.</v>

525
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

526
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 2>my producers were very,</v>

527
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>very upset.</v>

528
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

529
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 2>they had risks are lives to tell this story.</v>

530
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Our sources had risked their lives to tell CNN their story.</v>

531
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

532
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 2>one guys who for Doctors Without Borders has house was burnt down after he</v>

533
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 2>talked with us.</v>

534
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

535
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

536
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.071
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

537
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean in our main source and the documentary,</v>

538
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 2>he's in prison right now.</v>

539
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 2>His mom just died yesterday and he didn't even get to say goodbye to her.</v>

540
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Nabeel Rajab,</v>

541
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 2>he's in prison for the next three years and he's a peace activist who has a</v>

542
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 2>picture of Gandhi on his cell phone.</v>

543
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

544
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 2>and so all of these sources that helped us film this documentary or punished and</v>

545
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:18.020
<v Speaker 2>harassed for helping CNN.</v>

546
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And so we still couldn't believe why they had an aired it on CNN international.</v>

547
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

548
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>and so I kept getting people writing me and calling me and telling me,</v>

549
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you need to look into this.</v>

550
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 2>There's something going on here.</v>

551
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.350
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

552
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

553
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a much bigger story.</v>

554
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And seeing as how I don't have a family and you know,</v>

555
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:38.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm not tied down to a retirement plan or I really could give a crap about,</v>

556
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 2>about the money.</v>

557
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

558
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I started looking into it and realizing the brain's actually a paying customer</v>

559
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.983
<v Speaker 2>at CNN.</v>

560
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 2>They are literally paying the network for programming.</v>

561
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

562
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>journalistically.</v>

563
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if a lot of people out there listening know about journalistic</v>

564
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.991
<v Speaker 2>ethics,</v>

565
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 2>but we're supposed to be watchdogs on government.</v>

566
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 2>We are not supposed to accept money from them.</v>

567
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Not only accepting money.</v>

568
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

569
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that's different if you accept money and you air a commercial.</v>

570
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 2>But they're actually airing our long programs on CNN,</v>

571
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 2>paid for by the buffering regime,</v>

572
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:10.701
<v Speaker 2>not only Bob rain,</v>

573
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:11.451
<v Speaker 2>we're talking Georgia,</v>

574
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Kazakhstan and other,</v>

575
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.533
<v Speaker 2>other regimes.</v>

577
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 2>And this has been going on for decades and it bothers me cause people are being</v>

578
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:19.514
<v Speaker 2>lied to.</v>

579
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's just paid propaganda programming unit for propaganda.</v>

580
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.660
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being the news,</v>

581
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.690
<v Speaker 1>they're there select pieces of information that these governments want Americans</v>

582
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and whoever watches CNN to see.</v>

583
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:33.820
<v Speaker 1>So they pay them for it.</v>

584
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

585
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>they pay illegal.</v>

586
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Well journalistically it's,</v>

587
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

588
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

589
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

590
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 2>if there were a journalist's police,</v>

591
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I would arrest them.</v>

592
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

593
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.883
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

594
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>it is legal,</v>

595
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but is it right?</v>

596
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

597
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.470
<v Speaker 2>because when the air,</v>

598
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>some of these programs,</v>

599
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:48.831
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

600
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 2>they don't let the viewers know that that's paid for by the government.</v>

601
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:53.661
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

602
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 1>When you watch like one of those wacky fake talk shows where they're selling a</v>

603
00:16:57.531 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 1>blender,</v>

604
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 1>they have to tell you this is a paid infomercial.</v>

605
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.560
<v Speaker 1>They have to tell you when this,</v>

606
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.260
<v Speaker 1>this blender guys in his talk show,</v>

607
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:04.851
<v Speaker 1>so showing,</v>

608
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:05.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>how you make cucumbers slice real easy and stuff.</v>

610
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.810
<v Speaker 1>They have to tell you,</v>

611
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 1>why don't they have to tell you that on CNN?</v>

612
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>That seems way more important than the fucking blender.</v>

613
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:13.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

614
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:15.780
<v Speaker 2>exactly because it's shaping our foreign policy.</v>

615
00:17:15.781 --> 00:17:16.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

616
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:19.320
<v Speaker 2>they're feeding the American public this propaganda so that they think</v>

617
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:24.321
<v Speaker 2>everything's rosy and happy in Bahrain when really the situation there is,</v>

618
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:26.460
<v Speaker 2>is horrific.</v>

619
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at one of these programs,</v>

620
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you can youtube it.</v>

621
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.080
<v Speaker 2>It's called I list Bob Rain.</v>

622
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.150
<v Speaker 2>They have their host Richard Quest.</v>

623
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.310
<v Speaker 2>They have him live at the race track for a week in Bahrain talking about how</v>

624
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.710
<v Speaker 2>wonderful the country is and how progressive it is.</v>

625
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 2>And he interviews the crown prince and calls him a reformer.</v>

626
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.430
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same crown prince who was in empower when troops shot and killed</v>

627
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 2>and broad daylight,</v>

628
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.120
<v Speaker 2>these tanks to shot out into a,</v>

629
00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:56.200
<v Speaker 2>a crowd of protesters and just killed them in broad day light.</v>

630
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.731
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>

631
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 2>the prince that two years earlier,</v>

632
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 2>CNN was telling the public was great,</v>

633
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 2>was progressive of reformer.</v>

634
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.181
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

635
00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 2>and it's not fair to the public when you watch these,</v>

636
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 2>the disclosures are so minimal or they're not even there if you go on youtube,</v>

637
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:09.961
<v Speaker 2>the videos,</v>

638
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

640
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's not fair to not only seen as journalists to our sources,</v>

641
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

642
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but to the people watching because they don't know they're getting propaganda.</v>

643
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So this has been going on for decades.</v>

644
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>For decades.</v>

645
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had real news.</v>

646
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:28.260
<v Speaker 1>We've had a mixture of some real news and some bullshit that's paid for by other</v>

647
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

648
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.453
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

649
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Look up,</v>

650
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

651
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I list bufferin commercial and you can watch the whole commercial.</v>

652
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see not once in the commercial that's like progressive,</v>

653
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.550
<v Speaker 2>fabulous new this week we're talking about buffering,</v>

654
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

655
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.511
<v Speaker 2>it never says,</v>

656
00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:46.790
<v Speaker 2>and then commercial that this is paid for by buffering and,</v>

657
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.491
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>

658
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:49.470
<v Speaker 2>that's not fair to the people.</v>

659
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:49.831
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

660
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair to view beyond creepy.</v>

661
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 2>How big is Bahrain?</v>

662
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Bahrain is about the size.</v>

663
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Bahrain is small.</v>

664
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It's about the size of San Francisco.</v>

665
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Population wise,</v>

666
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.220
<v Speaker 1>you can't say Bahrain every time.</v>

667
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

668
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Not going to say Bahrain.</v>

669
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:03.891
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain.</v>

670
00:19:03.891 --> 00:19:04.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

671
00:19:04.421 --> 00:19:05.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean?</v>

672
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:06.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those words,</v>

673
00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:08.060
<v Speaker 1>like if you commit to saying it correctly every time,</v>

674
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.913
<v Speaker 1>how do you spell it?</v>

675
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

676
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.651
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>

677
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:09.891
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

678
00:19:09.891 --> 00:19:10.760
<v Speaker 2>h r a,</v>

679
00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I n and m and also we can,</v>

680
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you can see a video of these protests.</v>

681
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>They're insane.</v>

682
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.200
<v Speaker 2>You watch them and you just see miles of people protesting and,</v>

683
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.510
<v Speaker 2>and then you really realize this is a true revolution they're trying to have</v>

684
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:23.781
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

685
00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's being oppressed by the United States.</v>

686
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

687
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.251
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

688
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.390
<v Speaker 2>if the people get in power,</v>

689
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>they're going to kick the U s out there.</v>

690
00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Very upset because the US has,</v>

691
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.180
<v Speaker 2>has kept a regime in power for them.</v>

692
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So we're helping this creepy fuck by giving them $1 billion worth of weapons use</v>

693
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.400
<v Speaker 1>tear gassing people to death.</v>

694
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

695
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

696
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:41.941
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

697
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:42.721
<v Speaker 2>and not only that,</v>

698
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 2>they're systematically getting it off the,</v>

699
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the news in the u s as what happens to me it was,</v>

700
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

701
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.890
<v Speaker 2>it became nearly impossible to cut through the red tape.</v>

702
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

703
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 1>this is really disturbing.</v>

704
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>If you had any hope whatsoever that we were going to avoid some sort of conflict</v>

705
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:59.060
<v Speaker 1>with Iran because it seems like that it's just there they are dead set on it.</v>

706
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why another reason I came forward urgently and cause this is about much</v>

707
00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>more than Bahrain and the systematic cover up of what's happening about rain</v>

708
00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:08.090
<v Speaker 2>only tells you what's,</v>

709
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 2>what's potentially going to happen in the future and,</v>

710
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:10.561
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

711
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:11.750
<v Speaker 2>and in the near future.</v>

712
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:12.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's uh,</v>

713
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.130
<v Speaker 2>an attack on Iran or potentially some people,</v>

714
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:16.271
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

715
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:20.210
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the far side who have really analyzed this could say this could</v>

716
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:22.010
<v Speaker 2>potentially become a world war three,</v>

717
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

718
00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's all just to control the oil,</v>

719
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

720
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

721
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.790
<v Speaker 1>is that what's it's about?</v>

722
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:28.624
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

723
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.700
<v Speaker 1>it's just a control oil and it's just,</v>

724
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.170
<v Speaker 1>this is the way they've always done it.</v>

725
00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to continue to do it this way,</v>

726
00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:37.360
<v Speaker 1>even though now people are paying attention finally for the first time in human</v>

727
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

728
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

729
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:38.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

730
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 2>they're going to tell you if you talk to people who are very pro Israel,</v>

731
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

732
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

733
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.411
<v Speaker 2>and once again,</v>

734
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an opinion on,</v>

735
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>on any of that area.</v>

736
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I try to cover objectively,</v>

737
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:47.921
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

738
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I've covered stories in the West Bank and in Israel,</v>

739
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to tell you that Iran,</v>

740
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:52.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

741
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:53.501
<v Speaker 2>often deny.</v>

742
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 2>God said he will wipe Israel off the map and they're going to repeat that over</v>

743
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:00.370
<v Speaker 2>and over because that's there for ward propaganda that they're going to start</v>

744
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 2>feeding to you.</v>

745
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>And they already have for years.</v>

746
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.911
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>

747
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:07.130
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to that speech that they're referring to aqua dinners,</v>

748
00:21:07.131 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd never said that it was miss translated,</v>

749
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 2>but instead they rolled with that in the u s media has continued to roll with</v>

750
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:13.391
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

751
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:13.631
<v Speaker 2>Watch.</v>

752
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Erin Burnett show.</v>

753
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

754
00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:15.921
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the,</v>

755
00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:16.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

756
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.150
<v Speaker 1>the original one.</v>

757
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:17.221
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

758
00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:18.440
<v Speaker 1>when it's translated correctly,</v>

759
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:19.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different meaning.</v>

760
00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:21.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that we were w but it was,</v>

761
00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't nice,</v>

762
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't the same thing.</v>

763
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.403
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

764
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in response to if Israel attacked Iran,</v>

765
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:29.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we would wipe them off the map or something along those lines.</v>

767
00:21:31.611 --> 00:21:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't,</v>

768
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that it was Maura.</v>

769
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

770
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that he,</v>

771
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:35.770
<v Speaker 2>they want the regime out of Israel.</v>

772
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 2>They want that government out.</v>

773
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It was more a rhetorical then than physically,</v>

774
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:42.190
<v Speaker 2>like we want to go in and murder you all and kill you.</v>

775
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It was more w we want you to be,</v>

776
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.423
<v Speaker 2>be kicked out of office.</v>

777
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.700
<v Speaker 1>So we sort of have acquainted it to like Khrushchev banging his heel,</v>

778
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 1>saying we will bury you like that.</v>

780
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.660
<v Speaker 1>That sort of a thing that's like,</v>

781
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.461
<v Speaker 1>so we've,</v>

782
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 1>we've decided to run with that is the big threat.</v>

783
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

784
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.391
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

785
00:21:57.391 --> 00:21:59.760
<v Speaker 2>And they say it's as if Iran gets a nuke,</v>

786
00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 2>they're going to send it right in and wipe Israel off the map.</v>

787
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:03.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they're trying to use that for.</v>

788
00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 2>And everyone needs to pay attention.</v>

789
00:22:04.861 --> 00:22:05.161
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

790
00:22:05.161 --> 00:22:06.360
<v Speaker 2>it is propaganda.</v>

791
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.030
<v Speaker 2>It is forward.</v>

792
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just like weapons of mass destruction.</v>

793
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I see them now,</v>

794
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.630
<v Speaker 2>now that I've been in inside,</v>

795
00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I know how they start feeding propaganda and this is exactly what they're doing</v>

796
00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:16.890
<v Speaker 2>was saying,</v>

797
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:17.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

798
00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 2>it will be,</v>

799
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Ron's going to wipe Israel off the map so we need to go in and attack and,</v>

800
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

801
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:22.801
<v Speaker 2>and guys,</v>

802
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:23.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

803
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:26.820
<v Speaker 2>this could potentially get us into a conflict with much,</v>

804
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

805
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.660
<v Speaker 2>more permanent and damning implications than,</v>

806
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.340
<v Speaker 2>than Iraq and Afghanistan ever,</v>

807
00:22:32.341 --> 00:22:33.174
<v Speaker 2>ever wore.</v>

808
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:33.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

809
00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:35.390
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this would be huge.</v>

810
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.720
<v Speaker 1>This would be much bigger if we actually went into Iran.</v>

811
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.421
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

812
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it's another level of civilization above what was going on in Afghanistan and in</v>

813
00:22:42.831 --> 00:22:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and theirs does no reason for it.</v>

814
00:22:45.171 --> 00:22:46.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

815
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way the rest of the world is going to tolerate it.</v>

816
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be,</v>

817
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.713
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be chaos.</v>

818
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:53.250
<v Speaker 2>We have Russia and China to worry about as well.</v>

820
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>If we go in and,</v>

821
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:54.871
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

822
00:22:54.871 --> 00:22:55.704
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

823
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.210
<v Speaker 2>and Lord knows what can happen from there.</v>

824
00:22:57.211 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I just hope that the American people realize that there they are being fed</v>

825
00:23:00.121 --> 00:23:01.650
<v Speaker 2>propaganda with,</v>

826
00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:04.890
<v Speaker 2>with the Iran situation now in the same people behind Iraq,</v>

827
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.690
<v Speaker 2>same forces are behind this push to get us in Iran.</v>

828
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.703
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

829
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:18.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
