124
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:22.251

<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

128
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Because you decided one day on a critical night to make this guide,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if that was possible?</v>

134
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Just stop and think for a second.</v>

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:42.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>is that going to turn into a mansion that well,</v>

149
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.571
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

150
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the crazy thing is I think there was something nutty.</v>

151
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Like she was born with no vagina.</v>

152
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It was like the whole thing was a freak show.</v>

153
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It was in Africa and I think I might be making this up.</v>

154
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I think she was born with,</v>

155
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

156
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.431
<v Speaker 1>I remember this.</v>

157
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I was born with no vagina and she just run around.</v>

158
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I just guess given Dude's head,</v>

159
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>the poor young thing,</v>

160
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like the birth of a comic book heroes,</v>

161
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>he was born in Africa to a woman would know vagina from a gash in her over at</v>

162
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

163
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that the most like no one can talk shit.</v>

164
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're from that situation when you're at school,</v>

165
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.141
<v Speaker 1>you know you could,</v>

166
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:41.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:41.861
<v Speaker 1>kids can be like,</v>

168
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:42.694
<v Speaker 1>my dad's a cop,</v>

169
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.931
<v Speaker 1>and the guys would be like,</v>

171
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>my dad is a fireman and he be like,</v>

172
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

173
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>no one knows.</v>

174
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>She was just sucking dicks and some loads survived and someone stabbed her.</v>

175
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't even have a vagina.</v>

176
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>There was no exit for that.</v>

177
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Learn God.</v>

178
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking shitty roll the dice.</v>

179
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>If you really believe in Karma and you really believe that you are the product</v>

180
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>of your past lives and who you are and what you,</v>

181
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>what you learned in those lives and it's carrying over.</v>

182
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I know not everyone is equal.</v>

183
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did that guy do?</v>

184
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:12.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

186
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and also like who is this vaginalis,</v>

187
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>blowjob port girl.</v>

188
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.173
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

189
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>The poor girl.</v>

190
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>What a shit roll the dice man who is,</v>

191
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>who is that girl?</v>

193
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>What was she in another life?</v>

194
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

195
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.641
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

196
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like it,</v>

197
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

198
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the big questions is because if you do believe in Karma,</v>

199
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>then you have to like,</v>

200
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like people use that as a way to like not,</v>

201
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>not accept the universe as being like a really brutal place.</v>

202
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I get mad when people pretend that they think they know how this thing works.</v>

203
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

204
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>someone was trying to talk to me about Karma and he was talking to me about how</v>

205
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't worry about crime ever.</v>

206
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.851
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

207
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.091
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

208
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.301
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

209
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>because I just feel like if you don't put that out there,</v>

210
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't come back at you.</v>

211
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:55.271
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

212
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.104
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

213
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.381
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

214
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>babies and bys explain it.</v>

215
00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.840
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

216
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 3>The baby putting that out there,</v>

217
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.123
<v Speaker 3>is that what's going on?</v>

218
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 3>The babies putting that out there and the baby gets shot.</v>

219
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Listen motherfucker,</v>

220
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>this random shit that goes down.</v>

221
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.291
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

222
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

223
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.670
<v Speaker 3>just because you might have control over your immediate environment most of the</v>

224
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 3>time doesn't mean it's not,</v>

225
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 3>the world's chaos man,</v>

227
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:16.911
<v Speaker 3>he can't tell me,</v>

228
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's like why the secret was so offensive to a lot of people.</v>

230
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what all that was going on.</v>

231
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you're telling me that all diseases and everything that people will,</v>

232
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 3>those on themselves really for real.</v>

233
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:27.651
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

234
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.011
<v Speaker 3>So much.</v>

235
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Someone wills having a foot grown out of the fucking head so people will,</v>

236
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 3>twins that are stuck together at the brain and share one skull.</v>

238
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

239
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.851
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

240
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weak thing because it kind of,</v>

241
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the end result of that is it's like,</v>

242
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 3>so when I'm at the beach and I'm walking down the beach and I turn and look at</v>

243
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 3>the miserable woman pushing her baby,</v>

244
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 3>who's obviously like severely mentally retarded in that baby's got tubes in its</v>

245
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:57.491
<v Speaker 3>mouth and it's like [inaudible] like I'm supposed to look at that kid and think</v>

246
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 3>you're getting yours.</v>

247
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 3>You getting what you deserve from the universe because in a past life,</v>

248
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

249
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.053
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

250
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.313
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

251
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Empathy and compassion for that kid.</v>

252
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of be like,</v>

253
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.011
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

254
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:10.844
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

255
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 3>he deserved that.</v>

256
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

257
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 3>There there's,</v>

258
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 3>there appears to be a lot of randomness,</v>

259
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

260
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of randomness.</v>

261
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

262
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

263
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 3>you can't put your finger on it either way.</v>

264
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:20.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

265
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 3>we might be wrong.</v>

266
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 3>It might really be that simple.</v>

267
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 3>It might really be that person did something incredibly fucked up in another</v>

268
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

269
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.641
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

270
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.474
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know,</v>

271
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 3>but it just doesn't seem like that's a nice way to think.</v>

272
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.871
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

273
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's awesome.</v>

274
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.663
<v Speaker 3>Kind of a real,</v>

275
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 3>you know how like people who say if you talk to someone is like I don't believe</v>

276
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:35.821
<v Speaker 3>in God.</v>

277
00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 3>And then you ask them what their definition of God is.</v>

278
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Then quite often the god they don't believe in,</v>

279
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't believe in because it's like the guy with the beard and the</v>

280
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever and the Toga.</v>

281
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>

282
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 3>but for people who,</v>

283
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 3>when they do the same thing as reincarnation,</v>

284
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 3>so it's like they turn it into this like thing where you are an animal or a</v>

285
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 3>person or whatever.</v>

286
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 3>There's so many,</v>

287
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 3>the thing we talked about once about reincarnation and that's only one,</v>

288
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 3>one version of it.</v>

289
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 3>There can be a million different versions of how the energy that your</v>

290
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is travels through the universe.</v>

291
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:06.591
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

292
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be through reincarnation or through through the normal sense.</v>

293
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you come from an alternate dimension before this one,</v>

294
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>someone completely different place.</v>

295
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:20.141
<v Speaker 3>Something where it's like octopuses floating around in some ether that can</v>

296
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 3>communicate telepathically.</v>

297
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what you came from.</v>

298
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have to be from Earth or this planet?</v>

299
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.393
<v Speaker 3>I just it,</v>

300
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

301
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you one of the weirdest things about,</v>

302
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

303
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 3>the biggest DMT experience that I ever had was when I,</v>

304
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 3>when I did it,</v>

305
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.861
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

306
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:33.694
<v Speaker 3>when it first,</v>

307
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 3>when it first popped over to the other side,</v>

308
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I said I've been here before.</v>

309
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 3>It was like a very clear feeling that I've been there before.</v>

310
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is like maybe there's like a little waiting room,</v>

311
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 3>a waiting room for the universe.</v>

312
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>That's like everything all connected and then every now and then you just get</v>

313
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>stuck into some sort of a situation,</v>

314
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 3>some confined existence or you're working your way through this world,</v>

315
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 3>trying</v>

316
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 4>to make sense of it,</v>

317
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

318
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 4>And then you'll end this one and pop out into the main lobby area and the</v>

319
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:02.731
<v Speaker 4>waiting room.</v>

320
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 4>And let's see what happens next time.</v>

321
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Something totally fucking completely alien and different beyond your</v>

322
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>

323
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.451
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

324
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 4>the confines of our imagination is based to what we've experienced.</v>

325
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

326
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:13.881
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

327
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:15.620
<v Speaker 4>our whole collective idea,</v>

328
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.401
<v Speaker 4>what the world is,</v>

329
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 4>is based on what we've experienced.</v>

330
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 4>Even photographs and things that we,</v>

331
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

332
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 4>haven't experienced but can see,</v>

333
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:22.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

334
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 4>like things that are in the galaxy and planets and shit.</v>

335
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean we used these and we have this,</v>

336
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 4>this whole map of our universe,</v>

337
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 4>but that's just what we see right now.</v>

338
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 4>There is just,</v>

339
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 4>it's only limited by our ability to think outside what we've already seen.</v>

340
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 4>The universe could be infinitely fucking bizarrely complicated to the point</v>

341
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.961
<v Speaker 4>where every different dimension has its own laws and rules and every different</v>

342
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 4>universe exists in the center of every single black hole like that.</v>

343
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 4>That might be all real shit.</v>

344
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 4>I could might be self fucking infinite and crazy and we maybe can't see it.</v>

345
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Well we shouldn't be able to see it cause it's so big.</v>

346
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 4>There's no way where these little tiny little bits of of neurology down here on</v>

347
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 4>this ball and we're supposed to be able to,</v>

348
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 4>there's no way we could,</v>

349
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 4>we could reckon with infinity,</v>

350
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 4>with the our limited minds.</v>

351
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that it's like a,</v>

352
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 4>it's a statement that if you you,</v>

353
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.221
<v Speaker 4>if you talk about it,</v>

354
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 4>people go,</v>

355
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.421
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah man,</v>

356
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 4>space ma'am,</v>

357
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but you want to talk about space,</v>

358
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 4>man wouldn't,</v>

359
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:24.280
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't we be thinking about the,</v>

360
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.931
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

361
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm piloting this fucking flesh vehicle around this,</v>

362
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

363
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

364
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 4>There's some sort of a dimension filled with other flesh vehicles.</v>

365
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't know what this was,</v>

366
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:35.214
<v Speaker 4>if I came from,</v>

367
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.701
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

368
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

369
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 4>no judgment whatsoever.</v>

370
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 4>It just a total neutral point and I looked at just human behavior moving around</v>

371
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.084
<v Speaker 4>on the planet.</v>

372
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 4>I want to be like,</v>

373
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 4>this is the most psychedelic shit ever,</v>

374
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 4>but just us.</v>

375
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 4>We were like the craziest character in a fucking movie.</v>

376
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 4>When we landed into La the other day,</v>

377
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 4>we flew in from Germany.</v>

378
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 4>We got in a metal tube.</v>

379
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 4>We flew from one side of the fucking planet where it was 10 hours ahead in time.</v>

380
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.750
<v Speaker 4>We flew all the way back to la,</v>

381
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 4>landed on the same day to these lights and shit and all these other metal tubes</v>

382
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 4>are flying in from everywhere.</v>

383
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

384
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 4>we are in the future or at this.</v>

385
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 4>This is some crazy fucking science fiction shit.</v>

386
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 4>It's going on right now.</v>

387
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 4>We don't even realize it.</v>

388
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 4>This whole world is psychedelic.</v>

389
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

390
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.361
<v Speaker 4>it really is,</v>

391
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:18.571
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

392
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:19.404
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

393
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>

394
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 4>The craziest things of when you've come across flowers or nature,</v>

395
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you look at it and you're like,</v>

396
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.071
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

397
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a fucking crazy.</v>

398
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>If I had this thing painted in my living room,</v>

399
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.220
<v Speaker 4>I would like have a panic attack and die.</v>

400
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

401
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 4>it's like the most amazing thing you could ever see ever.</v>

402
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Or it's also funny that everyone on this planet are,</v>

403
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 4>many people on this planet think they're living their own individual lives and</v>

404
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 4>they're completely free.</v>

405
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 4>But then when you go and look at the interstate and you look at the way people</v>

406
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

407
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 4>we'll move through the city.</v>

408
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:49.111
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

409
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 4>it's just this like bloodstream of like stop,</v>

410
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:52.284
<v Speaker 4>go right,</v>

411
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:52.711
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

412
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 4>stop,</v>

413
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>go right</v>

414
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.321
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

415
00:11:54.321 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 3>And they're all there.</v>

416
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Every single person,</v>

417
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 3>when you look at cars inside that car,</v>

418
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 3>they're going to see their girlfriend or going to their mom just died or they're</v>

419
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.630
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>

420
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

421
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 3>they're all having these amazingly complex experiences and they all think</v>

422
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>they're the most important fucking thing.</v>

423
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 3>And yet even in the midst of that,</v>

424
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 3>they're all operating exactly according to this bizarre technological pulsation.</v>

425
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.761
<v Speaker 3>Stop,</v>

426
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:16.500
<v Speaker 3>go left.</v>

427
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like flying at night.</v>

428
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like flying at night.</v>

429
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a circuit board and you looked like,</v>

430
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:20.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.980
<v Speaker 3>just the light's going through surgeries and stuff and it looks exactly like</v>

432
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 3>beyond the mind's eye to,</v>

433
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.141
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

434
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:26.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

435
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 3>the world is fractal.</v>

436
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.151
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

437
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 3>we talked about when you were talking about flowers and gorgeous flowers,</v>

438
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 3>flowers and like beautiful pine cones and shit.</v>

439
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 3>They all follow the FIBONACCI sequence.</v>

440
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

441
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a mathematical sequence that is like literally the order of the Earth,</v>

442
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.953
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

443
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the golden mean,</v>

444
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I believe is what they call that.</v>

445
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.011
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

446
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand math.</v>

447
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm a math retard.</v>

448
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 3>But this Fibonacci sequence they use to describe all these fractals,</v>

449
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 3>beautiful fractals in nature,</v>

450
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:52.370
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

451
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 3>like pine cones and like certain flowers and trees.</v>

452
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

453
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

454
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of the structure of,</v>

455
00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.181
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

456
00:12:58.181 --> 00:12:59.014
<v Speaker 3>of everything.</v>

457
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like literally like,</v>

458
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at what it is,</v>

459
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a code like,</v>

460
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:02.951
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

461
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 3>there's a code to this world.</v>

462
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 3>And then what's the code to that?</v>

463
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 3>What's the code to each individual part of,</v>

464
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

465
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

467
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 3>what's the code to the pine cone?</v>

468
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 3>What's the code to the tree?</v>

469
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 3>What's the code of the planet?</v>

470
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 3>It's eventually going to come down to we're going to have the code to</v>

471
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:16.181
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

472
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:16.721
<v Speaker 3>We're going to stand,</v>

473
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 3>understand everything and we're going to be able to recreate it.</v>

474
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

475
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I read this thing that Ray Kurzweil said,</v>

476
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.343
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

477
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 3>about how,</v>

478
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

479
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 3>it was really fucking intense.</v>

480
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 3>He said that,</v>

481
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

482
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 3>matter itself is like code.</v>

483
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.163
<v Speaker 3>Like in the computer,</v>

484
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 3>your computer right now is projecting a US or whatever and it's coming via some</v>

485
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 3>sort of code in the same way.</v>

486
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Like at the atomic level,</v>

487
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 3>everything's just a code.</v>

488
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 3>And once computers if accelerated to a certain rate,</v>

489
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 3>they will be able to send nanobots out that we'll deconstruct Adams and</v>

490
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:54.931
<v Speaker 3>reassemble reality in the same way computers deconstruct and reassemble pixels</v>

491
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:55.920
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

492
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 3>video and that sort of thing.</v>

493
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 3>So matter in reality itself will become,</v>

494
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 3>it's just like a,</v>

495
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the word for it is a um,</v>

496
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.691
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

497
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:08.140
<v Speaker 3>just a raw material that you can use to construct things.</v>

498
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is get like a hydrogen atom and a whatever Adam and another</v>

499
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:13.030
<v Speaker 3>item we just don't have,</v>

500
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 3>well we don't have nanobots and even if we did,</v>

501
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 3>we don't have an advanced enough computer that could run the swarm in that way</v>

502
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 3>to do that sort of thing.</v>

503
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think the next thing is going to be,</v>

504
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 3>or one of the next things is going to be,</v>

505
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be the ability to print things in your house that isn't paper to</v>

506
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 3>make things out of nothing.</v>

507
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to have machines at a certain point in time that are going</v>

508
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>to be able to actually create something like Ipod,</v>

509
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.671
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

510
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Like if you order an iPod and you turn your machine on and this is going to be</v>

511
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:40.541
<v Speaker 3>the shit like,</v>

512
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:40.721
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

513
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna make an iPod right now and it's going to be a huge novelty.</v>

514
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Just like the VHS tape was the VHS tape.</v>

515
00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:46.421
<v Speaker 3>Like Holy Shit,</v>

516
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:47.860
<v Speaker 3>we could record TV shows.</v>

517
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever thought you could stop it,</v>

518
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.190
<v Speaker 3>take a leak,</v>

519
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 3>come back and watch</v>

520
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

521
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You remember what a pimp you were when you first recorded your first TV show on</v>

522
00:14:56.671 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>a VCR with a clock.</v>

523
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>You use the clock and you came home and there was a tape waiting for you and</v>

524
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.421
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

525
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking genius wizard.</v>

526
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in the fucking future.</v>

527
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

528
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 1>That was a big deal.</v>

529
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:09.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

530
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember when my friend got an answering machine to create.</v>

531
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy deal,</v>

532
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

533
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.983
<v Speaker 1>What's going to be crazy?</v>

534
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>That's how they will,</v>

535
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll start selling things like they'll have bigger ones for bigger things</v>

536
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

537
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>oh I want a car and stuff,</v>

538
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>but then you're going to get the,</v>

539
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>the hackers have it.</v>

540
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.101
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

541
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:22.501
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

542
00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It went 10 Camaro's right now.</v>

543
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Tin Camaro's should imagine if we can just,</v>

544
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we have the just unhindered ability to just start printing shit and making fans.</v>

545
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the possibility.</v>

546
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be what time travel is somehow,</v>

547
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

548
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe get printed dimensional travel,</v>

550
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>do a changing of what Matt matter is.</v>

551
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 1>If he could just recreate matter.</v>

552
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to have something to recreate it with though,</v>

553
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:44.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

554
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have raw materials that you would put into a printer.</v>

555
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.501
<v Speaker 1>You would have to have,</v>

556
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're,</v>

557
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>if you're constructing reality,</v>

558
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you're just building,</v>

559
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.150
<v Speaker 1>that'd be dolphin or something.</v>

560
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like we have to use bunny rabbits.</v>

561
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Just wrap your head around that.</v>

562
00:15:57.021 --> 00:15:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

563
00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>You would have to have like a certain amount of minerals and a certain amount of</v>

564
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 1>like carbon and all these different things in your house and somehow or another</v>

565
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:10.031
<v Speaker 1>you would turn on this machine and we'll just bang print up this TV for you</v>

566
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>unless you could print the fuel for it.</v>

567
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

568
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 1>like if it's some kind of mineral,</v>

569
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.501
<v Speaker 1>it got so good.</v>

570
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You a real pimp.</v>

571
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>You would have like a room,</v>

572
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:18.051
<v Speaker 1>like a big room,</v>

573
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>like a garage where you just printed shit all the time.</v>

574
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

575
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>My print me up a Jaguar.</v>

576
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:23.144
<v Speaker 1>Check this shit out.</v>

577
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.871
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

578
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm printing up some ecstasy.</v>

579
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I met a cat.</v>

580
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I meant the actual cat.</v>

581
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean a car that was saying it while I was saying I was like,</v>

582
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.880
<v Speaker 1>what a poor choice of cat because it's a shitty car.</v>

583
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That could be a bad miss on a shitty caution.</v>

584
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad jaguar.</v>

585
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Jaguars actually looked pretty dope.</v>

586
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

587
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I like how you have grasshoppers in here.</v>

588
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

589
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep it like homeboy has been with me for a day.</v>

590
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

591
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:47.751
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

592
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little pet for you.</v>

593
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

594
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let them out eventually,</v>

595
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:51.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to freak them out.</v>

596
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to go home and get comfortable.</v>

597
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>He was all locked up for awhile.</v>

598
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Now it looks like he's moving.</v>

599
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you fed them?</v>

600
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You should feed them.</v>

601
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.231
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to feed him?</v>

602
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what day he leaves.</v>

603
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they have to eat the leaves of the,</v>

604
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to eat specific.</v>

605
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I think when bugs start eating leaves,</v>

607
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what they eat.</v>

608
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:05.691
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

609
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>If the one type,</v>

610
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what the,</v>

611
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.033
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

612
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be just making that shit up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she didn't,</v>

747
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone successfully got their Dick in her denial,</v>

748
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.070

<v Speaker 3>relationship with her.</v>

<v Speaker 3>more meaningful and it feels like he has a reason to go on and he feels like</v>

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.611
<v Speaker 3>lonely.</v>

911

<v Speaker 3>Like when you get that lonely,</v>

912
00:24:56.991 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 3>where you've gotten nuts and you can wake up in the morning and,</v>

913
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and really feel normal about having a relationship with an online porn star and</v>

914
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 3>no one wants to hang out with you and no one wants to talk to you and we saved</v>

915
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 3>up enough money and you're like,</v>

916
00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 3>today I'm going to buy a bottle of obsession.</v>

917
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.450
<v Speaker 3>When I think is crazy as the road of Warcraft couples where they just play</v>

918
00:25:16.451 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 3>together all day and all night and that's their whole life.</v>

919
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:18.981
<v Speaker 3>They've never met,</v>

920
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 3>ever hung out with each other,</v>

921
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:22.120
<v Speaker 3>but they're dating and they play video games,</v>

922
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.963
<v Speaker 3>get married,</v>

923
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 3>they get married inside the video games.</v>

924
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.413
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

925
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've discussed video games to death,</v>

926
00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:29.420
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>

927
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 3>that is a fascinating thing.</v>

928
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 3>This desire to exist in this,</v>

929
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 3>this two dimensional online world instead of the three d reality.</v>

930
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 3>And it's a weird pull,</v>

931
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

932

933
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

934

<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

935
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm guilty of being online all the time.</v>

936
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.641
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of times,</v>

937
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 3>even when I'm supposed to get work done,</v>

938
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a Douche bag that I'll just turn on my computer and then I'll check</v>

939
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Twitter real quick.</v>

1013
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 5>Does she get to be a warlock?</v>

1014
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 5>Cause she would get to be a dude.</v>

1015
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 5>Can anybody be whatever sex you want.</v>

1016
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where it is.</v>

1017
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:31.021
<v Speaker 5>And I think you want,</v>

1018
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 5>you can change the way it looks,</v>

1019
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if you can change the gender.</v>

1020
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 5>So she will be your character.</v>

1021
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 5>She'll take over your character.</v>

1022
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 5>You give her like the passwords.</v>

1023
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1024
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:39.041
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1026
00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:39.631
<v Speaker 5>and yeah,</v>

1027
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 5>you would give her all the password and all of a sudden she would be infinitely</v>

1028
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 5>powerful without having earned it.</v>

1029
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:45.750
<v Speaker 5>You probably have to do with the transfer of ownership,</v>

1030
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 5>like go to a game stop and both signed papers or if that's how you do it.</v>

1031
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.520
<v Speaker 5>I know you do like that.</v>

1032
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1033
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.180
<v Speaker 5>there has to be some kind of transfer of ownership because then that person</v>

1034
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 5>would just say,</v>

1035
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.910
<v Speaker 5>this is my character know.</v>

1036
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.671
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>

1037
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 5>Do they allow that shit?</v>

1038
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 5>They'll,</v>

1039
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 5>they allow people to do this.</v>

1040
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're supposed to do,</v>

1041
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.290
<v Speaker 5>but why didn't you get prepared before you got on this podcast?</v>

1042
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I'm kinda happy.</v>

1043
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember this.</v>

1044
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:08.491
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1045
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think they would prevent that?</v>

1046
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I've wondered that.</v>

1047
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:11.880
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fair.</v>

1048
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1049
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 5>it's just another fascinating aspect of it.</v>

1050
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 5>I guess maybe it could be because they would say that they should get the money</v>

1051
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 5>if somebody got the money.</v>

1052
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 5>But I feel,</v>

1053
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if a character invest all that time into the game and they can,</v>

1054
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 5>they can show something for it and they could sell that.</v>

1055
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 5>That's something that's just going to make the game more popular.</v>

1056
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.800
<v Speaker 5>I knew somebody who is a,</v>

1057
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.130
<v Speaker 5>what do you call it,</v>

1058
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember what they call them now,</v>

1059
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 5>that people in the police of the game that are kind of inside the game</v>

1060
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.670
<v Speaker 5>in the game,</v>

1061
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.780
<v Speaker 5>they have characters and they can,</v>

1062
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:40.540
<v Speaker 5>they go around,</v>

1063
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 5>they can appear and do shit.</v>

1064
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:42.791
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1066
00:28:42.791 --> 00:28:42.950
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1067
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 5>and they're indestructible but they're kind of like policing the player,</v>

1068
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 5>like moderators medicine,</v>

1069
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 5>a message board moderators this the same thing.</v>

1070
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.470
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

1071
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.333
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

1072
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 5>before I played world of Warcraft,</v>

1073
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:55.591
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1074
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.070
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1075
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.903
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's,</v>

1076
00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.873
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1077
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking neck geek.</v>

1078
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:00.931
<v Speaker 5>I'm a nerd.</v>

1079
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:01.081
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1080
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:02.630
<v Speaker 5>before I got addicted to world of Warcraft,</v>

1081
00:29:02.631 --> 00:29:04.620
<v Speaker 5>I got addicted to a everquest.</v>

1082
00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 5>I got busted.</v>

1083
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.650
<v Speaker 5>I got busted in that game by like a game cop,</v>

1084
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 5>like I cause like at the time it was still kind of like the wild west and they</v>

1085
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.100

<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1087
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1088
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it is in everquest now,</v>

1089
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 5>but then you could like try on other people's stuff.</v>

1090
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 5>They could give you stuff and you could try it on.</v>

1091
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:25.914
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.160
<v Speaker 3>People would start shooting it,</v>

1299
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.240
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1300
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:55.831
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1301
00:34:55.831 --> 00:34:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean just just back then it would've been like,</v>

1302
00:34:58.051 --> 00:34:59.790
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that</v>

1303
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.371
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1304
00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:04.650
<v Speaker 3>We don't even realize how quick this is all happening.</v>

1305
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:05.461
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1306
00:35:05.461 --> 00:35:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1307
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1308
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that nobody's really prepared for it.</v>

1309
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:10.560
<v Speaker 3>And the quicker it happens,</v>

1310
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.860
<v Speaker 3>the more I used to be like burning it,</v>

1311
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:14.790
<v Speaker 3>let it happen.</v>

1312
00:35:14.791 --> 00:35:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Let the fucking singularity pop.</v>

1313
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:17.641
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>

1314
00:35:17.641 --> 00:35:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's do the thing now it's kind of like shit.</v>

1315
00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:21.384
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1316
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm cool right here.</v>

1317
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Life is so easy.</v>

1318
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comic,</v>

1319
00:35:28.261 --> 00:35:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm having fun and we don't need to accelerate that much.</v>

1320
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Let's not get crazy everybody.</v>

1321
00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a good time.</v>

1322
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.813
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to,</v>

1323
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to Zap and is to have</v>

1324
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 4>to all be one.</v>

1325
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1326
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to emerge.</v>

1327
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.813
<v Speaker 4>Come on man.</v>

1328
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.691
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1329
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's just no way to stop it.</v>

1330
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:49.551
<v Speaker 4>And so I was flying back from Germany and I had this crazy epiphany about</v>

1331
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 4>civilizations cause I was,</v>

1332
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1333
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I was leaving Germany.</v>

1334
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:52.951
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1335
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:54.600
<v Speaker 4>it's so strange when you go to another culture,</v>

1336
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1337
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:55.870
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>

1338
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:56.321
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1339
00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 4>you don't have any idea what they're saying.</v>

1340
00:35:57.871 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1341
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.561
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1342
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 4>this is a different world is totally alien.</v>

1343
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 4>There's songs that they had on their,</v>

1344
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:02.701
<v Speaker 4>on their,</v>

1345
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:02.881
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1346
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 4>their TV shows.</v>

1347
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1348
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 4>we're all in German.</v>

1349
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 4>They have played a lot of American music though.</v>

1350
00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 4>I got a say like a good percentage of it.</v>

1351
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Like every now and then you'd hear something with a German voice or a German</v>

1352
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.003
<v Speaker 4>German dialogue,</v>

1353
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part the lyrics.</v>

1354
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 4>But for the most part it was all American shit.</v>

1355
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.921
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

1356
00:36:17.921 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 4>the people would talk to you,</v>

1357
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 4>they'd look at you and butch notes,</v>

1358
00:36:20.191 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 4>lactic and you're like,</v>

1359
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.133
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1360
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 4>like I don't have a fucking clue.</v>

1361
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:24.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1362
00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.323
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1363
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1364
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 4>And they would look at you like,</v>

1365
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:28.171
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

1366
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:28.621
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

1367
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

1368
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Like at the airport when they were telling you to go over here,</v>

1369
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.910
<v Speaker 4>what they're saying,</v>

1370
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:33.211
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1371
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

1372
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1373
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Nick mystic,</v>

1374
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:35.963
<v Speaker 4>no clean.</v>

1375
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.530
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

1376
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.240
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1377
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:37.610
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

1378
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:38.443
<v Speaker 4>where it's,</v>

1379
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking strange thing man.</v>

1380
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 4>And I'm,</v>

1381
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about how bizarre it is that there's so many different languages</v>

1382
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 4>and I'm thinking about how weird it is that some of these cultures had been</v>

1383
00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:47.604
<v Speaker 4>around forever.</v>

1384
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.211
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1385
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1386
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 4>and then I start thinking like,</v>

1387
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happens to all these different cultures that have existed before?</v>

1388
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 4>It pretty much is the same thing.</v>

1389
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 4>They figure out how to create shelters.</v>

1390
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Then they go from having shelters to creating a surplus to having a group of</v>

1391
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:03.451
<v Speaker 4>shelters.</v>

1392
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 4>They all protect themselves from the animals and then once enough to worry about</v>

1393
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>getting eaten,</v>

1394
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 4>then they start figuring things out.</v>

1395
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.510
<v Speaker 4>Then they started inventing things and coming up with things,</v>

1396
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 4>getting curious to the point where they make a very complicated society that</v>

1397
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:15.414
<v Speaker 4>hums along.</v>

1398
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 4>They have a May immense structures and all these cool things and then all the</v>

1399
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:24.000
<v Speaker 4>people that did all this crazy hard work have kids and the kids are born into</v>

1400
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 4>this perfect world where they don't have to try to,</v>

1401
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.610
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1402
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 4>to discover anything.</v>

1403
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to create things because the things are already existing.</v>

1404
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to develop a civilization and a scratch and figure out how to be</v>

1405
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 4>strong in the woods because there's all these resources.</v>

1406
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.910
<v Speaker 4>They figured out how to write things down so they don't have to relearn shit.</v>

1407
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.841
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1408
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.171
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1409
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 4>it's just people get soft.</v>

1410
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Like that's probably the reason that every single civilization eventually fell</v>

1411
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.593
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>

1412
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.433
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1413
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.371
<v Speaker 4>he talked about like,</v>

1414
00:37:47.371 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1415
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.331
<v Speaker 4>throughout history,</v>

1416
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 4>whenever they would talk about like the fall of the Roman empire.</v>

1417
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Tha Tha tha tha the whole theme to it was always the decadence and the depravity</v>

1419
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.750
<v Speaker 4>and the crazy sexual shit that they were doing and how life had just gotten in</v>

1420
00:38:01.751 --> 00:38:02.521
<v Speaker 4>sand for them.</v>

1421
00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:03.930
<v Speaker 4>They were all like living in,</v>

1422
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 4>in eating insane amounts of food and fucking little boys and having people fight</v>

1423
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 4>animals and shit.</v>

1424
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:09.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1425
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1426
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 4>and it's got to have come from a place where those people were weak.</v>

1427
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Those people didn't have to put it all together.</v>

1428
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:17.761
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1429
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1430
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.391
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1431
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:18.661
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1432
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 5>I think specifically with the Roman Empire,</v>

1433
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure people out there will correct me on this belt warrant,</v>

1434
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.180
<v Speaker 5>wasn't Rome sacked by the Visigoths who are these like brutal barbarians.</v>

1435
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:31.250
<v Speaker 5>You just came in and just raped and killed everybody and Natalie.</v>

1436
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:31.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1437
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:35.220
<v Speaker 5>And that brought in the dark ages and I'm the dark ages.</v>

1438
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.800
<v Speaker 5>What was bringing a civilization back out of the dark ages was um,</v>

1439
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.471
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1440
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:42.221
<v Speaker 5>Christianity,</v>

1441
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:42.761
<v Speaker 5>religion,</v>

1442
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 5>religion was like creating at least a little bit of order to a kind of like</v>

1443
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 5>bring people out of the dark.</v>

1444
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:53.670
<v Speaker 5>But all of a sudden the vikings figured out that all they had to do is go to</v>

1445
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 5>like a monastery or a church and they could just grab all the gold and shit and</v>

1446
00:38:59.171 --> 00:38:59.711
<v Speaker 5>go off.</v>

1447
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:00.221
<v Speaker 5>They basically,</v>

1448
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 5>the vikings discovered Europe and they started,</v>

1449
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 5>they came in and pushed it back into the dark ages again cause they were sacking</v>

1450
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1451
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.140
<v Speaker 5>And like vikings are the most brutal fucking,</v>

1452
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.790
<v Speaker 5>they were the most brutal humans ever because like that,</v>

1453
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 5>one of the stories they told us there was a viking who had this funny nickname</v>

1454
00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:19.750
<v Speaker 5>and I can't remember nickname,</v>

1455
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:22.720
<v Speaker 5>but the other vikings laughed at him.</v>

1456
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 5>They thought he was funny because he wouldn't kill kids.</v>

1457
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 5>They thought it was funny and they had a nickname for him.</v>

1458
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 5>Like you pussy,</v>

1459
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 5>you are he killing these kids?</v>

1460
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking fun.</v>

1461
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 5>And they would just go in and kids and there were these crazy Rudel fucking</v>

1462
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 5>warriors.</v>

1463
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.521
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1464
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:40.354
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

1465
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with this kind of,</v>

1466
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:41.801
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1467
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 5>at that time it was starving people,</v>

1468
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 5>but before that it's these lazy fat,</v>

1469
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1470
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 5>people who've never really fought before,</v>

1471
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 5>at least like fought in that brutal level.</v>

1472
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:51.574
<v Speaker 5>And they just got,</v>

1473
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 5>they just kind of hit at the wrong time.</v>

1474
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1475
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:53.940
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1476
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Had gotten hit back when Rome was strong and before everything fell apart,</v>

1477
00:39:57.671 --> 00:39:59.860
<v Speaker 5>they probably would've been able to hold those guns off the idea.</v>

1478
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:00.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1479
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:00.461
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

1480
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:00.611
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1481
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1482
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.420
<v Speaker 5>I think that is the idea that,</v>

1483
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.011
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1484
00:40:03.011 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about the history other than the what's connected to it in</v>

1485
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:07.211
<v Speaker 5>popular myth.</v>

1486
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 5>So always gluttony and orgies of food and you know,</v>

1487
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 5>the talk of feathers in the throat vomitorium so they would throw up so they</v>

1488
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:14.680
<v Speaker 5>could eat more.</v>

1489
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1490
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:15.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1491
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the,</v>

1492
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

1493
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 5>that usually is what happens is people,</v>

1494
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean really that isn't that a symptom of people confusing what's important</v>

1495
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 5>with the material universe.</v>

1496
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Cause people start trying to gratify their centers.</v>

1497
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.250
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1498
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 5>and really that's just a distraction from what's really important.</v>

1499
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:32.890
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

1500
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.730
<v Speaker 5>so when that gets to the extreme where everyone is just focused on buying shit</v>

1501
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:37.950
<v Speaker 5>or floats,</v>

1502
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a faulty system that we have.</v>

1503
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 5>And once the environment gets super complicated,</v>

1504
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 5>it's eventually everyone's gonna want to take time off.</v>

1505
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:50.650
<v Speaker 5>They're going to want to not have to hunt and gather and they're going to want</v>

1506
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 5>things easier and lighter and they had to want more for their kids.</v>

1507
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't want my kids who struggle like me.</v>

1508
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.460
<v Speaker 5>And so then we want a softer,</v>

1509
00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.980
<v Speaker 5>easier world development.</v>

1510
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:03.990
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that is w Schumann's ideas and our,</v>

1511
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:04.501
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

1512
00:41:04.501 --> 00:41:07.900
<v Speaker 5>our best inventions have come through hard work and adversity.</v>

1513
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 5>People who like people who have worked very,</v>

1514
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 5>very hard to think things through and figure things out and invent new things.</v>

1515
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1516
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 5>when everything's already there and you don't have to do that,</v>

1517
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 5>like what happens then?</v>

1518
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:22.540
<v Speaker 5>And then you have kids and they see you and then we'll look at this lazy fat</v>

1519
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

1520
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Why should I do anything hard or try to be anything special or try to contribute</v>

1521
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Speaker 5>or try to figure things out or even try to be happy.</v>

1522
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 5>Nobody else has happened.</v>

1523
00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck makes me think that I should be happy?</v>

1524
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:32.861
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1525
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:33.190
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1526
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.910
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1527
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1528
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1529
00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.080
<v Speaker 5>I really think that it's a result of people losing track of,</v>

1530
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1531
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.230
<v Speaker 5>the greater truth in the universe.</v>

1532
00:41:45.231 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 5>And so I think the moment you start tuning into that,</v>

1533
00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 5>that's when you start getting the ideas that lead to the inventions and lead to</v>

1534
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:51.831
<v Speaker 5>the hard work.</v>

1535
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:53.390
<v Speaker 5>Because fucking hard work.</v>

1536
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1537
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1538
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 5>everyone says if you want to write a book,</v>

1539
00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.270
<v Speaker 5>you gotta write six hours a day.</v>

1540
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Speaker 5>You have to treat it like a job.</v>

1541
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 5>You have to fucking write all the fucking time.</v>

1542
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 5>And that's true.</v>

1543
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1544
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 5>to really do that,</v>

1545
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 5>you've got to be passionate.</v>

1546
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 5>You've got to want to do it.</v>

1547
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 5>You have to be inspired.</v>

1548
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 5>The inspiration drives you to work that hard.</v>

1549
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.761
<v Speaker 5>And so right now,</v>

1550
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 5>no one's inspired.</v>

1551
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Most people have no inspiration cause they're not connecting to the thing that</v>

1552
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 5>brings those big ideas into your head.</v>

1553
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.570
<v Speaker 5>When maybe that maybe when there isn't the Internet and technology and all that</v>

1554
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:24.080
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

1555
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.930
<v Speaker 5>it's more likely that those ideas come to you or something like that.</v>

1556
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.960
<v Speaker 5>I think it's also possibly a situation where the hardware has evolved so quickly</v>

1557
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.240
<v Speaker 5>that our life has changed so radically that are our physical bodies just are not</v>

1558
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:41.210
<v Speaker 5>in tuned to the reward systems that we're getting from this society.</v>

1559
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.580
<v Speaker 5>That's why we're trying to supplement them with antidepressants and shed.</v>

1560
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 5>Our bodies are designed for some hunting and gathering and fucking,</v>

1561
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 5>that's what our bodies are designed for and if you don't exert a certain amount</v>

1562
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:52.160
<v Speaker 5>of energy,</v>

1563
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 5>that's why people get stressed.</v>

1564
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:58.190
<v Speaker 5>You know that people who exercise are way more stress free than people who never</v>

1565
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 5>exercise because your body just accumulates all this crazy shit that you're</v>

1566
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be getting out of your system.</v>

1567
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.170
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to be chasing down elk and shit.</v>

1568
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to be moving bails of Hay and if you're not doing all that stuff</v>

1569
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:08.961
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

1570
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.420
<v Speaker 5>why do you even have Mussel beds?</v>

1571
00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 5>You just sit around the house and jerk off.</v>

1572
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.011
<v Speaker 5>Why do you even have,</v>

1573
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Speaker 5>you should have enough muscle to get to the refrigerator and back to the couch.</v>

1574
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 5>There also,</v>

1575
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 5>you don't need any other muscle.</v>

1576
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.810
<v Speaker 5>It also seems like there's a lot more calculations and math going on too,</v>

1577
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 5>because if you think about even 15 years ago,</v>

1578
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.080
<v Speaker 5>you're not thinking about Twitter numbers.</v>

1579
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 5>You're not thinking about Facebook numbers are thinking about online stuff and</v>

1580
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 5>bills and and news and you have so much information pump that your brain is</v>

1581
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 5>constantly thinking way more than it was.</v>

1582
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 5>Then back in the day was like,</v>

1583
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.521
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1584
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:35.540
<v Speaker 5>it's windy outside.</v>

1585
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.500
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

1586
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1587
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 5>this eliminate.</v>

1588
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

1589
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.700
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if someone who could buy us beer,</v>

1590
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1591
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.870
<v Speaker 5>but you know that we are different.</v>

1592
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're talking about?</v>

1593
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:44.331
<v Speaker 5>The numbers.</v>

1594
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:45.830
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about red band,</v>

1595
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 5>these are all illusions.</v>

1596
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.300
<v Speaker 5>People are spending all their time calculating these filaments.</v>

1597
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.960
<v Speaker 5>Thrill idea,</v>

1598
00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.170
<v Speaker 5>my bank account number,</v>

1599
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:59.171
<v Speaker 5>how much I owe or how much data you says those Zeros are aware what the fuck</v>

1600
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 5>type they're imaginary or the Senate or the Congress or the president or the</v>

1601
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:03.350
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

1602
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.880
<v Speaker 5>all imaginary things that aren't,</v>

1603
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.570
<v Speaker 5>they're just these a theory things out there when it's like if you go into your</v>

1604
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 5>backyard and dig and plant seeds and grow something that's real,</v>

1605
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 5>you can look out there and see how many seeds or plants you have growing up and</v>

1606
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:16.401
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1607
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking real.</v>

1608
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 5>What is the economy?</v>

1609
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.940
<v Speaker 5>Just imaginary quantitative easing and we're going to buy stock shares and stock</v>

1610
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 5>trades and send them over to brush men,</v>

1611
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 5>Boston,</v>

1612
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:25.971
<v Speaker 5>Ben Bernanke,</v>

1613
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 5>he said he's going to double the quantity.</v>

1614
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.011
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1615
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1616
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Land was completely free though,</v>

1617
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 5>would be more of the case.</v>

1618
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:32.731
<v Speaker 5>Now you,</v>

1619
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 5>if you don't,</v>

1620
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.010
<v Speaker 5>if you know pay bills and live at someplace you,</v>

1621
00:44:36.011 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 5>you get kicked off land and there's no free land.</v>

1622
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 5>That's how it all started.</v>

1623
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 5>Is the native Indians being like,</v>

1624
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.040
<v Speaker 5>you want it?</v>

1625
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 5>You want to buy this land with the fuck he talking?</v>

1626
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1627
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.861
<v Speaker 5>seven bucks.</v>

1628
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 5>You could have Manhattan,</v>

1629
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.451
<v Speaker 5>Indiana,</v>

1630
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 5>than any other mother fucker like you dumb mother fucker will get to the idea to</v>

1631
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:53.881
<v Speaker 5>them was absolutely,</v>

1632
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:54.691
<v Speaker 5>completely ridiculous.</v>

1633
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 5>And now the whole thing is criss crossed.</v>

1634
00:44:57.151 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 5>All of society is crisscrossed with tiny,</v>

1635
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 5>weird connections.</v>

1636
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 5>The deed to the house and the land and the house and the certificate of</v>

1637
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:07.530
<v Speaker 5>ownership of the House and the property tax you pay and all this,</v>

1638
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:09.270
<v Speaker 5>it's all imaginary shit.</v>

1639
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 5>None of it's real.</v>

1640
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 5>We all believe it's real.</v>

1641
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.640
<v Speaker 5>Now only do believe we believe her.</v>

1642
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.041
<v Speaker 5>It's real.</v>

1643
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 5>But we're so focused on it that we've forgotten about what Israel,</v>

1644
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.260
<v Speaker 5>which is the material universe,</v>

1645
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 5>which is the fucking,</v>

1646
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1647
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 5>water and the ground and the environment.</v>

1648
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 5>And we're just pumping shit out into it because that stuff doesn't seem real.</v>

1649
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a leisure thing.</v>

1650
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 5>You go out for a hike in the woods on a Sunday,</v>

1651
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 5>that's when you go into nature.</v>

1652
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:35.550
<v Speaker 5>You maybe on occasion take the lady for a picnic,</v>

1653
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1654
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 5>but that's how you go to nature.</v>

1655
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 5>And now,</v>

1656
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1657
00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:39.211
<v Speaker 5>and it's just a,</v>

1658
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:40.560
<v Speaker 5>it's like a novelty.</v>

1659
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 5>Well look a tree,</v>

1660
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.150
<v Speaker 5>that tree dude,</v>

1661
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.660
<v Speaker 4>nobody realized how more than me when I actually moved to the woods when I was</v>

1662
00:45:49.661 --> 00:45:51.280
<v Speaker 4>living in Colorado for those months,</v>

1663
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.160
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

1664
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:52.993
<v Speaker 4>almost four months.</v>

1665
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:54.160
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1666
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.880
<v Speaker 4>when I was living,</v>

1667
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.370
<v Speaker 4>I was basically living on a dirt road on the mountain,</v>

1668
00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.540
<v Speaker 4>like in the middle of nowhere,</v>

1669
00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.310
<v Speaker 4>like literally completely in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1670
00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:03.580
<v Speaker 4>And you see everything that you see all this shit that's alive.</v>

1671
00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's just running around out there and man it out here.</v>

1672
00:46:06.011 --> 00:46:07.900
<v Speaker 4>I see a deer every now and then out here.</v>

1673
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1674
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:08.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1675
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you see like,</v>

1676
00:46:09.551 --> 00:46:10.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1677
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:10.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1678
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.210
<v Speaker 4>coyotes all the time and every now and then someone will see a mountain lion in</v>

1679
00:46:13.211 --> 00:46:13.990
<v Speaker 4>this area here,</v>

1680
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.180
<v Speaker 4>but in Colorado was all over the place.</v>

1681
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.420
<v Speaker 4>It was like you were in there,</v>

1682
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.520
<v Speaker 4>their area,</v>

1683
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.690
<v Speaker 4>like they walked through town,</v>

1684
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.080
<v Speaker 4>there was this place called evergreen and every year the elk would migrate</v>

1685
00:46:23.081 --> 00:46:26.950
<v Speaker 4>through town and you're talking about hundreds of these giant animals.</v>

1686
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.330
<v Speaker 4>They're like deer on steroids.</v>

1687
00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:31.810
<v Speaker 4>He's big fucking Brock Lesnar looking deer and they walk into the middle of</v>

1688
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:32.500
<v Speaker 4>town,</v>

1689
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.460
<v Speaker 4>they don't give a fuck.</v>

1690
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:35.350
<v Speaker 4>They walk right on the the streets.</v>

1691
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.281
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of them.</v>

1692
00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:36.551
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1693
00:46:36.551 --> 00:46:37.181
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

1694
00:46:37.181 --> 00:46:38.680
<v Speaker 4>Like this giant migration of them.</v>

1695
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.000
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1696
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 4>And you know what goes with them.</v>

1697
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Lions.</v>

1698
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.393

1701
00:46:46.241 --> 00:46:49.720
<v Speaker 4>you've got to worry about mountain lions being around to the fact that oh yeah,</v>

1702
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.670
<v Speaker 4>noise that used to be life.</v>

1703
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:55.030
<v Speaker 4>One Dude shot one in his backyard while I was living there.</v>

1706
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.710

1707
00:47:02.711 --> 00:47:07.150
<v Speaker 4>monster eating your chickens in a cage and it quad its way into this cage and</v>

1708
00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:09.580
<v Speaker 4>it's in there now and you've got to shoot it before it eats you.</v>

1709
00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.180
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1710

<v Speaker 4>Cause it could eat you.</v>

1711
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:11.801

1712
00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:11.981
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1713
00:47:11.981 --> 00:47:13.510
<v Speaker 4>this is way better than a chicken.</v>

1714
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.400
<v Speaker 4>Let me just eat this old person.</v>

00:47:16.841 --> 00:47:18.400
<v Speaker 4>If you don't get good with that finger,</v>

1719
00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:19.031
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>

1720
00:47:19.031 --> 00:47:20.500
<v Speaker 4>you got to get good with that finger.</v>

1721
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.000
<v Speaker 4>You better have an aim bitch.</v>

1722
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1723
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 5>like our version of that is I got a parking ticket.</v>

1724
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.150
<v Speaker 5>It's the same,</v>

1725
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 5>it's like</v>

1726
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 4>a negative force impacting your life,</v>

1727
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:37.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's a much more humbling and beautiful forest that makes you appreciate</v>

1728
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 4>your real place in the circle.</v>

1729
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:39.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1730
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 4>when I was living up there,</v>

1731
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 4>what I really loved about it is that I would go to New York and shit and I was</v>

1732
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1733
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 4>when I first started moving there,</v>

1734
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.823
<v Speaker 4>when I first moved there,</v>

1735
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 4>I did the open Anthony Show and uh,</v>

1736
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I stayed in this hotel in New York that had this crazy view and I looked out the</v>

1737
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:54.791
<v Speaker 4>window and I'm just like,</v>

1738
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 4>how weird is this that I'm like right now I'm on the death star and I live with</v>

1739
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 4>fucking grizzly Adams up in the woods.</v>

1740
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm living right now.</v>

1741
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a,</v>

1742
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:02.763
<v Speaker 4>this is my,</v>

1743
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 4>my new place.</v>

1744
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.150
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going from like the wilderness to cities and we'll invest to La a couple</v>

1745
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 4>of times to wilderness to different places where I did stand up and I was like,</v>

1746
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the fucking strangest ways to look at things ever.</v>

1747
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Because now I'm getting at you.</v>

1748
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.241
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1749
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at the whole world from the outside.</v>

1750
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 4>I live on dirt,</v>

1751
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 4>I live on dirt with trees.</v>

1752
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 4>That's all that's around you.</v>

1753
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 4>And when you like that and you're in this like really tight little small</v>

1754
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 4>community up there because very,</v>

1755
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 4>very few people,</v>

1756
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.330
<v Speaker 4>you get a totally different view of the whole world.</v>

1757
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 4>It's all going on in Saudi Arabia,</v>

1758
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.091
<v Speaker 4>you know in Iraq.</v>

1759
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 4>There's issues right now with bombs and shit's blowing up and they're starting</v>

1760
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1761
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:38.741
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

1762
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:39.371
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>

1763
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:39.441
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1764
00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:39.571
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1765
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:39.721
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1766
00:48:39.721 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 4>the Mecca there.</v>

1767
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:43.560
<v Speaker 4>They're all making their pilgrimage to Mecca and all this is all gone.</v>

1768
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 4>The news and I'll just look out and I'll still a little chipmunks and shit.</v>

1769
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.970
<v Speaker 4>Shit much were just chilling.</v>

1770
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 4>Chipmunks don't give a fuck about Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>

1771
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 4>It's doing near here.</v>

1772
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.451
<v Speaker 4>Don't like,</v>

1773
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 4>what are you tripping on dude?</v>

1774
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.483
<v Speaker 4>Just relax.</v>

1775
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Chipmunks.</v>

1776
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 4>People are trying to eat us and we're cool.</v>

1777
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1778
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:58.230
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1779
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 4>we'll see.</v>

1780
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.291
<v Speaker 4>And so that,</v>

1781
00:48:59.291 --> 00:48:59.920
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

1782
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 4>that's an experience with something called health.</v>

1783
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

1784
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.760
<v Speaker 4>that's what it feels like to be healthy if feels like it's,</v>

1785
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 4>it feels like to be,</v>

1786
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.070
<v Speaker 4>we are so connected.</v>

1787
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:11.020
<v Speaker 4>I think with our physical hardware,</v>

1788
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 4>our bodies that are set up for the caveman days,</v>

1789
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.780
<v Speaker 4>we're so connected with what our bodies need that if we're like completely</v>

1790
00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:20.710
<v Speaker 4>plugged into the system,</v>

1791
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I think our whole shit is getting rewired like in this weird like super quick</v>

1792
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:30.700
<v Speaker 4>way because we have to keep up with all the bullshit you have to be aware of in</v>

1793
00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 4>life and you don't have this peaceful time that people used to have.</v>

1794
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Like even when people were hunters and gatherers and shit,</v>

1795
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.200
<v Speaker 4>when when they will fucking made houses and they figured out how to make fire</v>

1796
00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:42.870
<v Speaker 4>places and shit at the end of the night after they killed an animal and the</v>

1797
00:49:42.871 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 4>sitting around eating it,</v>

1798
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.190
<v Speaker 4>they were fucking relaxed.</v>

1799
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.623
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1800
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.080
<v Speaker 4>And let them owe anybody shit unless they're stressing about things that we</v>

1801
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:50.914
<v Speaker 4>didn't stress about.</v>

1802
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:52.361
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1803
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 4>there's a blizzard and our house and it's way better to be alive now.</v>

1804
00:49:55.061 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there's definitely right about that guy.</v>

1805
00:49:57.791 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 4>There's an anarchist that you can look up and his name is John Zerzan and he's,</v>

1806
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:03.070
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating guy.</v>

1807
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:04.240
<v Speaker 4>He's very intelligent.</v>

1808
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.820
<v Speaker 4>And he talks about his premises.</v>

1809
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

1810
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1811
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1812
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 4>that was times were terrible.</v>

1813
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:12.610
<v Speaker 4>But before that and the distant past,</v>

1814
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 4>before people started using language or assemble systems to represent reality,</v>

1815
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 4>we were in paradise.</v>

1816
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that man.</v>

1817
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:21.890
<v Speaker 4>That's so speculative.</v>

1818
00:50:21.891 --> 00:50:22.190
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1819
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 4>and what the problem I have with that is if we were in paradise,</v>

1820
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.350
<v Speaker 4>why did it all turned to shit?</v>

1821
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I think have this romantic way of looking at the past.</v>

1822
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:29.991
<v Speaker 4>And I guarantee you,</v>

1823
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 4>if you fucking go to the zoo and see how do she,</v>

1824
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 4>chimps are to each other,</v>

1825
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:33.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1826
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 4>watch documentaries about chimps sneaking across lines and beating the fuck out</v>

1827
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 4>of other chimps and killing them.</v>

1828
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 4>And then coming back to their little,</v>

1829
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.011
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1830
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1831
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm not buying it.</v>

1832
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 4>We evolved because of competition.</v>

1833
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 4>That's for the most part,</v>

1834
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 4>the only reason why things get better.</v>

1835
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 4>They get better because I have to,</v>

1836
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 4>because everything else is getting better around them.</v>

1837
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 4>So if we were in paradise,</v>

1838
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.620
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are we come up with language and fucking,</v>

1839
00:50:52.621 --> 00:50:53.271
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

1840
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:54.104
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with Zeros.</v>

1841
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:55.310
<v Speaker 4>And I was just knocked out.</v>

1842
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Their brains get infinitely more complex as things go along.</v>

1843
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to happen.</v>

1844
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

1845
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 4>the ethic of the universe.</v>

1846
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean that at one point in time when it wasn't as complex,</v>

1847
00:51:05.361 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 4>it was better that golden age that's there.</v>

1848
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.803
<v Speaker 4>They're crazy.</v>

1849
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 4>They're all kinda talks about that a little bit though.</v>

1850
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:11.201
<v Speaker 4>He's his,</v>

1851
00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 4>his psychedelically induced though,</v>

1852
00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 4>which is much more plausible theory.</v>

1853
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:14.923
<v Speaker 4>The idea,</v>

1854
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 4>his idea is that Mckenna thought that at one point in time the monkeys had gone</v>

1855
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.211
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1856
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 4>the climate had changed and the rain forest had receded to grasslands.</v>

1857
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.200
<v Speaker 4>So the monkeys were climbing out of the trees and experimenting with different</v>

1858
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:27.891
<v Speaker 4>food sources.</v>

1859
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 4>And one of them was they would flip over cow patties to find bugs down date and</v>

1860
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1861
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.541
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1862
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 4>and they ate mushrooms and they developed and,</v>

1863
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:34.841
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1864
00:51:34.841 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1865
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 4>but that one is based on like an actual plant that exists.</v>

1866
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:39.583
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1867
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.480
<v Speaker 4>And so like an actual time where the,</v>

1868
00:51:41.481 --> 00:51:41.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1869
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1870
00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:42.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1871
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 4>rain forest did receive,</v>

1872
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 4>this is all fact,</v>

1873
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:45.344
<v Speaker 4>that's all science.</v>

1874
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 4>And they know that much monkeys have eaten mushrooms.</v>

1875
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1876
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:52.520
<v Speaker 4>they know a bunch of different instances of all sorts of animals eating all</v>

1877
00:51:52.521 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 4>sorts of things that affect their consciousness.</v>

1878
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Like elephants will get used to like fermented fruit and they get drunk off of</v>

1879
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:57.630
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1880
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 4>It happens with monkeys if they get,</v>

1881
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.070
<v Speaker 4>they get used to booze.</v>

1882
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Somebody posted on my Facebook,</v>

1883
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.830
<v Speaker 4>a great video of Orangutans,</v>

1884
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:07.820
<v Speaker 4>David Attenborough,</v>

1885
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 4>shelling orangutans,</v>

1886
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 4>washing socks in a river.</v>

1887
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 4>One of them is trying to saw a piece of wood.</v>

1888
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 4>One of them's got a hammer and it's hitting a nail,</v>

1889
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:20.180
<v Speaker 4>kind of looks like in dawn of the dead when the zombies tried to do shit.</v>

1890
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:20.511
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1891
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:21.860
<v Speaker 4>like they're kind of doing it wrong,</v>

1892
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:23.480
<v Speaker 4>but they're definitely like Zombie.</v>

1893
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.620
<v Speaker 4>They're imitating,</v>

1894
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:24.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1895
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:25.591
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1896
00:52:25.591 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 4>it's like look it up,</v>

1897
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 4>David Attenborough orangutan.</v>

1898
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's there,</v>

1899
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you look at that and you see how quickly the orangutans are</v>

1900
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 4>adopting these sort of behavior patterns from what they're watching and you can</v>

1901
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 4>see how quickly it would all fucking happen.</v>

1902
00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:40.330
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1903
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:41.031
<v Speaker 4>it's just a trick.</v>

1904
00:52:41.031 --> 00:52:43.280
<v Speaker 4>And they're all trained monkeys and that is,</v>

1905
00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.911
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

1906
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:44.151
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1907
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:45.350
<v Speaker 4>now you're going to be hammering here,</v>

1908
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1909
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1910
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Actually that's what the first thing he said is,</v>

1911
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 4>these are not trained monkeys.</v>

1912
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:49.470
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

1913
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 4>they're just imitating.</v>

1914
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:52.783
<v Speaker 4>How do you know Brian?</v>

1915
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.181
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1916
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's a liar.</v>

1917
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.611
<v Speaker 4>He's not a liar.</v>

1918
00:52:56.611 --> 00:52:58.580
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing is fascinating,</v>

1919
00:52:58.581 --> 00:52:58.920
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1920
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea of evolution happening right before our eyes is fascinating.</v>

1921
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1922
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:04.850
<v Speaker 4>There was a lizard that was fucking,</v>

1923
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 4>forget the exact story,</v>

1924
00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:08.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's very clear evolution and the change of its,</v>

1925
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 4>its stomach because it was on an island for 20 years.</v>

1926
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean they came from one environment,</v>

1927
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:14.870
<v Speaker 4>they had to adapt to a new one,</v>

1928
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 4>but they adapted like super quick and they're still there alive with like a very</v>

1929
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.260
<v Speaker 4>clear difference between the lizards.</v>

1930
00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 4>So to come from,</v>

1931
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:20.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1932
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 4>the original origin or original source,</v>

1933
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1934
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 4>The Congo is another perfect of that.</v>

1935
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:25.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1936
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 4>the Congo,</v>

1937
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 4>like 2000 years ago,</v>

1938
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 4>the Congo was grasslands and it be,</v>

1939
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 4>the climate shifted very quickly in all these like prairie or plains animals.</v>

1940
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.551
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1941
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm like gazelles and a even rhinos,</v>

1942
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.970
<v Speaker 4>they're stuck in this rain forest.</v>

1943
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 4>It just kind of grew up around them.</v>

1944
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Weird Dude,</v>

1945
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:45.204
<v Speaker 4>the Congo,</v>

1946
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about this before on the documentary and I don't know how to get</v>

1947
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:48.600
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1948
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 4>The documentary is from the BBC.</v>

1949
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1950
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 4>and it's not available on DVD.</v>

1951
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I tried to find it.</v>

1952
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.850
<v Speaker 4>I can't fucking find it.</v>

1953
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.380
<v Speaker 4>Might be,</v>

1954
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.061
<v Speaker 4>isn't that illegal?</v>

1955
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:57.820
<v Speaker 4>We would never do that.</v>

1956
00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

1957
00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 4>You do that?</v>

1958
00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 4>I own it.</v>

1959
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 4>I own it on VHS.</v>

1960
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 4>But VHS is just so God damn clunky.</v>

1964
00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.143
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1965
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Like isn't there an English version or is that just DVDs?</v>

1966
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.423
<v Speaker 4>No TV.</v>

00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 4>another pond and he jumps in the water and then he gets eaten by this crazy bird</v>

<v Speaker 4>We will never become us,</v>

2011
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:28.440

2012
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 4>have never figured out how to kill all those lizards.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Mckenna fucked my dog.</v>

2018
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.880
<v Speaker 5>Reptilian reptilian transformation.</v>

2019
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the reptilian transformation videos on the Internet?</v>

2020
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.980
<v Speaker 5>They were so funny.</v>

2021
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.390
<v Speaker 5>Proof that,</v>

2022
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.110
<v Speaker 5>what's his name?</v>

2023
00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:49.520
<v Speaker 5>Who's that crazy guy does interviews,</v>

2024
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:54.200
<v Speaker 5>lyric dike proof that Larry King is a rep telling you and it always has this</v>

2025
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:56.390
<v Speaker 5>dramatic music playing kind of techno music.</v>

2026
00:55:56.391 --> 00:55:57.224
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>

2027
00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.240
<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>

2028
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.840
<v Speaker 5>And it slowed down on Larry King and for whatever dumb reason,</v>

2029
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Larry King licks his lips like,</v>

2030
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 5>and it kind of looks like a lizard,</v>

2031
00:56:07.401 --> 00:56:09.950
<v Speaker 5>but right when he licks his lips and music changes and it's like,</v>

2032
00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:10.421
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2033

<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2036
00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2037
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:15.860
<v Speaker 5>like this is a proof that fucking Larry King is a lizard.</v>

2038
00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Sure isn't a joke.</v>

2039
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2040
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.640
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2041
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 5>people believe in the reptilians table.</v>

2042
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't that sound like a tiller or</v>

2043
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just the ongoing troll on the Internet that you're falling for?</v>

2044
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.941
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2045
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:28.661
<v Speaker 1>It'd be Brian.</v>

2046
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:29.201
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>

2047
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of trolls.</v>

2048
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 1>There are so many Goddamn trolls.</v>

2049
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:34.810
<v Speaker 1>So many people that think it's funny to pretend to be somebody who they're not.</v>

2050
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2051
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit about that.</v>

2052
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.070
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the,</v>

2053
00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2054
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.673
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2055
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2056
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.330
<v Speaker 1>these are serious.</v>

2057
00:56:40.331 --> 00:56:40.661
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2058
00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I told you the time I talked to Eddie Griffin.</v>

2059
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 1>He explained the whole reptilian brain at all,</v>

2060
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 1>even my credit card number.</v>

2061
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think he's just making it up as human beings on the planet?</v>

2062
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.850
<v Speaker 1>How long would the dinosaurs on the planet look how much we evolve and the time</v>

2063
00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 1>we were here?</v>

2064
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.040
<v Speaker 1>How much more did the dinosaurs evolved?</v>

2065
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He would hit you with some shit like this.</v>

2066
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Who'd like to take a drink of his like little champagne bottle?</v>

2067
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:02.920
<v Speaker 1>He's doubled his little Paul Mooney champagne bottles.</v>

2068
00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I think about this dog.</v>

2069
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 1>If people came from monkeys and monkeys is still here.</v>

2070
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck a monkey's doing?</v>

2071
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Why are they still here?</v>

2072
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 1>How come there's still monkeys?</v>

2073
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 1>If we came from monkeys,</v>

2074
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Shit's impossible.</v>

2075
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:18.641
<v Speaker 1>He's like a black show.</v>

2076
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 1>He did is he's,</v>

2077
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.530
<v Speaker 1>he's his own thing.</v>

2078
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He talks about you follow into the fall.</v>

2079
00:57:23.631 --> 00:57:24.464
<v Speaker 1>Joey's stories.</v>

2080
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.890
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>

2081
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense too.</v>

2082
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.033
<v Speaker 1>He's funny though.</v>

2083
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>When I saw him in the days we've talked about Eddie Griffin on the podcast too</v>

2084
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:31.001
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

2085
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:31.834
<v Speaker 1>Sorry folks.</v>

2086
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:32.420
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>

2087
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you got to get to let shit go where it goes.</v>

2088
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:34.751
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2089
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2090
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>when I first met Eddie Griffin,</v>

2091
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 1>that was in when he first just did his HBO special dude.</v>

2092
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucking good that each real special.</v>

2093
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it holds up.</v>

2094
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.983
<v Speaker 1>I said this before,</v>

2095
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it since I saw it back then,</v>

2096
00:57:47.321 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw it back then it was like,</v>

2097
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 1>this is one dynamic fucking entertainer.</v>

2098
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Like this dude is little and skinny and he was moving around quick and I was</v>

2099
00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:53.981
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2100
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:54.341
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2101
00:57:54.341 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>He was just a fucking star.</v>

2102
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like an undeniable star.</v>

2103
00:57:58.271 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It was like boom.</v>

2104
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 1>But I've never met a dude so crazy.</v>

2105
00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.373
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2106
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So much fun.</v>

2107
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2108
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:06.160
<v Speaker 1>he is so crazy.</v>

2109
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 1>But he's really cool.</v>

2110
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.030
<v Speaker 1>He had a cigarette in his hand and we're the backstage of the comedy store.</v>

2111
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I did 12 rounds today with a kickboxing champion.</v>

2112
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2113
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>For the first six rounds I've met it.</v>

2114
00:58:17.371 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 1>He got the best domain.</v>

2115
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Speaker 1>But NIGGA didn't want no mon the last six.</v>

2116
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.374
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2117
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want no mo and he's drinking and he's got a cigarette and I'm like,</v>

2118
00:58:27.551 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>here's a movie star.</v>

2119
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's making up a story about fighting a kickboxing champion.</v>

2120
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:33.503
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2121
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I just think he would just get drunk and just see if he could fuck with you.</v>

2122
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I just think he was like creating stories in his mind.</v>

2123
00:58:39.311 --> 00:58:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think he was really lying to you.</v>

2124
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just for him.</v>

2125
00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a have a good time.</v>

2126
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to talk some crazy shit.</v>

2127
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.300
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2128
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.133
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2129
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't,</v>

2130
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2131
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2132
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2133
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't committed to the theory either.</v>

2134
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:51.423
<v Speaker 1>You could change him.</v>

2135
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He could change his opinion.</v>

2136
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:53.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2137
00:58:53.231 --> 00:58:53.910
<v Speaker 1>like we had,</v>

2138
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 1>we had a conversation once about the pyramids.</v>

2139
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:56.471
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2140
00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>the pyramids were created with sound.</v>

2141
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what you don't know.</v>

2142
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.870
<v Speaker 1>The pyramids were creaky.</v>

2143
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You did with sound.</v>

2144
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 1>They use harmonic resonance and Magneto,</v>

2145
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 1>he's making some shit up and they moved those stones into place.</v>

2146
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2147
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how they moved those stones in the place,</v>

2148
00:59:13.161 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 1>but they think they might've been cement that was poured to the deal with the</v>

2149
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 1>stones is the incredible numbers.</v>

2150
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 1>2,300,000 so I just start fucking hitting him with all these facts.</v>

2151
00:59:20.831 --> 00:59:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's of kind of being douchey about it yet,</v>

2152
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's just one of my pet subjects.</v>

2153
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And I hate when people talk nonsense about the parents.</v>

2154
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:26.451
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2155
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 1>So I go into mining,</v>

2156
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>even been poured limestone,</v>

2157
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:29.810
<v Speaker 1>it might not even been cut,</v>

2158
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 1>but there is.</v>

2159
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So I tell him all this shit.</v>

2160
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2161
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

2162
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:33.523
<v Speaker 1>how many stones?</v>

2163
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So he goes on stage 10 minutes later,</v>

2164
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the pyramids you telling me 2,300,000 stones are cut perfectly.</v>

2165
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:44.430
<v Speaker 1>He was just absorb.</v>

2166
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like,</v>

2167
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:45.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2168
00:59:45.951 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 1>he just would,</v>

2169
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 1>who changed his opinion?</v>

2170
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:47.991
<v Speaker 1>Like you could,</v>

2171
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you could tell him that he was wrong and we go,</v>

2172
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.851
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2173
00:59:49.851 --> 00:59:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about that now.</v>

2174
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's got this very evangelical quality to him.</v>

2175
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about anything.</v>

2176
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 1>He could happen 10 minutes before and he would go onstage and he would just fire</v>

2177
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 1>off about it.</v>

2178
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2179
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the fun things about the comedy store.</v>

2180
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2181
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it don't get me wrong what I'm saying.</v>

2182
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean like when I'm telling that he does this mean he does and it's all most of</v>

2183
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:10.814
<v Speaker 1>his own shit.</v>

2184
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2185
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that he's taking anybody's ideas or anything.</v>

2186
01:00:13.521 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that he's just a fascinating character.</v>

2187
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:17.144
<v Speaker 1>He would like,</v>

2188
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2189
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>he'd move in and out,</v>

2190
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.113
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2191
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He would like be brilliant and then be crazy,</v>

2192
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.391
<v Speaker 1>but when he was brilliant,</v>

2193
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:23.631
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2194
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:23.991
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2195
01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>where's this?</v>

2196
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing,</v>

2197
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2198
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>He would hit some notes,</v>

2199
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2200
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:28.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2201
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>crazy dude.</v>

2202
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I seen that guy destroyed in a way where I'm like,</v>

2203
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:34.011
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2204
01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like really special.</v>

2205
01:00:35.211 --> 01:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>He's got a special talent.</v>

2206
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2207
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>He had some killer jokes,</v>

2208
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>but my favorite one is the one about about cocaine and cocaine being involved</v>

2209
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>with the invention of the telephone that go.</v>

2210
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2211
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:46.461
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2212
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:50.480
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to be high like a mother fucker to be sitting around going,</v>

2213
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to someone who's not even here.</v>

2214
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fucking joke.</v>

2215
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I saw him light that fucking comedy store original room up with that joke.</v>

2216
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You've got gotta be high like a mother fucker with a cigarette in his hand to be</v>

2217
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>sitting around going,</v>

2218
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to somebody who I am.</v>

2219
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And he would just hit them with this perfect facial expression.</v>

2220
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:16.971
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2221
01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2222
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>it was humbling.</v>

2223
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2224
01:01:18.461 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like my early days of news radio in 1994 you know,</v>

2225
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>and I was like my act as like weak kind of work on my act.</v>

2226
01:01:24.231 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I got to tighten it up and they see a guy like that,</v>

2227
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:26.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2228
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you'd see a few guys that you'd see perform.</v>

2229
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So Damon Wayans crack some out of the park.</v>

2230
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Damon Wayans is one of the most underrated guys ever do when Damon Wayans did</v>

2231
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>his HBO special.</v>

2232
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.020
<v Speaker 1>That is a funny fucking special.</v>

2233
01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>That still holds up.</v>

2234
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's still pretty fun.</v>

2235
01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.750
<v Speaker 1>His stuff is always good to ship.</v>

2237
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Talking about meet Tommy Hearns and about meeting Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson was</v>

2238
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>mad at him cause he was making jokes about them.</v>

2239
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:51.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2240
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>it's funny fucking shit man.</v>

2241
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.193
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

2242
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck it up.</v>

2243
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:56.294
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go it.</v>

2244
01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's like some lab designed him a punch of Mickey liver be you think you're</v>

2245
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>funny?</v>

2246
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>

2247
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>he started biting me.</v>

2248
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.361
<v Speaker 1>That was what he said.</v>

2249
01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>He biting him and I think it was before the event or Holyfield in Sudan.</v>

2250
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've made this special before Tyson bit Holyfield's ear.</v>

2251
01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure which is even crazier if he did,</v>

2252
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but it was a funny fucking special mat.</v>

2253
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>This had a bunch of good shit in it.</v>

2254
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I watched it the other day was unlike these are your online,</v>

2255
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if I saw it online,</v>

2256
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>if I saw it on the TV,</v>

2257
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2258
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>he's underrated man.</v>

2259
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He was one of those guys that for whatever reason got famous for movies and got</v>

2260
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>famous for a lot of stuff.</v>

2261
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>But when he was on like as a standup,</v>

2262
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>he was fucking great man.</v>

2263
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>He was great.</v>

2264
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Like he was really good.</v>

2265
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just shocking to me how few people recognize that.</v>

2266
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2267
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>

2268
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:41.604
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever,</v>

2269
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've seen him do stand reeling dude.</v>

2270
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch his,</v>

2271
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called last stand.</v>

2272
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it's called.</v>

2273
01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2274
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:49.351
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2275
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it the other day for the first time in years and it was really good,</v>

2276
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:53.161
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2277
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:53.491
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2278

<v Speaker 1>this stuff is,</v>

2279
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 1>he's a sole likable and his whole relaxed on stage and just he's had just a real</v>

2280
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 1>comic man,</v>

2281
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.261
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2282
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't really get the credit that he deserves for that.</v>

2283
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2284
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2285
01:03:04.261 --> 01:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2286
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2287
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2288
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2289
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>contradict myself because I always say that people get exactly the credit that</v>

2290
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>they deserve because,</v>

2291
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:11.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2292
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.933
<v Speaker 1>no one should,</v>

2293
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.601
<v Speaker 1>people who like,</v>

2294
01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2295
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.860
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get enough credit,</v>

2296
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:14.071
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2297
01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:14.521
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2298
01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:14.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2299
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:15.391
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking,</v>

2300
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:15.871
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

2301
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>he's not connecting to people,</v>

2302
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2303
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:17.881
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

2304
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>he's not putting it out or he's not getting it broadcast.</v>

2305
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got to figure it out.</v>

2306
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:21.481
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2307
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>he can't just be good.</v>

2308
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2309
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody has to know you're good.</v>

2310
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:24.901
<v Speaker 1>You have to let everybody know.</v>

2311
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:25.770
<v Speaker 1>There's something out there that again,</v>

2312
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:26.191
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like this guy here.</v>

2314
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 1>You could see what he does on Youtube and it's gotta be something out there to</v>

2315
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>connect to people if you're not doing it,</v>

2316
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:31.764
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2317
01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you see ll cool j last night on Conan O'brien?</v>

2318
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Something's weird with that guy,</v>

2319
01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 1>you know one got it.</v>

2320
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Find a clip or watch their habits.</v>

2321
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Well he was just acting very crazy and then like not anything insane,</v>

2322
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>but like you were just kind of watching him really.</v>

2323
01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Something's not right.</v>

2324
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe he went too far in some kind of drug or something.</v>

2325
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.331
<v Speaker 1>But he was talking about,</v>

2326
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>he was at this play recently in La,</v>

2327
01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>like a month ago.</v>

2328
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I did not hear about this.</v>

2329
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And in the play there's this part where like this wall falls down or something</v>

2330
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2331
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2332
01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:04.383
<v Speaker 1>It's wobbling.</v>

2333
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And he saw this wall starting to fall down and he runs on stage grabs this woman</v>

2334
01:04:10.831 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 1>tries to get her to protect her from this wall.</v>

2335
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And the woman's like,</v>

2336
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you're ruining my,</v>

2337
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.033
<v Speaker 1>my show,</v>

2338
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2339
01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:17.880
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a play.</v>

2340
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And he got kicked out and everything like that.</v>

2341
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>But he's telling the story and I'm like,</v>

2342
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 1>this can't be true.</v>

2343
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I googled it and then sure enough there was like newspaper articles about ll</v>

2344
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:26.151
<v Speaker 1>cool j.</v>

2345
01:04:26.151 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It goes crazy and jumps on stage of play.</v>

2346
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>We must have been so high unless it was so high.</v>

2347
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:32.851
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2348
01:04:32.851 --> 01:04:33.501
<v Speaker 1>this fucking wall.</v>

2349
01:04:33.501 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill the kids.</v>

2350
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.323
<v Speaker 1>He's going to die.</v>

2351
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking ll cool J.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm to jump up there and shit.</v>

2353
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And he just seemed very positive on the Coney.</v>

2355
01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

2356
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I just love everything I do.</v>

2357
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2358
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>he like he,</v>

2359
01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he was anti depressants.</v>

2360
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seemed like.</v>

2362
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I got to see it now.</v>

2363
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Pull that shit up on,</v>

2364
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.961

2369
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2370
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2371
01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>You're a web genius.</v>

2372
01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's available online?</v>

2373
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>If it's that weird,</v>

2374
01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:01.651
<v Speaker 1>see him.</v>

2375
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody probably did it right?</v>

2376
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:03.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2377
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:03.991
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

2378
01:05:03.991 --> 01:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2379
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was just me.</v>

2380
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2381
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.463
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it though.</v>

2382
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:07.861
<v Speaker 1>You think it was?</v>

2383
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was just you that thought it was help.</v>

2384
01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

2385
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

2386
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>How high were you when this was happening?</v>

2387
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:11.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2388
01:05:11.921 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2389
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I was not sure.</v>

2390
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:13.921
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>

2391
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:14.671
<v Speaker 1>I was not high.</v>

2392
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It just like he was being weird and then,</v>

2393
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>then he told that story and then it was like,</v>

2394
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:19.301
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2395
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>there's something really weird is going on.</v>

2396
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>We pay full attention or will you semi masturbating while you're watching this?</v>

2397
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I was laying in,</v>

2398
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.863
<v Speaker 1>laying in bed.</v>

2399
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>If you leave a man by himself alone in a room with a TV on,</v>

2400
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>80% of his time will be spent semi masturbating.</v>

2401
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2402
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

2403
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2404
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to run mumbles.</v>

2405
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It feels good and no one's here.</v>

2406
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>So will you tell the truth bro?</v>

2407
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I was just laying in bed actually,</v>

2408
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be weird as fuck on.</v>

2409
01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>He got nervous watching an ll cool j,</v>

2410
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2411
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>past videos.</v>

2412
01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>You just created this fucking dilemma laying in bed with your tramp dog.</v>

2413
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.100
<v Speaker 1>So was it actually an effect that he didn't recognize it?</v>

2414
01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Was that what was going on or did he actually write?</v>

2415
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It was an effect that he thought was really happening.</v>

2416
01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Like a wall was falling down and he grabbed in the actress,</v>

2417
01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>oh boy.</v>

2418
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just wanting to try to fuck her real quick.</v>

2419
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>He apologized and he said,</v>

2420
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:10.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2422
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>so he's like,</v>

2423
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm really embarrassed about the whole situation,</v>

01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2455
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the bad things about living in la.</v>

2456
01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.713
<v Speaker 1>No gay place,</v>

2457
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you will inevitably get invited to one of your actor friends death.</v>

2458
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And it is deck I went to,</v>

2459
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I went to one with my brother and it was so bad and it was just very serious,</v>

2460
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>very serious part.</v>

2461
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 1>That's super serious part.</v>

2462
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And my brother is tr,</v>

2463
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're with someone and they're trying not to laugh and you look</v>

2464
01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>over and you see and then you're trying not to laugh at the same time.</v>

2465
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.100
<v Speaker 1>So in the middle of this play,</v>

2466
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:27.550
<v Speaker 1>which is about the witch burnings and this woman's doing this very dramatic</v>

2467
01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:29.890
<v Speaker 1>monologue about the witch burnings.</v>

2468
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I look over and my brother's like,</v>

2469
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:31.811
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2470
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 1>his fist balled up and it looks like he's crying.</v>

2471
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he was being a fag.</v>

2472
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Worse ma'am.</v>

2473
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was trying not to laugh so hard.</v>

2474
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:44.531
<v Speaker 1>He was actually,</v>

2475
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:45.311
<v Speaker 1>we both work.</v>

2476
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.121
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you laughed,</v>

2477
01:07:46.121 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it would be that it's a tiny little black box and you would just look like the</v>

2478
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>biggest asshole Brian Callen took me to,</v>

2479
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:56.910
<v Speaker 1>he had this acting teacher and this acting teacher was a fan of musicals.</v>

2480
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And though he claimed to be married to a woman,</v>

2481
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I had questions.</v>

2482
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2483
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.220
<v Speaker 1>that's neither here nor there.</v>

2484
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So we go to this,</v>

2485
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>this show that this guy puts on and Brian says,</v>

2486
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop by my acting coach real quick.</v>

2487
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 1>He's got this thing going on.</v>

2488
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:10.421
<v Speaker 1>Come with me.</v>

2490
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 1>It'll be fun.</v>

2491
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:11.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>He likes musicals.</v>

2500
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:16.740
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of,</v>

2501
01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.181
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be cool.</v>

2508
01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:23.211
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2509

<v Speaker 4>we're fucking ballistically smashed.</v>

2513
01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.004
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2514
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.110

2515
01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 4>where I just wouldn't go deep to way too many times I would go like in public</v>

2516
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.070
<v Speaker 4>are just way too high.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2518
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:44.930
<v Speaker 4>We should be a home at home under the covers with the lights out.</v>

2519
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.351
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2520
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I should be in my jammies and here I am just wondering around with seeing random</v>

2521
01:08:50.061 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2522
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 4>So this guy goes on stage and he's wearing those slip on shoes.</v>

2523
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I hate like when I see men with those slip on dress shoes with the hardwood and</v>

2524
01:08:58.851 --> 01:08:59.500
<v Speaker 4>he'll,</v>

2525
01:08:59.500 --> 01:08:59.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2526
01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 4>those little s wouldn't,</v>

2527
01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:01.420
<v Speaker 4>you know those are things.</v>

2528
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2529
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 4>they're almost as bad as the frog shoes.</v>

2530
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:03.861
<v Speaker 4>The sandals.</v>

2531
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:04.694
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're talking about.</v>

2532
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.500
<v Speaker 4>A penny loafers pending offers yet.</v>

2533
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 4>And then wearing them with little skinny black socks like that is not</v>

2534
01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:10.214
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>

2535
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 4>That's an uncomfortable shit.</v>

2536
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

2537
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have to wear that stupid thing for business?</v>

2538
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you doing now?</v>

2539
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 4>You're out singing anywhere and he's stupid fucking shoes.</v>

2540
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:18.600
<v Speaker 4>And this is just me though.</v>

2541
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 4>That's weird thing about people dressing like,</v>

2542
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2543
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:21.521
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>

2544
01:09:21.521 --> 01:09:21.681
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2545
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:21.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2546
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:22.191
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2547
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:22.650
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

2548
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to like appear to be something to me.</v>

2549
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.241
<v Speaker 4>So he's singing,</v>

2550
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:27.860
<v Speaker 4>he gets on stage and he starts saying,</v>

2551
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 4>and this is what he sings,</v>

2552
01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:30.980
<v Speaker 4>songs that are in musicals.</v>

2553
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:33.403
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>

2554
01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.440
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

2555
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.020
<v Speaker 4>one of them walk,</v>

2556
01:09:36.021 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

2557
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:41.620
<v Speaker 4>One of the lyrics was he was like singing a song like to a little girl,</v>

2558
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:43.130
<v Speaker 4>like as dumb.</v>

2559
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:44.810
<v Speaker 4>It might've been a daughter or something like that.</v>

2560
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.943
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

2561
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.890
<v Speaker 4>breathe when you need to breathe.</v>

2562
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Like that was one of the lines.</v>

2563
01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 4>What was Brian Cowen doing?</v>

2564
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.060
<v Speaker 4>We were biting our hands by their hands and my toes were curling under</v>

2565
01:09:58.671 --> 01:09:59.510

<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2805
01:16:58.781 --> 01:16:59.614
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2806
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems like there's a bunch of different empires did the exact same</v>

2807

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2809
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Like the Greeks,</v>

2810
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.601
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2811
01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:06.160
<v Speaker 1>They had fantastic structures.</v>

2812
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:07.060
<v Speaker 1>They never repaired them.</v>

2813
01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Everything went to shit.</v>

2814
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And then civilization of stayed in the same</v>

2815
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 4>area but became completely vastly different.</v>

2816
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2817

2819
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 4>They got these incredible structures,</v>

2820
01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:18.130
<v Speaker 4>like some of the most amazing things that people have ever built ever.</v>

2822
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:19.184
<v Speaker 4>The Acropolis,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sculptures and shit.</v>

2826
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 4>And then they just kind of stopped doing that and let it all fall to shit.</v>

2827
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 4>Like they forgot how to repair those buildings.</v>

2835
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:47.270
<v Speaker 4>They just kind of let it fall apart and nobody owns it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they built the coliseum and then just fucked off.</v>

2852
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2853
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2854
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.810
<v Speaker 4>I can remember right when this is it we're in right now.</v>

2855
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.500
<v Speaker 4>He started to kind of go into this collapsed and it was like three,</v>

2856
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how many years ago it was,</v>

2857
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 4>but I remember like sitting in a movie theater and looking down and there's this</v>

2858
01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:18.650
<v Speaker 4>rip in the seat and I looked over and there to rip and then another seat and I</v>

2859
01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:18.861
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

2860
01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2861
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:20.361
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>

2862
01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Like that would normally be repaired.</v>

2863
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:21.991
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2864
01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:24.680
<v Speaker 4>it was like things are kind of fraying at the edges a little bit.</v>

2865
01:18:24.681 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 4>A while ago and now what you're talking about is happening here much more like</v>

2866
01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:29.601
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2867
01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 4>if you look around when you're,</v>

2868
01:18:30.681 --> 01:18:31.131
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

2869
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 4>when you're out looking at dirty,</v>

2870
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.621
<v Speaker 4>the cars are,</v>

2871
01:18:33.621 --> 01:18:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I know that sounds stupid,</v>

2872
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:36.800
<v Speaker 4>but people aren't washing their cars.</v>

2873
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Like cars are really cost money to wash your car.</v>

2874
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 4>People have a lot of money now and things are really getting dilapidated.</v>

2875
01:18:43.401 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 4>You can kind of see this kind of added this.</v>

2876
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Paul is sending over things that I've never seen in my whole life.</v>

2877
01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen that shit before.</v>

2878
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:51.140
<v Speaker 4>We've never been a part of a recession before.</v>

2879
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:51.371
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2880
01:18:51.371 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2881
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 4>we never been a part of when the fake system falls apart and then they have to</v>

2882
01:18:54.681 --> 01:18:55.514
<v Speaker 4>kind of rebuild,</v>

2883
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:59.420
<v Speaker 4>but they don't really rebuild the rebuild on the same structure of what I call</v>

2884
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 4>unfixable bullshit.</v>

2885
01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:01.281
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2886
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 4>the stock market,</v>

2887
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:02.781
<v Speaker 4>the economy,</v>

2888
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 4>the political system that we have.</v>

2889
01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:04.420
<v Speaker 4>It's all like,</v>

2890
01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.120
<v Speaker 4>you're going to rebuild the society on this fucking house of lies.</v>

2891
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:08.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2892
01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.130
<v Speaker 4>we've got to figure out a new way to do things.</v>

2893
01:19:10.131 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm looking at these other civilizations,</v>

2894
01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 4>like the Greeks and the Romans,</v>

2895
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.200
<v Speaker 4>the ones that risen and fell like look at the Egyptian.</v>

2896
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:16.791
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

2897
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:17.091
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2898
01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:19.640
<v Speaker 4>when they discovered those ruins,</v>

2899
01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:20.451
<v Speaker 4>those ruins the parent.</v>

2900
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no one living in them.</v>

2901
01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:22.221
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

2902
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 4>they're just giant monuments that had been taking open and they'd been,</v>

2903
01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2904
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:29.570
<v Speaker 4>people would read them and stolen all the artifacts and stuff and sold them,</v>

2905
01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:30.410
<v Speaker 4>but there was,</v>

2906
01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:31.790
<v Speaker 4>there's no one living in there.</v>

2907
01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Those are the most amazing structures human beings have ever created.</v>

2908
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:37.910
<v Speaker 4>And their civilization devolved to the point where people moved out.</v>

2909
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:38.910
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

2910
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty incredible,</v>

2911
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.480
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty incredible.</v>

2912
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Most amazing civilization ever.</v>

2913
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 4>And it fell apart so much.</v>

2914
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 4>So there was no one living there.</v>

2915
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2916
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.420
<v Speaker 4>What the Mayans too right now,</v>

2917
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the is to doing very,</v>

2918
01:19:50.961 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 4>very interesting and similar story.</v>

2919
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.250
<v Speaker 4>They don't know exactly what happened with the Mayans.</v>

2920
01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:55.971
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2921
01:19:55.971 --> 01:19:56.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2922
01:19:56.361 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 4>the Mayans weren't like,</v>

2923
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 4>like someone said,</v>

2924
01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.341
<v Speaker 4>oh they were,</v>

2925
01:19:58.341 --> 01:19:58.971
<v Speaker 4>they were killed.</v>

2926
01:19:58.971 --> 01:19:59.301
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

2927
01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

2928
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:00.913
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

2929
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what happened to the mines.</v>

2930
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 4>It appears like the man's just left.</v>

2931
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:07.070
<v Speaker 4>That's why all these nutty fucking lizard reptilian believe in.</v>

2932
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:08.690
<v Speaker 4>So they were in a space ship.</v>

2933
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.880
<v Speaker 4>They came and [inaudible] took them on a fiery serpent serpent with feathers,</v>

2934
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:15.121
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2935
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:15.954

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:16.973
<v Speaker 4>A chordal.</v>

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:20.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:22.220
<v Speaker 4>There was a movie called model.</v>

2943
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:25.800
<v Speaker 4>There was a movie called cue and I liked when I was a kid,</v>

2944
01:20:25.801 --> 01:20:27.720

2964
01:20:49.651 --> 01:20:50.484
<v Speaker 4>the guy who wrote,</v>

2965
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:52.201
<v Speaker 4>he wrote,</v>

2966

<v Speaker 4>He made a scene and,</v>

2970
01:20:57.831 --> 01:20:59.280
<v Speaker 4>and then someone actually sent me the scene.</v>

2971
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:01.080
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was inventing a beautiful moment.</v>

2972
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.670
<v Speaker 4>A guy,</v>

2978
01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:13.741
<v Speaker 4>writer,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2987
01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.340
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty the coolest scripture,</v>

2988
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:26.340
<v Speaker 4>the way you described it to,</v>

3013
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:54.211
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3014

3020
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:08.610
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason and all of a sudden he's,</v>

3021
01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 4>he just stops and he's like,</v>

3022

<v Speaker 4>I've got a blade in my pocket and I will cut you.</v>

3025
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Shrunk.</v>

3026

<v Speaker 4>It was totally serious.</v>

01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:23.880
<v Speaker 4>Like he was,</v>

3028
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:28.710
<v Speaker 4>he was like ready to fight cause he was a bar brawl brawl with people and he did</v>

3029
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:29.461
<v Speaker 4>it on purpose.</v>

3030
01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Like his whole idea was that it got to live.</v>

3031
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.190
<v Speaker 4>You got fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Can't just fucking shit this out.</v>

3036
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.880
<v Speaker 4>And this really crazy way of looking at life that you had,</v>

3037
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 4>he was willing to like believe a wild life or his writing.</v>

3038
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Well he reminds me of like a zen master.</v>

3039
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:55.521
<v Speaker 4>Like if you read zen poetry and like this pure crisp description of reality</v>

3040
01:22:55.831 --> 01:22:56.620
<v Speaker 4>that's theirs.</v>

3041
01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 4>It's the same kind of thing,</v>

3042
01:22:57.571 --> 01:23:02.571
<v Speaker 4>but he's just talking about filthy whore tenements and people were like,</v>

3043
01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 4>well that's not good.</v>

3044
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3045
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.681
<v Speaker 4>yes it is.</v>

3046
01:23:04.681 --> 01:23:06.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just not good for him.</v>

3047
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:07.383
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3048
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I ate a pot cookie on the plane so it was not the best time to be watching</v>

3049
01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:11.310
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

3050
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Just guys on negative,</v>

3051
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 1>God damn so crazy,</v>

3052
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:14.471
<v Speaker 1>but he's negative.</v>

3053
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Ever get scared of that though,</v>

3054
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to eat the wrong strongest cookie ever.</v>

3055
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.960
<v Speaker 1>One time it happened many times I've learned some of the greatest lessons about</v>

3056
01:23:21.961 --> 01:23:22.280
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3057
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.340
<v Speaker 1>little prizes,</v>

3058
01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 1>like I get scared by those trips,</v>

3059
01:23:25.121 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but those trips teach me everything.</v>

3060
01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.793
<v Speaker 1>That's where I learn.</v>

3061
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.241
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3062
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't listen.</v>

3063
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't normally invite that onto yourself,</v>

3064
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.910
<v Speaker 1>etc. Or whatever reason.</v>

3065
01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You eat too much and then you're like going into the fucking grader.</v>

3066
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:42.220
<v Speaker 1>There's layers upon layers of denial and a good pot cookie will wipe out nearly</v>

3067
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 1>all them bitches nearly all and fucking shine some lights on,</v>

3068
01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:47.890
<v Speaker 1>some shit you forgot about.</v>

3069
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's healing too.</v>

3070
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:50.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3071
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:50.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3072
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone talks about how marijuana has medicinal and I never understood that</v>

3073
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:57.720
<v Speaker 1>until I ate a lot of pot and was a,</v>

3074
01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 1>was like laying down and I really felt as though,</v>

3075
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 1>or like going through my psyche and doing a defrag or something,</v>

3076
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:05.591
<v Speaker 1>I was like put,</v>

3077
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:05.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3078
01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3079
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:07.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3080
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it was like cleaning up stuff and like getting rid of the bullshit and it really</v>

3081
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>like for weeks after that I felt a million times happier.</v>

3082
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3083
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it really is like medicine for the ego.</v>

3084
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3085
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like ego tablets.</v>

3086
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Ego's been lying to you here,</v>

3087
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 1>take this and you could see what's going on.</v>

3088
01:24:22.571 --> 01:24:23.404
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

3089
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you've got all this happening here.</v>

3090
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I know this is why you won't do that.</v>

3091
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:26.771
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3092
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't clean your office because you don't want to come to the consequences</v>

3093
01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:29.630
<v Speaker 1>of being a success.</v>

3094
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3095
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.903
<v Speaker 1>if</v>

3096
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you let go what your fucking parents did,</v>

3097
01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:34.511
<v Speaker 1>they were stupid.</v>

3098
01:24:34.511 --> 01:24:35.111
<v Speaker 1>They were young too.</v>

3099
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:35.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3100
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

3101
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.410
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an grudge.</v>

3102
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:41.740
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a coach standing right next to you tie that in a tank.</v>

3103
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:43.571
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's at.</v>

3104
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:43.871
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3105
01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:46.930
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's how we can have a way better world if people would just,</v>

3106
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I need to make a duck and it's not a documentary thing.</v>

3107
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I need to make something happen where more people get access to these tanks and</v>

3108
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 1>like document it,</v>

3109
01:24:56.890 --> 01:24:58.930
<v Speaker 1>set these tanks up all over the place,</v>

3110
01:24:59.140 --> 01:24:59.501
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

3111
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:03.490
<v Speaker 1>get people involved in them and get them to get high as fuck and go in there and</v>

3112
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:05.230
<v Speaker 1>get them to reevaluate their life.</v>

3113
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You should do it as AI.</v>

3114
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.600
<v Speaker 1>It would be awesome is if you can figure out a way to do that with prisons.</v>

3115
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:15.130
<v Speaker 1>C three you get prisoners make the water dirty.</v>

3116
01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:15.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3117
01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta,</v>

3118
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3119
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:17.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3120
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 1>that's too much work.</v>

3121
01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:19.421
<v Speaker 1>It's work,</v>

3122
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:19.871
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

3123
01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:20.710
<v Speaker 1>to me that's the,</v>

3124
01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that if they,</v>

3125
01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:25.170
<v Speaker 1>if they need a bunch of steps before they get the isolation tanks,</v>

3126
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't just let dude's fucking climate a tank of water dudes with jumping in</v>

3127
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:29.021
<v Speaker 1>there with them and,</v>

3128
01:25:29.021 --> 01:25:29.854
<v Speaker 1>but fucking him.</v>

3129
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>She'd have to control all that.</v>

3130
01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Would have way too much salt in it.</v>

3131
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3132
01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:35.051
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3133
01:25:35.051 --> 01:25:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in favor of rewarding prisoners would shit that.</v>

3134
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it to figure out a way to,</v>

3135
01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:39.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3136
01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3137
01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>counsel them to,</v>

3138
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3139
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:43.120
<v Speaker 1>integrate them back in society.</v>

3140
01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think the system that they have right now is the right way to do it.</v>

3141
01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>But if I was a fucking victim or the family of a victim and there's some dude</v>

3142
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:51.340
<v Speaker 1>who's getting an isolation tank and I can't afford it,</v>

3143
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:51.671
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3144
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:52.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3145
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3146
01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they deserve that shit.</v>

3147
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:55.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just you,</v>

3148
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to punish people and you have to set an example for doing shitty things</v>

3149
01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not like drug related nonviolent crimes,</v>

3150
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:02.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3151
01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:02.591
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3152
01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:02.731
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3153
01:26:02.731 --> 01:26:03.770
<v Speaker 1>he had a of pot on him,</v>

3154
01:26:03.771 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>now he's</v>

3155
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.581
<v Speaker 4>in jail.</v>

3156
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:04.731
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3157
01:26:04.731 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 4>that kind of nonsense when you watch locked up raw and you see the way these</v>

3158
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:09.531
<v Speaker 4>guys are being treated,</v>

3159
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:10.360
<v Speaker 4>they're freaking out.</v>

3160
01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3161
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.280
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>

3162
01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3163
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:12.440
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3164
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.273
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

3165
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Vengeance.</v>

3166
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>And I understand that desire for vengeance from the family,</v>

3167
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 4>but isn't there like a bigger picture here?</v>

3168
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 4>Which is that,</v>

3169
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.841
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3170
01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 4>you want vengeance,</v>

3171
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 4>but that's just part of the same problem is that this part of the same problem,</v>

3172
01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is this person is not going to get any better if you let them</v>

3173
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 4>out and they don't learn anything from this,</v>

3174
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 4>they don't suffer.</v>

3175
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:31.011
<v Speaker 4>And guess what?</v>

3176
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Nothing changed it and you leave them in what?</v>

3177
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Nothing changes either.</v>

3178
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 4>They didn't beat up.</v>

3179
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they learn anything from the current way they they're treated,</v>

3180
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 4>but at least the victims have the satisfaction of knowing that this person has</v>

3181
01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 4>to pay for their suffering,</v>

3182
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:45.830
<v Speaker 4>which is great until that fucking person gets let out.</v>

3183
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 4>It would have been don't ever four months,</v>

3184
01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:48.350
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them do.</v>

3185
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.863
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3186
01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.331
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly.</v>

3187
01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 4>So now you got your,</v>

3188
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 4>your your fucking pound of flesh.</v>

3189
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 4>This guy got raped for 10 years.</v>

3190
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 4>He got addicted to foot,</v>

3191
01:26:56.121 --> 01:27:00.140
<v Speaker 4>some weird drug and now he's out in the streets and he's going to do it again.</v>

3192
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3193
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 4>And then that spreads more.</v>

3194
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 4>That spreads more of taking like very,</v>

3195
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 4>very like very specific examples.</v>

3196
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:10.430
<v Speaker 4>But it's more important than anything to protect people from people that want to</v>

3197
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:11.240
<v Speaker 4>harm them.</v>

3198
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 4>That's the most important thing.</v>

3199
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:13.910
<v Speaker 4>So if anybody's is violent,</v>

3200
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.960
<v Speaker 4>if anybody's dangerous,</v>

3201
01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 4>they need to be locked up.</v>

3202
01:27:15.921 --> 01:27:18.810
<v Speaker 4>And if they don't learn or if you don't think that they're there,</v>

3203
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:21.140
<v Speaker 4>they have a real objective assessment.</v>

3204
01:27:21.141 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 4>And I think that this guy is going to go back and get revenge,</v>

3205
01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 4>should never be let out.</v>

3206
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.111
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3207
01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I was reading Mckenna talking about you.</v>

3208
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.830
<v Speaker 4>How do you diagnose that?</v>

3209
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I was correctly make that call and not imprison someone for life because you</v>

3210
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 4>don't like them.</v>

3211
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 4>But leary and uh,</v>

3212
01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 4>back in the 60s,</v>

3213
01:27:35.061 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 4>they were doing experiments with,</v>

3214
01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was LSD or psilocybin with prisoners,</v>

3215
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 4>and the effect was tremendous.</v>

3216
01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.390
<v Speaker 4>It was changing them and transforming them.</v>

3217
01:27:44.410 --> 01:27:44.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

3218
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:46.490
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what I'm saying.</v>

3219
01:27:46.491 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's a better option.</v>

3220
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3221
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Hank is too complicated.</v>

3222
01:27:49.941 --> 01:27:50.391
<v Speaker 4>The tank.</v>

3223
01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 4>You need too much control of yourself.</v>

3224
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.080
<v Speaker 4>You need to be able to be calm and relaxed.</v>

3225
01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:55.130
<v Speaker 4>You need to be able to let go,</v>

3226
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:55.671
<v Speaker 4>to use it.</v>

3227
01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 4>You need to not piss and jerk off in there.</v>

3228
01:27:57.411 --> 01:27:58.244
<v Speaker 4>You fuckhead</v>

3229
01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.380
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3230
01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3231
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to leave that to the prisoners and I flotation thing.</v>

3232
01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I think we all agree on that.</v>

3233
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Giving the mushrooms will be a way,</v>

3234
01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:07.341
<v Speaker 4>Chet,</v>

3235
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 4>and way better solution and a really good one.</v>

3236
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you wanted to reintegrate them,</v>

3237
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:12.380
<v Speaker 4>you can just create an alternate society.</v>

3238
01:28:12.381 --> 01:28:12.731
<v Speaker 4>We're looking,</v>

3239
01:28:12.731 --> 01:28:13.880
<v Speaker 4>you can't ever go free,</v>

3240
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:18.050
<v Speaker 4>but how about we only have the mushroom taking population segmented off from the</v>

3241
01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 4>rest of everybody else and we'll give you guys a chance to reestablish a</v>

3242
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:21.590
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

3243
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 4>We have a giant track of land.</v>

3244
01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:24.200
<v Speaker 4>You have gps trips on.</v>

3245
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Don't try to escape.</v>

3246
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.250
<v Speaker 4>We're going to put the GPS trip into muscular and your body,</v>

3247
01:28:28.251 --> 01:28:29.061
<v Speaker 4>if you cut it out,</v>

3248
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 4>it will register in the computer.</v>

3249
01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 4>You go back to jail for the rest of your term plus parole.</v>

3250
01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 4>No questions asked.</v>

3251
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:36.890
<v Speaker 4>So take the mushrooms and you live in this little place in the village like a</v>

3252
01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 4>fucking m night Shama Lama Ding Dong movie.</v>

3253
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:40.820
<v Speaker 4>And everybody goes out there by themselves,</v>

3254
01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:42.350
<v Speaker 4>completely disconnected from society.</v>

3255
01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:43.430
<v Speaker 4>And let's do it as an experiment.</v>

3256
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Let's take all these fucked up prisoners and make them eat mushrooms,</v>

3257
01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.170
<v Speaker 4>take the most violent,</v>

3258
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:48.981
<v Speaker 4>the most fucked up,</v>

3259
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:51.410
<v Speaker 4>the craziest and let them talk to the spirit world.</v>

3260
01:28:51.411 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 4>Five grams all the time,</v>

3261
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.260
<v Speaker 4>all day sun,</v>

3262
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.490
<v Speaker 4>all day sun.</v>

3263
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 4>We're going to watch them evolve right before [inaudible] gain trips every</v>

3264
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.091
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>

3265
01:28:59.091 --> 01:29:00.920
<v Speaker 4>every month they have scheduled people game trips.</v>

3266
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>These motherfuckers are going to do</v>

3267
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 3>IOWASCA.</v>

3268
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:06.270
<v Speaker 3>We're going to give them a full psychedelic reevaluation,</v>

3269
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 3>but how amazing would it be if instead of having to send them to their plot of</v>

3270
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:10.590
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

3271
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:12.720
<v Speaker 3>what if when people came out of prison,</v>

3272
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:16.290
<v Speaker 3>because we were so advanced and we understood the psychology so well,</v>

3273
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:17.820
<v Speaker 3>people came out of prison.</v>

3274
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 3>They were like professors.</v>

3275
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 3>There were a million times better and then there are helping society.</v>

3276
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Problem is there's too many.</v>

3277
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.500
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough money.</v>

3278
01:29:25.501 --> 01:29:26.191
<v Speaker 3>There's too many,</v>

3279
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:27.450
<v Speaker 3>there's too many fucking people.</v>

3280
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:29.430
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people that are so far gone.</v>

3281
01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:32.340
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to do something special to make them change.</v>

3282
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That's where my mushroom plantation comes in.</v>

3283
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

3284
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I like the Rogan mushroom plantation,</v>

3285
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think that Duncan Trussell LSD egg is much better,</v>

3286
01:29:41.401 --> 01:29:45.690
<v Speaker 3>which is an egg shaped thing that prisoners go in for many,</v>

3287
01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:49.990
<v Speaker 3>many years until their egos completely erased there reprogrammed with only</v>

3288
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:51.660
<v Speaker 3>positive teachings.</v>

3289
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 3>They learn about Buddhism,</v>

3290
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:54.460
<v Speaker 3>all the world religions and they,</v>

3291
01:29:54.461 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 3>you pop them back out into society.</v>

3292
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you start with six,</v>

3293
01:29:56.881 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 3>seven but you pop them back out into society and now instead of putting the</v>

3294
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 3>poison back into society,</v>

3295
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you're putting a,</v>

3296
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.713
<v Speaker 3>an antidote.</v>

3297
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a beautiful idea in theory,</v>

3298
01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 3>but that's so far away from being able to be done.</v>

3299
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.181
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3300
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:10.620
<v Speaker 3>we're talking science fiction there.</v>

3301
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:11.041
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3302
01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not science fiction.</v>

3303
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's not yet.</v>

3304
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 3>We're not yet capable of it,</v>

3305
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:16.380
<v Speaker 3>but mushrooms are here right now.</v>

3306
01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.243
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3307
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:17.941
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3308
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:19.560
<v Speaker 3>This site within inducing,</v>

3309
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:19.981
<v Speaker 3>so you're,</v>

3310
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you're saying this is a much,</v>

3311
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I lost you.</v>

3312
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:23.280
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying.</v>

3313
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.570
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is you put prisoners in some sort of like chamber,</v>

3314
01:30:27.571 --> 01:30:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

3315
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Like you inject them with it or something and you just like have them.</v>

3316
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:33.270
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same thing you said.</v>

3317
01:30:33.271 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 3>I was just still,</v>

3318
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 3>I was being a little too uh weird about it because then you would created some</v>

3319
01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:40.040
<v Speaker 3>alternate reality where you can waste their memories.</v>

3320
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3321
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I think if you gave someone enough LSD you would raise their memory.</v>

3322
01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:44.820
<v Speaker 3>But in my,</v>

3323
01:30:44.821 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>in my mind it's like an like an egg like thing where you pretty attached to this</v>

3324
01:30:49.261 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 3>is where he lost weight.</v>

3325
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I know it was like what did he die?</v>

3326
01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I see like the spicy,</v>

3327
01:30:52.461 --> 01:30:55.410
<v Speaker 3>it's like this egg like thing and you project on the walls,</v>

3328
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 3>just beautiful images.</v>

3329
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like a more gag he came out.</v>

3330
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3331
01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 3>so it's a mortgage.</v>

3332
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Nailed it son.</v>

3333
01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.110
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3334
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Pulled out the greatest all time references a mark egg.</v>

3335
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't remember that.</v>

3336
01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 3>A more egg was a real thing until you brought that up.</v>

3337
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Well the morgue equity and I've always wanted one of those.</v>

3338
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:16.680
<v Speaker 3>No because we do give some knuckles on the mortgage reference.</v>

3339
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.830
<v Speaker 3>But you guys both need to try and read Ben Prison idea because it was way better</v>

3340
01:31:22.831 --> 01:31:24.640
<v Speaker 3>than the Duncan Trussell prison idea.</v>

3341
01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.810
<v Speaker 3>What does it just make them bomb sniffer dogs and taking,</v>

3342
01:31:27.811 --> 01:31:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:29.700
<v Speaker 3>use prisoners for things like that.</v>

3344
01:31:29.701 --> 01:31:29.851
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3345
01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3346
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:31.300
<v Speaker 3>we might have a bomb in here.</v>

3347
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:32.383
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

3348
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:33.630
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>

3349
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3350
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.291
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3351
01:31:34.291 --> 01:31:34.501
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3352
01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:36.930
<v Speaker 3>the LSD experiments.</v>

3353
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.270
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the MK Ultra.</v>

3354
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3355
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:40.710
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the shit that they did,</v>

3356
01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:44.820
<v Speaker 3>the CIA that turned Ted Kaczynski into the Unabomber supposedly allegedly.</v>

3357
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3358
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 3>the documentary and we talked about in the podcast before,</v>

3359
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I think the documentary is called the net.</v>

3360
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:50.851
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

3361
01:31:50.851 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating.</v>

3362
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting shit.</v>

3363
01:31:53.190 --> 01:31:54.870
<v Speaker 3>So that's what my problem with Lsd,</v>

3364
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:58.920
<v Speaker 3>my palm with LSD is I keep hearing crazy stories about people losing their</v>

3365
01:31:58.930 --> 01:31:59.763
<v Speaker 3>marbles,</v>

3366
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3367
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 4>and Howard Stern's talked about it,</v>

3368
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 4>how he took it once and he took too much of it and he had this horrifying scary</v>

3369
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:06.064
<v Speaker 4>fucking trip.</v>

3370
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:06.581
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3371
01:32:06.581 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 4>and where he was like losing his mind.</v>

3372
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:09.820
<v Speaker 4>And then the drummer from pink Floyd,</v>

3373
01:32:09.821 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 4>the Joey Diaz always talks about,</v>

3374
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 4>did some fucking LSD lost his mind?</v>

3375
01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the dude's name.</v>

3376
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Sid Barrett.</v>

3377
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:16.263
<v Speaker 4>Is that his name?</v>

3378
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:16.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3379
01:32:16.841 --> 01:32:17.631
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the whole story?</v>

3380
01:32:17.631 --> 01:32:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was a drummer,</v>

3381
01:32:18.521 --> 01:32:18.831
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

3382
01:32:18.831 --> 01:32:19.121
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3383
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3384
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.960
<v Speaker 4>What did he,</v>

3385
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.890
<v Speaker 4>was the guitar player,</v>

3386
01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 4>was he?</v>

3387
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:21.671
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3388
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3389
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>he was like a singer and I think he was like one of the founders of it or</v>

3390
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:26.591
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3391
01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3392
01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:27.461
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3393
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:27.701
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3394
01:32:27.701 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 4>the story goes that he just,</v>

3395
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.910
<v Speaker 4>they were all tripping out so much,</v>

3396
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:31.744
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

3397
01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I think he became a schizophrenia or a shut in and London or something.</v>

3398
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:36.190
<v Speaker 4>And then he's,</v>

3399
01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.023
<v Speaker 4>he died,</v>

3400
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.170
<v Speaker 4>he's deputy release him.</v>

3401

<v Speaker 4>Syd Barrett,</v>

3405
01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 4>or at least some snows do or the allegedly believed it was due to an LSD trip.</v>

3406
01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Like it was.</v>

3407
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3408

3409
01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:49.480
<v Speaker 4>he went crazy from it.</v>

3410
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.150
<v Speaker 4>He did like Lsd and just lost his mother.</v>

3411
01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

3413
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:52.420
<v Speaker 4>you hear about them,</v>

3414
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 4>you don't hear about that with mushrooms.</v>

3415
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3416
01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Although that's not totally true because Dennis Mckenna,</v>

3417
01:32:57.430 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna's brother apparently lost it for a long time.</v>

3418
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:05.350
<v Speaker 4>They had some big crazy mushroom trip down in central America or South America,</v>

3419
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:10.680
<v Speaker 4>and he was gone for like two weeks where he was like in this complete like fit</v>

3420
01:33:11.141 --> 01:33:11.930
<v Speaker 4>of madness.</v>

3421
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:12.763
<v Speaker 4>It was just a,</v>

3422
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.770
<v Speaker 4>shit happens a lot with mushrooms.</v>

3423
01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3424
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.521
<v Speaker 4>Growing up,</v>

3425
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:16.380
<v Speaker 4>and when I used to do mushrooms,</v>

3426
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.770
<v Speaker 4>a lie,</v>

3427
01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:18.430
<v Speaker 4>a lot of my friends had the same shit where you're like,</v>

3428
01:33:18.431 --> 01:33:19.730
<v Speaker 4>what happened to so and so?</v>

3429
01:33:19.731 --> 01:33:20.020
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

3430
01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:20.141
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3431
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen him for like a week.</v>

3432
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:21.821
<v Speaker 4>And they knew it came.</v>

3433
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:22.631
<v Speaker 4>He comes back and say,</v>

3434
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:22.841
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3435
01:33:22.841 --> 01:33:23.051
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

3436
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:24.070
<v Speaker 4>it's a really bad trip.</v>

3437
01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I just sat in my house for a week and thought about things.</v>

3438
01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3439
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:29.140
<v Speaker 4>I've had that a few times at the top.</v>

3440
01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:29.880
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

3441
01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3442
01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.470
<v Speaker 4>do you think that Dennis,</v>

3443
01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 4>just an overwhelming amount of silicide Ben and they just couldn't process it,</v>

3444
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:39.610
<v Speaker 4>or do you think that it was a very bad time in their life when they took it?</v>

3445
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And then there's some sort of an internal struggle between the experience of</v>

3446
01:33:43.271 --> 01:33:44.260
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience,</v>

3447
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:49.261
<v Speaker 4>which requires absolute truth and honesty and all the issues that you might have</v>

3448
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:51.730
<v Speaker 4>not resolved in your own mind?</v>

3449
01:33:51.731 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly fucking with your psyche.</v>

3450
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:58.180
<v Speaker 4>So then a battle takes place between the psychedelic truth and all the shit that</v>

3451
01:33:58.181 --> 01:34:01.990
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to keep him in the closet in the dark and all the douchey behavior</v>

3452
01:34:01.991 --> 01:34:06.991
<v Speaker 4>and all life and stress and death and it's sucking dicks and airplanes getting</v>

3453
01:34:07.031 --> 01:34:12.031
<v Speaker 4>hit by missiles and it all just falls apart and your mind literally cannot grab</v>

3454
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:12.890
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

3455
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 4>It's just madness where this like defragging before your eyes and information is</v>

3456
01:34:17.801 --> 01:34:18.521
<v Speaker 4>crumbling.</v>

3457
01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Your ability to decode the language,</v>

3458
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:24.520
<v Speaker 4>it's all desolving like you fuck your whole brain sideways.</v>

3459
01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 4>And apparently for like two weeks he was gone.</v>

3460
01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.330
<v Speaker 4>But that's when you need a Sharman or somebody,</v>

3461
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:30.630
<v Speaker 4>somebody could talk you down,</v>

3462
01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:33.220
<v Speaker 4>lead you through that because that means you're at the right place.</v>

3463
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:36.150
<v Speaker 4>That's when the healing starts is they've pulled all the fuck there.</v>

3464
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 4>There's scrubbing the terms of your ego away and all of a sudden you're in this</v>

3465
01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 4>open place and if you're with someone who knows what they're doing,</v>

3466
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:44.320
<v Speaker 4>who really knows what they're doing,</v>

3467
01:34:44.321 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 4>then you can like evolve at that moment and become something like so much</v>

3468
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 4>happier and more real than you are.</v>

3469
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:50.951
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3470
01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:54.100
<v Speaker 4>that's the sad thing about it is no one knows how to do that.</v>

3471
01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:54.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

3472
01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>the kids are like fucking tripping on psychedelics and</v>

3473
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 5>having rotten trips.</v>

3474
01:34:59.250 --> 01:34:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3475
01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:00.750
<v Speaker 3>No one knows how to.</v>

3476
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:01.410
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

3477
01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:02.250
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to do it.</v>

3478
01:35:02.251 --> 01:35:04.170
<v Speaker 3>And also they're coming from a who you know,</v>

3479
01:35:04.171 --> 01:35:08.220
<v Speaker 3>who knows what their view of the world is and how far it is off from reality.</v>

3480
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's one thing about all psychedelic trips is they force you.</v>

3481
01:35:11.521 --> 01:35:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Before we go any further,</v>

3482
01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see your ticket and I'd like to see your ticket is here is your real</v>

3483
01:35:16.801 --> 01:35:17.820
<v Speaker 3>life for real.</v>

3484
01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.271
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3485
01:35:18.271 --> 01:35:23.271
<v Speaker 3>So before we go and talk to any fucking flying blue dragons and a take you into</v>

3486
01:35:23.431 --> 01:35:24.760
<v Speaker 3>the center of the universe and,</v>

3487
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.950
<v Speaker 3>and show you the,</v>

3488
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.150
<v Speaker 3>the fabric of life.</v>

3489
01:35:27.151 --> 01:35:30.150
<v Speaker 3>It's under the hood of the car of the universe.</v>

3490
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Before we do that,</v>

3491
01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.490
<v Speaker 3>here's you.</v>

3492
01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.430
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes the drugs affect different people in different ways.</v>

3493
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.353
<v Speaker 3>Other than that though,</v>

3494
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I think I've said this before,</v>

3495
01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:38.763
<v Speaker 3>this girl I knew,</v>

3496
01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:39.720
<v Speaker 3>she hit one,</v>

3497
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3498
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.830
<v Speaker 3>bong once and she just took off running as fast as she could into my bathroom</v>

3499
01:35:43.831 --> 01:35:45.810
<v Speaker 3>and hit the tub and fell against the wall and stuff.</v>

3500
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.130
<v Speaker 3>But when she came back to it,</v>

3501
01:35:47.131 --> 01:35:47.521
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

3502
01:35:47.521 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember doing it.</v>

3503
01:35:48.571 --> 01:35:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why I did that.</v>

3504
01:35:49.561 --> 01:35:50.100
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3505
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:52.080
<v Speaker 3>what one hit from we made you do this.</v>

3506
01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Don't ever touch we'd ever again.</v>

3507
01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3508
01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:54.841
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

3509
01:35:54.841 --> 01:35:55.141
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3510
01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3511
01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope doesn't like weed.</v>

3512
01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.001
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3513
01:35:57.001 --> 01:35:58.350
<v Speaker 3>he'll tell you I don't like what it does to me.</v>

3514
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3515
01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.260
<v Speaker 3>And Santo Bikes,</v>

3516
01:35:59.260 --> 01:35:59.940
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3517
01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3518
01:36:00.181 --> 01:36:01.440
<v Speaker 3>he's a mushroom efficient.</v>

3519
01:36:01.441 --> 01:36:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Mando you know,</v>

3520
01:36:02.611 --> 01:36:02.831
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3521
01:36:02.831 --> 01:36:06.870
<v Speaker 3>he's probably taken 30 times more drugs and I have,</v>

3522
01:36:06.871 --> 01:36:08.310
<v Speaker 3>he'll hope to fucking take anything.</v>

3523
01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 5>I heard this story,</v>

3524
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.080
<v Speaker 5>I was reading the biography of Timothy leary and I can't remember the name of it</v>

3525
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:14.720
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

3526
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.471
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of them,</v>

3527
01:36:15.471 --> 01:36:15.831
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

3528
01:36:15.831 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 5>But the one I was reading,</v>

3529
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:20.630
<v Speaker 5>there was a reporter who was at the house where they were all tripping out and</v>

3530
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3531
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 5>he was like watching them.</v>

3532
01:36:22.431 --> 01:36:23.220
<v Speaker 5>He's kind of like a net.</v>

3533
01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:26.360
<v Speaker 5>He was like apparently going to do a negative story on them or something.</v>

3534
01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.120
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3535
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:27.441
<v Speaker 5>cause you know,</v>

3536
01:36:27.441 --> 01:36:27.621
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

3537
01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3538
01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 5>leary was up in this house with a bunch of hippies like,</v>

3539
01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:30.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3540
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.810
<v Speaker 5>Alan Ginsburg and Richard Alpert and like a lot of the,</v>

3541
01:36:33.811 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 5>the beat to people from the 60s and they were all experimenting with acid.</v>

3542
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:43.421
<v Speaker 5>But this reporter apparently snuck into Timothy Leary's office where under his</v>

3543
01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:45.990
<v Speaker 5>office in a drawer and the cantor,</v>

3544
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 5>he had a liquid acid,</v>

3545
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:48.440
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3546
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 5>it thinking it was vodka or some kind of alcohol poured himself a drink.</v>

3547
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3548
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3549
01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

3550
01:36:55.281 --> 01:36:55.520
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3551
01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.940
<v Speaker 5>Did this massive amount of acid not even knowing it.</v>

3552
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.960
<v Speaker 5>And so we started having this incredibly terrible trip and they say he took his</v>

3553
01:37:02.961 --> 01:37:03.531
<v Speaker 5>clothes off.</v>

3554
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:05.450
<v Speaker 5>He was running around the grounds naked,</v>

3576
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:32.260
<v Speaker 3>The thing about Hari Krishna is you can sing it,</v>

3577
01:37:32.261 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 3>which is called a curtain,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to sing.</v>

3659
01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:47.430
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we were even considering that,</v>

3660
01:38:47.431 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 4>that might be entertaining for other people.</v>

3661
01:38:48.841 --> 01:38:49.671
<v Speaker 4>Listening shows you what?</v>

3662
01:38:49.671 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 4>State of consciousness where you right now and mantras there really is weird.</v>

3663
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

3664
01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a weird feeling.</v>

3665
01:38:54.841 --> 01:38:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Does in Mantras,</v>

3666
01:38:56.241 --> 01:38:57.120
<v Speaker 4>they're great because,</v>

3667
01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:57.721
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>whatever the one is you decided to do,</v>

3669
01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:00.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3670
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.230
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a chance to focus your mind on something outside your thoughts.</v>

3671
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Because do that.</v>

3672
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:05.791
<v Speaker 4>After Yoga,</v>

3673
01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I do ohms.</v>

3674
01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:07.461
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3675
01:39:07.461 --> 01:39:11.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm to look along own session in like the Lotus position.</v>

3676
01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.553
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that.</v>

3677
01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:14.520
<v Speaker 4>It seems so silly and pretentious while you're doing it.</v>

3678
01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.001
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3679
01:39:15.001 --> 01:39:15.071
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3680
01:39:15.071 --> 01:39:15.930
<v Speaker 4>got a fucking faggot.</v>

3681
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:16.764
<v Speaker 4>I am right now.</v>

3682
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3683
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.870
<v Speaker 4>my friends walked in on me from high school.</v>

3684
01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:18.991
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3685
01:39:18.991 --> 01:39:19.410
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

3686
01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Stupid fucking,</v>

3687
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

3688
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 4>You would suck up a couple of Dick's after this and eat some berries.</v>

3689
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:25.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not presents.</v>

3690
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:26.690
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like I,</v>

3691
01:39:26.691 --> 01:39:26.880
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3692
01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:27.930
<v Speaker 4>it's of course it's not pretentious,</v>

3693
01:39:27.931 --> 01:39:28.764
<v Speaker 4>but there's a,</v>

3694
01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:33.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain amount of silliness that's attached to any yoga spirituality.</v>

3695
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Even if you say you're a Vegan or something,</v>

3696
01:39:37.261 --> 01:39:37.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3697
01:39:37.501 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 4>you're an environmentalist.</v>

3698
01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:40.600
<v Speaker 4>Anytime there's anything caring in,</v>

3699
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 4>in any sort of consideration,</v>

3700
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 4>there's like a bunch of weakness attached to it.</v>

3701
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody catches you sitting there in the Lotus position with your,</v>

3702
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:48.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3703
01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 4>your fuck you finger touching your thumb going,</v>

3704
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:51.740
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.700
<v Speaker 4>like you silly bitch.</v>

3706
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:55.290

3707
01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:55.590
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

3708
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:56.220
<v Speaker 4>did you go,</v>

3709
01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh mom,</v>

3710
01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 4>Amari do long.</v>

3711
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:59.303
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3712
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:10.390
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3713
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.633
<v Speaker 4>that's what I do.</v>

3714
01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.600
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

3715
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 4>I do long ones.</v>

3716
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I do that sometimes in the tank to a tank gets even weirder because it</v>

3717
01:40:19.561 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 4>reverberates to the water.</v>

3718
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 4>And I do that when I need to slow my mind down and need to,</v>

3719
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 4>like when I get into the tank sometimes it's like as there's an adjustment</v>

3720
01:40:28.081 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 4>period of like a few minutes,</v>

3721
01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:32.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to relax and settle in and get loose.</v>

3722
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:32.421
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3723
01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:32.631
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3724
01:40:32.631 --> 01:40:32.841
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3725
01:40:32.841 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 4>and just settle into the experience.</v>

3726
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:35.760
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes I just can't,</v>

3727
01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:36.810
<v Speaker 4>it's just too much on my mind.</v>

3728
01:40:36.811 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 4>I got too much fucking going on,</v>

3729
01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:40.200
<v Speaker 4>too much real life TM bullshit,</v>

3730
01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:40.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3731
01:40:40.651 --> 01:40:41.850
<v Speaker 4>invading my consciousness.</v>

3732
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.571
<v Speaker 4>So then I go,</v>

3733
01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:43.404
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3734
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:46.410
<v Speaker 4>and I just only think about my breathing,</v>

3735
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:48.060
<v Speaker 4>my breathing and making that noise.</v>

3736
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>And then it,</v>

3737
01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 4>eventually I stopped thinking about my breathing and the breathing you just</v>

3738
01:40:52.831 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>comes automatically deep</v>

3739
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.401
<v Speaker 3>and long.</v>

3740
01:40:54.401 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 3>And I just think about hitting the right note and then I'm like,</v>

3741
01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:58.810
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3742
01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:01.650
<v Speaker 10>oh.</v>

3743
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's like a certain relaxation to it when you really hit it,</v>

3744
01:41:04.890 --> 01:41:05.730
<v Speaker 3>when you're faking it,</v>

3745
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.780
<v Speaker 3>when you're nervous about it,</v>

3746
01:41:06.781 --> 01:41:07.440
<v Speaker 3>then you're like,</v>

3747
01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3748
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3749
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.550
<v Speaker 3>there's like a break in the way you're talking.</v>

3750
01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:14.460
<v Speaker 3>You're not relaxed enough to let that sound come out.</v>

3751
01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 3>What about the Buddhist?</v>

3752
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:16.583
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3753
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.240
<v Speaker 5>it has the graying of the issue,</v>

3754
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:19.970
<v Speaker 5>the gray,</v>

3755
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:20.441
<v Speaker 5>the shit.</v>

3756
01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.370
<v Speaker 5>That shit's insane.</v>

3757
01:41:24.090 --> 01:41:25.130
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3758
01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.320
<v Speaker 5>You sound like one of those instruments.</v>

3759
01:41:27.321 --> 01:41:28.410
<v Speaker 5>What's it called in Australia?</v>

3760
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.211
<v Speaker 5>The jury.</v>

3761
01:41:29.211 --> 01:41:30.140
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

3762

3768
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:47.660
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3769
01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.230
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

3770
01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:53.230
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] it's like this whole prayer.</v>

3786
01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:15.330
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating.</v>

3787

3794
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.760
<v Speaker 3>If you look at this fucking Shiva over here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>All these women with like extra hands and shit.</v>

01:42:56.721 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I ended Hensley.</v>

3804
01:42:57.850 --> 01:42:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I incredible dream.</v>

3805
01:42:59.091 --> 01:42:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Once where,</v>

3806
01:42:59.981 --> 01:43:00.814
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3807
01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:02.570
<v Speaker 3>it was like those things,</v>

3808
01:43:02.571 --> 01:43:04.160
<v Speaker 3>whatever those things were in this dream.</v>

3809
01:43:04.190 --> 01:43:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I was like at a restaurant though.</v>

3810
01:43:05.481 --> 01:43:08.000
<v Speaker 3>But these things that look like Shiva,</v>

3811
01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:08.241
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3812
01:43:08.241 --> 01:43:08.731

3814
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3815
01:43:10.130 --> 01:43:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Angelic Hindu thing,</v>

3816
01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:11.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3817
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:12.200
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

3818
01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:16.460
<v Speaker 3>they came up to me and they were so beautiful and so perfect and always like</v>

3819
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.830
<v Speaker 3>looking at them and for some reason I was like,</v>

3820
01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:19.670
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3821
01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:20.210
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3822
01:43:20.210 --> 01:43:22.040
<v Speaker 3>you look like me.</v>

3823
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.210
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

3824
01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:24.043
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3825
01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 3>you look like us is though to say like humans were a reflection of what they are</v>

3826
01:43:29.811 --> 01:43:30.231
<v Speaker 3>or like,</v>

3827
01:43:30.231 --> 01:43:30.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3828
01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:31.091
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>

3829
01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:34.190
<v Speaker 3>an expansion of like whatever that thing is,</v>

3830
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3831
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:35.470
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

3832
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3833
01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:36.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3834
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:37.820
<v Speaker 3>this awesome,</v>

3835
01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:38.261
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3836
01:43:38.261 --> 01:43:40.850
<v Speaker 3>And of course in Hinduism the is called Maya,</v>

3837
01:43:41.210 --> 01:43:45.920
<v Speaker 3>which means illusion and the way they described this universe is a,</v>

3838
01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.360
<v Speaker 3>it's like the reflection of a forest on a lake.</v>

3839
01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Our is the reflection of this,</v>

3840
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 3>of the true universe.</v>

3841
01:43:54.831 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Like the true universe is so powerful that we're this kind of shimmering,</v>

3842
01:43:58.671 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>weird reflection of it.</v>

3843
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 3>And we all think that we're real and permanent and constant.</v>

3844
01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>And it lasts forever when it's just nothing more than just like a,</v>

3845
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:07.791
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3846
01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:08.624
<v Speaker 3>just some kind of,</v>

01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:12.110
<v Speaker 3>That's not what they call a reality.</v>

3850
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Illusion not real at all.</v>

3851
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Whack is Christianity in comparison to that,</v>

3852

3859
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 3>That's what Ninja would say.</v>

01:44:29.391 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 3>High Level Shit.</v>

01:44:35.421 --> 01:44:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

3869
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:36.381
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3870
01:44:36.381 --> 01:44:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I'd call it next level shit.</v>

3871
01:44:38.031 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

3872
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 3>it's like high level.</v>

3873

<v Speaker 3>It's the next level.</v>

3874
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.590
<v Speaker 3>It's the level.</v>

3875
01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:46.010
<v Speaker 3>It's people zooming into the level and know what it is.</v>

3876
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.640
<v Speaker 3>And the interesting thing about the Hindus,</v>

3877
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 3>they ate a lot of Hash and mushrooms and mushrooms.</v>

3878
01:44:51.130 --> 01:44:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Selma.</v>

3879
01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:52.613
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3880
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Soma,</v>

3881
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:54.900
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know exactly what it is is there's,</v>

3882
01:44:55.110 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Soma is referenced in many of the ancient texts,</v>

3883
01:44:57.681 --> 01:44:57.921
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3884
01:44:57.921 --> 01:45:01.940
<v Speaker 3>And they think it might have been emoney to miscarry and psilocybe cubensis and</v>

3885
01:45:01.941 --> 01:45:03.580
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other shit with mixing together.</v>

3886
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of debate on what it is,</v>

3887
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:08.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's very clear that this something that they ate that made them have</v>

3888
01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:08.751
<v Speaker 3>experienced,</v>

3889
01:45:08.751 --> 01:45:08.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3890
01:45:08.931 --> 01:45:09.764
<v Speaker 3>they're singing,</v>

3891
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.850
<v Speaker 3>we did psychedelics,</v>

3892
01:45:10.851 --> 01:45:11.011
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3893
01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:11.890
<v Speaker 3>we called it Soma.</v>

3894
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what Soma is,</v>

3895
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's very obvious from them what they wrote that it's a psychedelic plant.</v>

3896
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:17.560
<v Speaker 3>There's solid,</v>

3897
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.690
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3898
01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Mccain.</v>

3899
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:23.080
<v Speaker 3>And talks about their rig Veda and the rig Veda is hymns to Selma to that.</v>

3900
01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 3>And they have all these ways of describing it.</v>

3901
01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3902
01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:29.650
<v Speaker 3>and that's the oldest known was have the oldest stone Leviton let know</v>

3903
01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:29.941
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

3904
01:45:29.941 --> 01:45:32.000
<v Speaker 3>a little stone written work that,</v>

3905
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:32.450
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3906
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3907
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3908
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3909
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3910
01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the oldest.</v>

3911
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:38.420
<v Speaker 3>So there's the Upanishads right there.</v>

3912
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:40.760
<v Speaker 3>There's the Mahabharat,</v>

3913
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:42.890
<v Speaker 3>which is what the Bhagavad Gita comes out of.</v>

3914
01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that has all the,</v>

3915
01:45:44.481 --> 01:45:44.781
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>

3916
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>is it called?</v>

3917
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3918
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Vimeo has,</v>

3919
01:45:46.761 --> 01:45:48.620
<v Speaker 3>what is it called when something flies to this guy?</v>

3920
01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3921
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:49.521
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3922
01:45:49.521 --> 01:45:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

3923
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:51.051
<v Speaker 3>I remember the name of it.</v>

3924
01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:53.240
<v Speaker 3>But that's a fascinating take on,</v>

3925
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:53.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3926
01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:53.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3927
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 3>all the Ufo believers believe that in that book.</v>

3928
01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Mahabharata Mahabharata Mahabharata means great India.</v>

3929
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.850
<v Speaker 3>But Rot.</v>

3930
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 3>It's spelled burrata,</v>

3931
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:05.930
<v Speaker 3>but Barat means India and Maha means great.</v>

3932
01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird how we have names for countries other than the names they use?</v>

3933
01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Like Germany is not Germany.</v>

3934
01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 3>It's it's Douche land,</v>

3935
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:14.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3936
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3937
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:15.163
<v Speaker 3>It's not Germany.</v>

3938
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:16.640
<v Speaker 3>And same with um,</v>

3939
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3940
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:18.020
<v Speaker 3>like Greece.</v>

3941
01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Greece is like Hollis or something like that.</v>

3942
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Japan is not Japan.</v>

3943
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:24.143
<v Speaker 3>Nepal,</v>

3944
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 3>it's totally different word.</v>

3945
01:46:25.341 --> 01:46:25.931
<v Speaker 3>And I P p.</v>

3946
01:46:25.931 --> 01:46:26.500
<v Speaker 3>O.</v>

3947
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:26.500
<v Speaker 3>N.</v>

3948
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Walt's obviously in different characters,</v>

3949
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:29.170
<v Speaker 3>but phonetically it's Nippon.</v>

3950
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Nippon Wow.</v>

3951
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3952
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I feel dumb now.</v>

3953
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if Russia is a different name.</v>

3954
01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 3>What is it now?</v>

3955
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3956
01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 3>What was it before?</v>

3957
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Naming something so weird naming like a name for any geography noise you make</v>

3958
01:46:42.201 --> 01:46:43.760
<v Speaker 3>with your mouth that describes a spot.</v>

3959
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:44.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3960
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.071
<v Speaker 3>So fucking,</v>

3961
01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 3>it's such an odd thing in numbers thing we're just to keeping track of,</v>

3962
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:50.461
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3963
01:46:50.461 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 5>I guess it helps traveling.</v>

3964
01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3965
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Helps Gps Kinda need it going to all agree.</v>

3966
01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy that we all agree on red being stopped in green and go,</v>

3967
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 5>that's everywhere in the world.</v>

3968
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 5>Nowhere.</v>

3969
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.030
<v Speaker 5>Nowhere that someone's stubborn.</v>

3970
01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:03.271
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3971
01:47:03.271 --> 01:47:04.290
<v Speaker 5>fuck you bitch.</v>

3972
01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:06.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't even like red dude though.</v>

3973
01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 5>To get back to the India stuff.</v>

3974
01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.740
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I wanted to tell you this story,</v>

3975
01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 5>but stop me if I already told you.</v>

3976
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:16.770
<v Speaker 5>Did I ever tell you that story of like when Richard Alper gave Lsd to his guru</v>

3977
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:17.461
<v Speaker 5>in India?</v>

3978
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:18.294
<v Speaker 5>That story?</v>

3979
01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:19.860
<v Speaker 5>I think we did talk about that,</v>

3980
01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:20.910
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember.</v>

3981

3982
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 5>well I don't know if we talked about it on the podcast,</v>

3983
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:25.350
<v Speaker 5>but I know we talked about it.</v>

3984
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:28.290
<v Speaker 5>We could just kind of whatever shit overlaps this.</v>

3985
01:47:28.291 --> 01:47:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3986
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 5>so Richard Alpert was this guy who,</v>

3987
01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:32.131
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3988

3991
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:40.230
<v Speaker 5>Timothy leary blew his mind on acid or I think it was mushrooms and basically</v>

3992
01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 5>the thing you were talking about happened and where he like,</v>

3993
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 5>cause he was really like rich at the time and he had a nice car and I think I</v>

3994
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 5>like things were really like,</v>

3995
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:49.010
<v Speaker 5>he was like a career.</v>

3996
01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:50.940
<v Speaker 5>Like he was on the up so to speak.</v>

3997
01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 5>And so he took this a psychedelic and saw us life kind of just vanish in front</v>

3998
01:47:56.881 --> 01:47:57.151
<v Speaker 5>of him.</v>

3999
01:47:57.151 --> 01:47:59.070
<v Speaker 5>And he realized that Western society,</v>

4000
01:47:59.071 --> 01:48:04.071
<v Speaker 5>he was obviously a bit of a sham and he ended up going to India because he'd</v>

4001
01:48:04.141 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 5>heard these stories of over there,</v>

4002
01:48:05.611 --> 01:48:05.861
<v Speaker 5>which should,</v>

4003
01:48:05.861 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 5>Albert is Rom dos,</v>

4004
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:07.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4005
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.090
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4006
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.871
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4007
01:48:08.871 --> 01:48:09.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.820
<v Speaker 5>He calls himself during Raam das is his name.</v>

4009
01:48:11.010 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 5>You can get around that star commies.</v>

4010
01:48:12.331 --> 01:48:12.660
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4011
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 5>he wrote be here now.</v>

4012
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.540
<v Speaker 5>But so he has this guru,</v>

4013
01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:19.320
<v Speaker 5>he goes to India and basically finds his guru is this little man and a,</v>

4014
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.220
<v Speaker 5>and a blanket.</v>

4015
01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.820
<v Speaker 5>And Alpert has LSD with them.</v>

4016
01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.770
<v Speaker 5>And according to his story,</v>

4017
01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:27.630
<v Speaker 5>this little guys like you have medicine here,</v>

4018
01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:28.590
<v Speaker 5>you have medicine here.</v>

4019
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:29.783
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

4020
01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.680
<v Speaker 5>Alpert gave him,</v>

4021
01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:32.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4022
01:48:32.221 --> 01:48:32.671
<v Speaker 5>at the time,</v>

4023
01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:35.850
<v Speaker 5>this is acid in the 60s being carried around by like someone who was friends</v>

4024
01:48:35.851 --> 01:48:36.571
<v Speaker 5>with Timothy leary.</v>

4025
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:38.490
<v Speaker 5>So this is high powered shit.</v>

4026
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:40.050
<v Speaker 5>Albert gives him some,</v>

4027
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.130
<v Speaker 5>he eats it,</v>

4028
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.600
<v Speaker 5>eats one of them,</v>

4029
01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:46.140
<v Speaker 5>and then he liked motions for him to give him more and basically eats all of,</v>

4030
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.130
<v Speaker 5>all of his acid,</v>

4031
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:49.050
<v Speaker 5>all of it just gobbles it down.</v>

4032
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:51.510
<v Speaker 5>And so a Alper,</v>

4033
01:48:51.630 --> 01:48:52.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4034

4040
01:48:59.611 --> 01:49:00.270
<v Speaker 5>this story,</v>

4041
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 5>no effect.</v>

4042
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:03.210

01:49:07.971 --> 01:49:08.190
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4050
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:08.911
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

4051
01:49:08.911 --> 01:49:10.050
<v Speaker 5>one thing he said to him was,</v>

4052
01:49:10.051 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 5>this reminds me of a,</v>

4053
01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:13.074
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4054
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.900
<v Speaker 5>this reminds me of something they had in the something valley.</v>

4055
01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.360
<v Speaker 5>Like some,</v>

01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:17.791
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

4057
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:19.080
<v Speaker 5>it reminded them of something and he's like,</v>

4058
01:49:19.081 --> 01:49:19.171
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>

4062
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 5>But so Alper left,</v>

4063
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 5>went back to the United States mind blown by this little man because,</v>

4064
01:49:25.891 --> 01:49:26.341
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

4065
01:49:26.341 --> 01:49:27.174
<v Speaker 5>he tricked me.</v>

4066
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 5>He palmed the shit.</v>

4067
01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.341
<v Speaker 5>He didn't really eat.</v>

4068
01:49:29.341 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 5>It came back,</v>

4069
01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 5>the guy who Albert's swears was telepathic with like,</v>

4070
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:38.910
<v Speaker 5>you don't believe I ate that stuff because Albert had brought more,</v>

4071
01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 5>he took it,</v>

4072
01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:41.460
<v Speaker 5>chewed it up in front of them,</v>

4073
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:42.810
<v Speaker 5>shoot it up in his mouth,</v>

4074
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.540
<v Speaker 5>open his mouth so we could see that it was in his mouth or whatever,</v>

4075
01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:46.374
<v Speaker 5>pill form.</v>

4076
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.333
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

4077
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:48.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4078
01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 3>after some time went under his blanket and started making moaning noises and</v>

4079
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Alvarez like off,</v>

01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:58.480
<v Speaker 3>he aided this time when he went insane and then he came out of his blanket</v>

4082
01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:01.480
<v Speaker 3>laughing cause he's fucking with them and it didn't affect them again,</v>

4083
01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:02.314
<v Speaker 3>no effect.</v>

4084
01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.560
<v Speaker 3>He was just playing into what Albert thought it would have done now,</v>

4085
01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 3>which was driven by somebody so enlightened and he still plays practical jokes.</v>

4086
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:09.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4087
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:09.401

<v Speaker 3>he's a funny,</v>

4089
01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think humor goes away.</v>

4090
01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:11.900
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4091
01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

4092
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Comedians get afraid of like spirituality or meditating or whatever cause</v>

4093
01:50:15.781 --> 01:50:16.061
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

4094
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:17.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to not be funny anymore,</v>

4095
01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:18.101
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4096
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:19.750
<v Speaker 3>I used to think exactly that thing.</v>

4097
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:20.831
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that,</v>

4098
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it funny goes away.</v>

4099
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it just gets better.</v>

4100
01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:23.990
<v Speaker 3>It gets better.</v>

4101
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.620
<v Speaker 3>It gets better.</v>

4102
01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.451
<v Speaker 3>The more at peace you are,</v>

4103
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:26.410
<v Speaker 3>the more funny you are.</v>

4104
01:50:26.411 --> 01:50:28.070
<v Speaker 3>If I'm the worst I'm ever</v>

<v Speaker 6>I watched it.</v>

4127
01:50:55.161 --> 01:50:58.160
<v Speaker 6>I had to watch it twice the first time I was too tired when I watched it and I</v>

4128
01:50:58.161 --> 01:50:59.180
<v Speaker 6>didn't appreciate it that much.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And then the second time I watched it and I was like way more awake and I was</v>

<v Speaker 6>under the influence of the devil's cabbage.</v>

4131
01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.830
<v Speaker 6>I tried watching it the first time.</v>

01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:44.931
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

01:54:54.711 --> 01:54:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to show you guys a video,</v>

4297
01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna talk about it while I'm ducking looks for this.</v>

4298
01:54:58.730 --> 01:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Germany,</v>

4299
01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:04.750
<v Speaker 1>there was a station that had a 24 hour camera that was on the pilgrimage at</v>

4300
01:55:05.841 --> 01:55:06.674
<v Speaker 1>Mecca.</v>

4301
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

4302
01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And for 24 hours a day,</v>

4303
01:55:10.161 --> 01:55:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it just showed these people putting on these white robes and moving around this</v>

4304
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:15.531
<v Speaker 1>square.</v>

4305
01:55:15.531 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 1>What does that square man,</v>

4306
01:55:16.610 --> 01:55:17.361
<v Speaker 1>what is the deal with that?</v>

4307
01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>

4308
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:21.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't it called the now that hodge now,</v>

4309
01:55:21.561 --> 01:55:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing I think is called the Hodgetts caught the Hodges like a</v>

4310
01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.084
<v Speaker 1>pilgrimage.</v>

4311
01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Pilgrimage.</v>

4312
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:29.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4313
01:55:29.631 --> 01:55:29.931
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

4314
01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:31.310
<v Speaker 1>this thing is,</v>

4315
01:55:31.311 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 1>this does big box that's in the center of the square and there's like,</v>

4316
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it's really beautiful,</v>

4317
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:38.420
<v Speaker 1>like incredible architecture.</v>

4318
01:55:38.421 --> 01:55:38.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4319
01:55:38.571 --> 01:55:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking amazing and everyone's super well behaved,</v>

4320
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4321
01:55:42.321 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no one getting arguments or anything</v>

4322
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.490
<v Speaker 3>and they're all like in close proximity to each other and they're touching each</v>

4323
01:55:47.491 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 3>other and they're walking around in a circle around this box 24 hours a day.</v>

4324
01:55:51.691 --> 01:55:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I watched it for an hour and a half to sit in there with my jaw open like wow,</v>

4325
01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:57.473
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

4326
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 3>And it Dunkin had sent me this video once of 'em,</v>

4327
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I sent him a video of a ants or we both had seen it rather of ants in a death</v>

4328
01:56:06.331 --> 01:56:07.164
<v Speaker 3>spiral,</v>

4329
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.890
<v Speaker 3>maybe weed.</v>

4330
01:56:07.890 --> 01:56:08.780
<v Speaker 3>What was the reason for it?</v>

4331
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Like the one of the Queen had died and he tweeted it and it's this.</v>

4332
01:56:11.911 --> 01:56:12.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4333
01:56:12.181 --> 01:56:12.361
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4334
01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 3>The reason is is because like ants follow each other's trail and so basically</v>

4335
01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 3>they end up following a trail and they're wrong.</v>

4336
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>They're basically just end up going in a circle following the same trail.</v>

4337
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:23.933
<v Speaker 3>How does that happen?</v>

4338
01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Because I want to add fucks.</v>

4339
01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 3>It fucks up or the queen fucks up or something.</v>

4340
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.450
<v Speaker 3>And so they followed it.</v>

4341
01:56:30.451 --> 01:56:34.020
<v Speaker 3>So you get the entire nest of ants all going in this circle that looks like this</v>

4342
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:35.130
<v Speaker 3>beautiful spiral.</v>

4343
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:36.023
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

4344
01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4345
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:37.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's available online.</v>

4346
01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:41.560
<v Speaker 3>It's called the the ant death spiral spiral is what it's is.</v>

4347
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause they all just sent me this video of them doing that at Mecca.</v>

4348
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:47.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like almost the exact same thing.</v>

4349
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:48.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4350
01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 3>it looks exactly the same except they don't die.</v>

4351
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.691
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

4352
01:56:51.691 --> 01:56:52.230
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4353
01:56:52.230 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 3>this desire to go run in a circle.</v>

4354
01:56:53.941 --> 01:56:55.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not just walking up that thing and touching it.</v>

4355
01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 3>They're walking around it and they're walking around.</v>

4356
01:56:58.081 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 3>It just covered in robes.</v>

4357
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're basically dressed like they were dressed thousands of years ago.</v>

4358
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:02.521
<v Speaker 3>Well they're actually,</v>

4359
01:57:02.521 --> 01:57:06.870
<v Speaker 3>there was just a video on CNN if this guy went there with like those with that,</v>

4360
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.131
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

4361
01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:11.910
<v Speaker 3>The things edits had those weird silver like disks.</v>

4362
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:14.430
<v Speaker 3>They used to record stuff or like cone things.</v>

4363
01:57:14.431 --> 01:57:15.264
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

4364
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.631
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

4365
01:57:15.631 --> 01:57:20.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like this thing from like a very long time ago of Mecca with the recording</v>

4366
01:57:20.551 --> 01:57:24.390
<v Speaker 3>from back then showing like the city around it and stuff and it was just much</v>

4367
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:27.750
<v Speaker 3>more dilapidated and less built up at the same fucking thing.</v>

4368
01:57:27.751 --> 01:57:28.021
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

4369
01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 3>All of them Muslims going around that.</v>

4370
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:33.990
<v Speaker 3>It's an an amazing that they've committed to that for so long.</v>

4371
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:34.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4372
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:36.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a fascinating thing.</v>

4373
01:57:36.061 --> 01:57:36.781
<v Speaker 3>When I was watching that,</v>

4374
01:57:36.781 --> 01:57:37.111
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4375
01:57:37.111 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 3>if this,</v>

4376
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.150
<v Speaker 3>this is thousands of years old,</v>

4377
01:57:39.151 --> 01:57:39.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4378
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Islam is over a thousand years old,</v>

4379
01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:41.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4380
01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:43.020
<v Speaker 3>So 1500 1500 years old,</v>

4381
01:57:43.021 --> 01:57:43.610
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

4382
01:57:43.610 --> 01:57:44.131
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4383
01:57:44.131 --> 01:57:44.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4384
01:57:44.371 --> 01:57:44.651
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4385
01:57:44.651 --> 01:57:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4386
01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:45.230
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

4387
01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>

4388
01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:46.500
<v Speaker 3>it's very old.</v>

4389
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.333
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4390
01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 3>If this had happened now,</v>

4391
01:57:48.721 --> 01:57:49.800
<v Speaker 3>if this was a new thing,</v>

4392
01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 3>if we were watching a new thing and there was a channel on television that was</v>

4393
01:57:52.441 --> 01:57:56.010
<v Speaker 3>dedicated 24 hours to these new people that wear robes and walk around in a</v>

4394
01:57:56.011 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 3>circle where there's a sacred box cause they have to come to from all over the</v>

4395
01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:03.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking world and they just spend hours and hours walk around the circle to this</v>

4396
01:58:03.451 --> 01:58:03.870
<v Speaker 3>box,</v>

4397
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:06.390
<v Speaker 3>we would shut that fucking thing down so quick.</v>

4398
01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:10.500
<v Speaker 3>There would be armed fucking men outside with tanks and jet's ready to drop</v>

4399
01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:10.861
<v Speaker 3>bombs.</v>

4400
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

4401
01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.780
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is in the box?</v>

4402
01:58:12.781 --> 01:58:13.614
<v Speaker 3>You freaks.</v>

4403
01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:15.840

4405
01:58:16.650 --> 01:58:19.430
<v Speaker 3>you're dressing like you dressed a thousand years ago and you're touching the</v>

4406
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.010
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

4407
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Is this fucking thing going to take you back to a thousand years ago?</v>

4408
01:58:22.321 --> 01:58:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Tell me why you dressed like a prey to it.</v>

4409
01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Don't forget that they bow to it constantly and they always know where it is.</v>

4410
01:58:28.111 --> 01:58:28.321
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4411
01:58:28.321 --> 01:58:29.154
<v Speaker 3>And they touch it,</v>

4412
01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:29.731
<v Speaker 3>they move around,</v>

4413
01:58:29.731 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 3>they want to touch it and people like pile through and eventually get to the</v>

4414
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:33.120
<v Speaker 3>center and touch it.</v>

4415
01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.210
<v Speaker 3>They're all touching it,</v>

4416
01:58:34.211 --> 01:58:36.150
<v Speaker 3>a whole around it and around the people touching it.</v>

4417
01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of people.</v>

4418
01:58:39.751 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands.</v>

4419
01:58:40.891 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many thousands just moving around in a circle milling around</v>

4420
01:58:43.871 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 3>this thing.</v>

4421
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:45.303
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

4422
01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:46.181
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

4423
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4424
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy to go to it,</v>

4425
01:58:48.071 --> 01:58:48.191
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4426
01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see which is fascinating that how,</v>

4427
01:58:50.441 --> 01:58:51.580
<v Speaker 3>this is what I wanted to bring up.</v>

4428
01:58:51.581 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that happen?</v>

4429
01:58:52.811 --> 01:58:53.890
<v Speaker 3>How does a meme,</v>

4430
01:58:53.891 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>how does an idea become so powerful that all of these people,</v>

4431
01:58:57.641 --> 01:58:59.680
<v Speaker 3>like a billion of them all over the world?</v>

4432
01:58:59.681 --> 01:58:59.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4433
01:58:59.861 --> 01:59:00.850
<v Speaker 3>what is the numbers of Islam?</v>

4434
01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:01.331
<v Speaker 3>Is it a billion?</v>

4435
01:59:01.331 --> 01:59:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Something like that?</v>

4436
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:02.321
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

4437
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:02.921
<v Speaker 3>Probably at least,</v>

4438
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:03.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4439
01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4440
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

4441
01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:04.820
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

4442
01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:05.531
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's not,</v>

4443
01:59:05.531 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

4444
01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 3>giant numbers of humans all around the world all follow this one pattern and</v>

4445
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 3>they really do all want to make this pilgrimage to Mecca and they really do say</v>

4446
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:18.850
<v Speaker 3>it's an incredible spiritual awakening like the symbolizes so much to them that</v>

4447
01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:22.360
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a placebo effect going there and being in the presence of this</v>

4448
01:59:22.361 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 3>thing and touching it and being around all these people that are like,</v>

4449
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:25.031
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4450
01:59:25.031 --> 01:59:25.864
<v Speaker 3>I'm at Mecca,</v>

4451
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:26.680
<v Speaker 3>we're at Meca today.</v>

4452
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:30.400
<v Speaker 3>And it forces everyone to be wholly forces everyone to try to like follow the</v>

4453
01:59:30.401 --> 01:59:33.090
<v Speaker 3>tenants of this religion and really believe in the love that this,</v>

4454
01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:34.690
<v Speaker 3>this group brings everybody together.</v>

4455
01:59:34.691 --> 01:59:35.524
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

4456
01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:37.900
<v Speaker 3>their religion is so much more power than it full than anybody else's.</v>

4457
01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else is willing to make that sort of commitment.</v>

4458
01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.570
<v Speaker 3>So because of this intense bond,</v>

4459
01:59:41.571 --> 01:59:42.940
<v Speaker 3>this intense commitment they have,</v>

4460
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:44.900
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that makes them the most dangerous job.</v>

4461
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:46.420
<v Speaker 3>They pray three times a day.</v>

4462
01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:47.171
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4463
01:59:47.171 --> 01:59:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many times I pray whatever happened to that kid that everyone</v>

4464
01:59:49.661 --> 01:59:50.860
<v Speaker 3>thought was like this born again.</v>

4465
01:59:50.861 --> 01:59:51.251
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

4466
01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:53.020
<v Speaker 3>they just like lived next to a tree,</v>

4467
01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:53.501
<v Speaker 3>remember?</v>

4468
01:59:53.501 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

4469
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:59.250
<v Speaker 3>he would just sit there quiet quietly for days and night eat and everyone was</v>

4470
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:01.130
<v Speaker 3>living in a tree that was in India.</v>

4471
02:00:01.131 --> 02:00:01.421
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>

4472
02:00:01.421 --> 02:00:01.661
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4473
02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I remember having a kid is in the United Indian,</v>

4474
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where,</v>

4475
02:00:04.271 --> 02:00:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it was India.</v>

4476
02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:05.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4477
02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for sure,</v>

4478
02:00:06.401 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but I remember that I was crazy.</v>

4479
02:00:07.781 --> 02:00:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And then he went up into the woods,</v>

4480
02:00:08.921 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 3>he's getting all this attention and he said he needed to go where it's quieter</v>

4481
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 3>because he was trying to like do some intense thing and he was even,</v>

4482
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:16.090
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

4483
02:00:16.090 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact words he said,</v>

4484
02:00:17.561 --> 02:00:18.394
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>

4485
02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.420
<v Speaker 3>I am not Buddha,</v>

4486
02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:20.610
<v Speaker 3>but I am the uh,</v>

4487
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.050
<v Speaker 3>some sort of incarnation of the something,</v>

4488
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:23.501
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

4489
02:00:23.501 --> 02:00:24.560
<v Speaker 3>It was really weird,</v>

4490
02:00:24.610 --> 02:00:25.330
<v Speaker 3>creepy.</v>

4491
02:00:25.330 --> 02:00:26.560
<v Speaker 3>And then he just kind of disappeared.</v>

4492
02:00:26.561 --> 02:00:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was just crazy kid in India.</v>

4493
02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's just over there eating mushrooms,</v>

4494
02:00:30.971 --> 02:00:31.810
<v Speaker 3>talking shit,</v>

4495
02:00:31.811 --> 02:00:32.770
<v Speaker 3>living in the woods.</v>

4496
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 3>And then when people come around to interview and he just touched,</v>

4497
02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:36.191
<v Speaker 3>he's so high,</v>

4498
02:00:36.191 --> 02:00:37.024
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even know what he's saying.</v>

4499
02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.533
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about.</v>

4500
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 3>He's the incarnation of the Buddha.</v>

4501
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 3>And the [inaudible] sent me some shit.</v>

4502
02:00:43.150 --> 02:00:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Awesome fucking professor in college and he got me,</v>

4503
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:49.180
<v Speaker 3>he basically talked me into going to India.</v>

4504
02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I went to India for several weeks because of him.</v>

4505
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4506
02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Cause I took a course called introduction to Southeast Asia of it.</v>

4507
02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:55.691
<v Speaker 3>He said in India,</v>

4508
02:00:55.691 --> 02:00:57.460
<v Speaker 3>what happens is hundred,</v>

4509
02:00:57.461 --> 02:00:58.211
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago,</v>

4510
02:00:58.211 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 3>a holy man,</v>

4511
02:00:59.930 --> 02:01:00.520
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

4512
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:01.660
<v Speaker 3>someone considers a guru,</v>

4513
02:01:01.661 --> 02:01:06.100
<v Speaker 3>drops the glove or does some little thing or eats and Mellon next to some</v>

4514
02:01:06.101 --> 02:01:07.360
<v Speaker 3>certain place and throws it down.</v>

4515
02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:07.801
<v Speaker 3>And then it's followed.</v>

4516
02:01:07.801 --> 02:01:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Followers were like,</v>

4517
02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:08.411
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4518
02:01:08.411 --> 02:01:09.244
<v Speaker 3>let's uh,</v>

4519
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:10.203
<v Speaker 3>let's uh,</v>

4520
02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:12.850
<v Speaker 3>enshrine this place where the seed from the Mellon,</v>

4521
02:01:12.851 --> 02:01:13.720
<v Speaker 3>our master rate is.</v>

4522
02:01:13.721 --> 02:01:16.210
<v Speaker 3>And then at temple eventually springs up around that.</v>

4523
02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 3>And so they've got NDAs just scattered with like shrines and temples and all</v>

4524
02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:24.520
<v Speaker 3>these bizarre like constructs that come from,</v>

4525
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4526
02:01:24.881 --> 02:01:29.881
<v Speaker 3>very specific events in the Zyl because Hinduism isn't just like one religion,</v>

4527
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.113
<v Speaker 3>one religion.</v>

4528
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a fragmentation of all these different ideas.</v>

4529
02:01:34.301 --> 02:01:37.180
<v Speaker 3>People who worship Braum and people who worship Vishnu,</v>

4530
02:01:37.181 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 3>people who worship Shiva,</v>

4531
02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 3>people who worship Demigodz David,</v>

4532
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:41.780
<v Speaker 3>it's all kinds of shit.</v>

4533
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It's not one thing.</v>

4534
02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fragmentation of a,</v>

4535
02:01:44.901 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 3>of something.</v>

4536
02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 3>They make the coolest art dude.</v>

4537
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4538
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:47.990
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

4539
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking Shiva.</v>

4540
02:01:49.101 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Like the Shiva that is,</v>

4541
02:01:50.290 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4542
02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:54.290
<v Speaker 3>someone explained to me that this is supposed to be the god of cannabis,</v>

4543
02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:57.110
<v Speaker 3>that this is supposed to be the got to cannabis and see that little thing that</v>

4544
02:01:57.111 --> 02:01:58.370
<v Speaker 3>he's standing on the bottom.</v>

4545
02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4546
02:01:58.670 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 3>That's supposed to be ignorance.</v>

4547
02:02:01.150 --> 02:02:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

4548
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4549
02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why he's got a sack that he carries.</v>

4550
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:04.600
<v Speaker 3>That's his wheat.</v>

4551
02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It's wheat and this is all represents fire and he's standing over ignorance.</v>

4552
02:02:08.670 --> 02:02:10.370
<v Speaker 3>You would think the backer dollar bill,</v>

4553
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you would think ignorance would be way bigger.</v>

4554
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a little baby ignorance,</v>

4555
02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I should say.</v>

4556
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Very optimistic.</v>

4557
02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:17.391
<v Speaker 3>Speaking ignorance.</v>

4558
02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:18.051
<v Speaker 3>Can I show you this?</v>

4559
02:02:18.051 --> 02:02:18.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4560
02:02:18.191 --> 02:02:18.561

<v Speaker 8>Make new retards.</v>

4628
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:37.410
<v Speaker 8>This is all what we're talking about,</v>

4629
02:04:37.411 --> 02:04:37.651
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

4630
02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:38.910
<v Speaker 8>This should happen to the Greeks,</v>

4631
02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:40.440
<v Speaker 8>to the Romans.</v>

4632
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:41.490
<v Speaker 8>It happened to everybody.</v>

4633
02:04:42.630 --> 02:04:47.040
<v Speaker 8>Eventually the fucking tribe gets watered down to the point where there's so</v>

4634
02:04:47.041 --> 02:04:50.130
<v Speaker 8>many of these fuckheads that people want to pay attention to them and even want</v>

4635
02:04:50.131 --> 02:04:51.930
<v Speaker 8>to elect one of their own to be the king of the world.</v>

4636
02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:54.080
<v Speaker 3>You know people like that.</v>

4641
02:04:56.751 --> 02:04:58.400
<v Speaker 3>You had a thousand people for your fucking show.</v>

4642
02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.510
<v Speaker 3>It's been a long time.</v>

4643
02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>

4644

4647
02:05:05.901 --> 02:05:07.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have to write good comedy.</v>

4648
02:05:07.210 --> 02:05:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Just throws him Jesus in there and hall and say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>

4653
02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Even like Terence Mckenna and his lectures,</v>

4654
02:05:14.781 --> 02:05:15.750
<v Speaker 3>he could throw a lob,</v>

4655
02:05:15.751 --> 02:05:16.790
<v Speaker 3>some softballs</v>

4656
02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:21.350
<v Speaker 3>or Deepak Chopra or anytime you listen to any of those guys,</v>

4657
02:05:23.050 --> 02:05:26.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a dummy not to see the game.</v>

4658
02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:28.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you're all crazy,</v>

4659
02:05:28.131 --> 02:05:28.881
<v Speaker 3>that's America.</v>

4660
02:05:28.881 --> 02:05:29.601
<v Speaker 3>That's America,</v>

4661
02:05:29.601 --> 02:05:30.770
<v Speaker 3>raw rock gods,</v>

4662
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:31.730
<v Speaker 3>gun government.</v>

4663
02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:33.080
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with God.</v>

4664
02:05:33.081 --> 02:05:34.970
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with government and there's nothing wrong with having</v>

4665
02:05:34.971 --> 02:05:35.301
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

4666
02:05:35.301 --> 02:05:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but you get all three of them together and they creates this weird fucking</v>

4667
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.380
<v Speaker 3>hybrid mentality.</v>

4668
02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:41.150
<v Speaker 3>That's America.</v>

4669
02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.380
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to think too much.</v>

4670
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:45.710
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to think about the fact you're getting fucked by gangsters.</v>

4671
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:47.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4672
02:05:47.331 --> 02:05:47.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4673
02:05:47.630 --> 02:05:48.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4674
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.621
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4675
02:05:48.621 --> 02:05:50.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's that sets the sappiness.</v>

4676
02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4677
02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:51.850
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

4678
02:05:51.850 --> 02:05:55.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not recognizing what the fuck is really going on when everybody's all God,</v>

4679
02:05:55.641 --> 02:05:56.451
<v Speaker 3>guns and government.</v>

4680
02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Like that's all well and good.</v>

4681
02:05:57.921 --> 02:06:01.940
<v Speaker 3>If there was a real bad guy and if it was a real situation where we didn't do</v>

4682
02:06:01.941 --> 02:06:02.774
<v Speaker 3>anything wrong,</v>

4683
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:04.010
<v Speaker 3>but when you're one,</v>

4684
02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:06.560
<v Speaker 3>the countries run by fucking gangsters,</v>

4685
02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>when you just assume some gangster shit is going down.</v>

4686
02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney was the fucking CEO of Halliburton before he gets into office,</v>

4687
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:15.590
<v Speaker 3>gets into office is basically one and Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4689
02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:21.220
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden how Britain gets billion dollars of no bid contracts to fix</v>

4690
02:06:21.621 --> 02:06:26.621

4691
02:06:26.721 --> 02:06:27.170
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

02:06:27.170 --> 02:06:30.140
<v Speaker 3>He has Halliburton stock and if that's black gangster,</v>

4693
02:06:30.141 --> 02:06:32.120
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is nobody does anything.</v>

4694
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:32.681
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>

4695
02:06:32.681 --> 02:06:36.230
<v Speaker 3>We say in my act he shot his friend and his face and his friend apologize.</v>

4696
02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:38.050
<v Speaker 3>That's as gangster as you get.</v>

4697
02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:39.290
<v Speaker 3>That's gangster shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's an Al Capone Shit.</v>

4699
02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:43.790
<v Speaker 3>These fucking people started a war and made money off it and everyone's like,</v>

4700
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:46.143
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4701
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:47.690
<v Speaker 3>think about the idea of it.</v>

4702
02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:49.070
<v Speaker 3>We got a problem.</v>

4703
02:06:49.190 --> 02:06:49.701
<v Speaker 3>We're going to just,</v>

4704
02:06:49.701 --> 02:06:49.851
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>

4705
02:06:49.851 --> 02:06:51.530
<v Speaker 3>if you know if Halliburton,</v>

4706
02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:52.100
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4707
02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>there's something like $90 billion that's missing.</v>

4708
02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:56.870
<v Speaker 3>You know there's like some insane amount of money that's missing.</v>

4709
02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I think about of Halliburton was a one person.</v>

4710
02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>It was one person and they stole $90 billion.</v>

4711
02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:05.690
<v Speaker 3>You can't just do that to be like where's the fucking money?</v>

4712
02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.760
<v Speaker 3>But because it's a gigantic corporation it's like,</v>

4713
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh what happened?</v>

4714
02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:09.920
<v Speaker 3>There's paperwork and who knows?</v>

4715
02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:11.270
<v Speaker 3>We're going to see if we can find it.</v>

4716
02:07:11.271 --> 02:07:12.290
<v Speaker 3>It's probably around here somewhere.</v>

4717
02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

4718
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:16.670
<v Speaker 3>that's some fucking straight gangster show.</v>

4719
02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Like what I like is like,</v>

4720
02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>cause we can talk about it like this and nothing's probably gonna happen to us.</v>

4721
02:07:21.741 --> 02:07:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's going to get ICO will be okay.</v>

4722
02:07:23.991 --> 02:07:27.560
<v Speaker 3>But I like watching when someone in Russia who she's no here,</v>

4723
02:07:27.561 --> 02:07:31.370
<v Speaker 3>when someone pokes the dragon and not wearing tries to snap like that Wiki leaks</v>

4724
02:07:31.371 --> 02:07:32.204
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

4725
02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:32.991
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4726
02:07:32.991 --> 02:07:34.790
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try to put that rape charge on him.</v>

4727
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:35.833
<v Speaker 3>Rape charge</v>

4728
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.910
<v Speaker 5>and you watch him.</v>

4729
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.870
<v Speaker 5>He went,</v>

4730
02:07:37.871 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 5>cause I saw this awesome lecture with him as he was just starting to to do it.</v>

4731
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 5>And you got all this life and I'm and this energy and he's like seemed like a</v>

4732
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:44.741
<v Speaker 5>hero.</v>

4733
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:46.540
<v Speaker 5>And then you cut to like four months later.</v>

4734
02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:47.650
<v Speaker 5>He looks like a ghost.</v>

4735
02:07:47.651 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 5>He's tired.</v>

4736
02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 5>He's like beat down because they're just applying the CIA pressure.</v>

4737
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:56.710
<v Speaker 5>He can't be with a girl if he meets a girl in the back of his head.</v>

4738
02:07:56.711 --> 02:08:01.420
<v Speaker 5>He's got to think it's this girl really liked me or is this an operative who got</v>

4739
02:08:01.421 --> 02:08:03.440
<v Speaker 5>sent in to shit too?</v>

4740
02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 5>That's really cool.</v>

4741
02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:04.840
<v Speaker 5>They did it.</v>

4742
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.470
<v Speaker 5>A rape charge on that guy that happened to coincide with him releasing the</v>

4743
02:08:08.471 --> 02:08:10.840
<v Speaker 5>biggest military leak and the United States history.</v>

4744
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.120
<v Speaker 5>They're so transparent.</v>

4745
02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 5>That's like the most transparent should ever,</v>

4746
02:08:14.651 --> 02:08:15.550
<v Speaker 5>unless he's really raped.</v>

4747
02:08:15.551 --> 02:08:16.300
<v Speaker 5>Somebody was like,</v>

4748
02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:17.133
<v Speaker 5>nobody believed me.</v>

4749
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have such a good guy.</v>

4750
02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:19.780
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4751
02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:20.071
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

4752
02:08:20.071 --> 02:08:20.531
<v Speaker 5>I caught,</v>

4753
02:08:20.531 --> 02:08:20.771
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4754
02:08:20.771 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

4755
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:22.750
<v Speaker 5>really fuck knows.</v>

4756
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:23.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the guy,</v>

4757
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.800
<v Speaker 5>but also they'd be weird if he was like a really good guy in some ways.</v>

4758
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:27.940
<v Speaker 5>What a Douche bag in other ways.</v>

4759
02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Well I,</v>

4760
02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:30.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's a possibility.</v>

4761
02:08:30.341 --> 02:08:30.911
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him.</v>

4762
02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:31.744
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem.</v>

4763
02:08:32.410 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 5>I think that the,</v>

4764
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:37.240
<v Speaker 5>there's a better chance that they're trying to frame it much better to send a</v>

4765
02:08:37.241 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 5>pdf out that was encrypted or something,</v>

4766
02:08:39.581 --> 02:08:40.300
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

4767
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:43.630
<v Speaker 5>And if he vanishes or something weird atmosphere and then he's sending the</v>

4768
02:08:43.631 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 5>password out that I don't think it would change much.</v>

4769
02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:46.841
<v Speaker 5>I think people would go,</v>

4770
02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:47.081
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4771
02:08:47.081 --> 02:08:47.914
<v Speaker 5>somebody killed him.</v>

4772
02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:50.480
<v Speaker 5>Oh well what's Paula Abdul doing that crazy bitch.</v>

4773
02:08:50.481 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 5>She's driving drunk again.</v>

4774
02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

4775
02:08:52.330 --> 02:08:53.960
<v Speaker 5>People would find some abstraction.</v>

4776
02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.660
<v Speaker 5>We don't do anything.</v>

4777
02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 5>We don't do anything.</v>

4778
02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.060
<v Speaker 5>That's what's so fucking weird about our [inaudible].</v>

4779
02:08:59.330 --> 02:09:03.790
<v Speaker 5>We are going to do everything or anything is if we change and the only way we</v>

4780
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:07.000
<v Speaker 5>are going to change as if the introduction of new ideas gets to the people at</v>

4781
02:09:07.001 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 5>the top.</v>

4782
02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.540
<v Speaker 5>If the people at the very top of the food chain that are doing the most fucked</v>

4783
02:09:10.541 --> 02:09:13.450
<v Speaker 5>up things in the world and we got to get them to have a look at this,</v>

4784
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:15.250
<v Speaker 5>we've got to get them to realize you're fucking,</v>

4785
02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:19.600
<v Speaker 5>you're creating this gigantic volcano of shit energy and it's not necessarily,</v>

4786
02:09:19.601 --> 02:09:20.680
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to do it this way.</v>

4787
02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 5>Everybody could figure out some way to make this thing work a lot better.</v>

4788
02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Just take this shit down.</v>

4789
02:09:26.081 --> 02:09:27.010
<v Speaker 5>We're going to turn the lights out.</v>

4790
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:27.820

<v Speaker 5>I can't fucking remember now.</v>

4818
02:10:08.110 --> 02:10:08.861
<v Speaker 5>He's an interesting dude.</v>

4819
02:10:08.861 --> 02:10:10.090
<v Speaker 5>He's got one of those greenhouses.</v>

4839
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.940
<v Speaker 3>about politicians should have to take LSD.</v>

4840
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:40.180
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that he definitely knew that she was going to do that and he</v>

4841
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.420

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4844
02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.251
<v Speaker 3>oh really?</v>

4845
02:10:46.251 --> 02:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

4846
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.391
<v Speaker 3>Look it up.</v>

4847
02:10:47.391 --> 02:10:47.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4848
02:10:47.601 --> 02:10:48.411
<v Speaker 3>you can look it up right now.</v>

4849
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:49.221
<v Speaker 3>It's on youtube.</v>

4850
02:10:49.221 --> 02:10:50.054
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4851
02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.250
<v Speaker 3>what does the name Larry Hagman Ebay.</v>

4852
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.811
<v Speaker 3>Our interviews.</v>

4853
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Larry Hagman LSD is like taking over man.</v>

4854
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:58.130
<v Speaker 3>She's doing all this crazy items.</v>

4855
02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:58.851
<v Speaker 3>Did you see her?</v>

4856
02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:02.300
<v Speaker 3>She walked off the set because they had bill O'Reilly on the bill.</v>

4857
02:11:02.301 --> 02:11:03.620
<v Speaker 3>O'Reilly was talking nonsense.</v>

4858
02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:04.820
<v Speaker 3>So she walked off the set.</v>

4859
02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

4860
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

4861
02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:07.551
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it,</v>

4862
02:11:07.551 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 3>but I heard about that.</v>

4863
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:09.793
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty interesting.</v>

4864
02:11:09.810 --> 02:11:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Was that with Whoopi Goldberg?</v>

4865
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:11.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4866
02:11:11.541 --> 02:11:12.380
<v Speaker 3>They both walked off.</v>

4867
02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:14.060
<v Speaker 3>They staged a protest.</v>

4868
02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:14.841
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4869
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:15.381
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

4870
02:11:15.381 --> 02:11:16.490
<v Speaker 3>We've had enough.</v>

4871
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't know what he was going to say.</v>

4872
02:11:18.051 --> 02:11:19.970
<v Speaker 3>They'd been planning that thing for days.</v>

4873
02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:20.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they didn't know?</v>

4874
02:11:20.871 --> 02:11:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4875
02:11:21.170 --> 02:11:22.700
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're just too busy to pay attention.</v>

4876
02:11:22.701 --> 02:11:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's so much shit going on.</v>

4877
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the time.</v>

4878
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:26.350
<v Speaker 3>We'll probably both on an arrow.</v>

4879
02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Riley's going to get on there and say it sounds in concern.</v>

4880
02:11:28.931 --> 02:11:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4881
02:11:29.210 --> 02:11:29.361
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4882
02:11:29.361 --> 02:11:32.720
<v Speaker 6>He was lobbing some softballs at George Bush was watching them interview George</v>

4883
02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:33.800
<v Speaker 6>Bush and one of the things that he said,</v>

4884
02:11:33.801 --> 02:11:33.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4885
02:11:33.921 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 6>I had Barney frank on and I called them all,</v>

4886
02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:37.190
<v Speaker 6>I'll a liar and a coward</v>

4887
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:41.630
<v Speaker 3>like he's bragging to George Bush that he called Barney Frank.</v>

4888
02:11:41.631 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 3>A Liar and a coward.</v>

4889
02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4890
02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:44.211
<v Speaker 3>Bushes.</v>

4891
02:11:44.211 --> 02:11:44.391
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4892
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:44.661
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4893
02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you really showed them I killed a million Iraqis.</v>

4894
02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4895
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:49.820
<v Speaker 3>million bitch.</v>

4896
02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I publicly admitted to a war crime and no one's going to do</v>

4897
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:56.530
<v Speaker 3>when they're in the uncommercial.</v>

4898
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:57.520
<v Speaker 3>He just leans over</v>

4899
02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:57.701
<v Speaker 11>bill.</v>

4900
02:11:57.701 --> 02:11:58.051
<v Speaker 11>Bill Buck.</v>

4901
02:11:58.051 --> 02:11:58.884
<v Speaker 11>Marsha,</v>

4902
02:11:59.290 --> 02:12:01.060
<v Speaker 11>I killed a million motherfuckers.</v>

4903
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:02.530
<v Speaker 11>I don't want to hear your Faggot,</v>

4904
02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:04.031
<v Speaker 11>faggot.</v>

4905
02:12:04.031 --> 02:12:07.600
<v Speaker 11>Talk about you told about gay congressmen that he's a coward.</v>

4906
02:12:07.601 --> 02:12:08.411
<v Speaker 11>Shut the fuck up.</v>

4907
02:12:08.411 --> 02:12:11.830
<v Speaker 11>You big giant bitch at big seven foot tall bitch.</v>

4908
02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:13.130
<v Speaker 11>I made reverse around with</v>

4909
02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:16.121
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

4910
02:12:16.121 --> 02:12:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Really think okay.</v>

4911
02:12:16.810 --> 02:12:17.111
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4912
02:12:17.111 --> 02:12:17.710
<v Speaker 3>You're a good guy.</v>

4913
02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:18.011
<v Speaker 3>You're good.</v>

4914
02:12:18.011 --> 02:12:18.844
<v Speaker 3>Yeah you're a good guy.</v>

4915
02:12:19.330 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Cause imma grab above the knee grab that are very sexual almost as long as they</v>

4916
02:12:23.961 --> 02:12:25.780
<v Speaker 3>ought to go too high they can get away with it.</v>

4917
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>But basically this is sexual triggers above your knee.</v>

4918
02:12:28.810 --> 02:12:30.640
<v Speaker 3>You know a men will grab your fucking knee.</v>

4919
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>That's like you're,</v>

4920
02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:31.991
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

4921
02:12:31.991 --> 02:12:33.730
<v Speaker 3>you're close to pulling my dick out right there.</v>

4922
02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:37.440
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing up at George Bush is a knee grabbing motherfucker.</v>

4923
02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows how to intimidate the shit out of him that he grabs me.</v>

4924
02:12:39.791 --> 02:12:41.640
<v Speaker 3>He's like we'll have you up at the groves.</v>

4925
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:43.091
<v Speaker 3>Bohemian Grove.</v>

4926
02:12:43.091 --> 02:12:44.470
<v Speaker 3>You think holy Shit.</v>

4927
02:12:44.471 --> 02:12:45.490
<v Speaker 3>You think it's real man.</v>

4928
02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:47.260
<v Speaker 3>You'll see modeling</v>

4929
02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:49.921
<v Speaker 11>crop circles,</v>

4930
02:12:49.921 --> 02:12:50.754
<v Speaker 11>Bro.</v>

4931
02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.170
<v Speaker 11>Crop circles.</v>

4932
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:56.430
<v Speaker 3>That was so disappointing when they like came out and showed how easy it was to</v>

4933
02:12:56.431 --> 02:12:57.460
<v Speaker 3>make those things what</v>

4934
02:12:57.460 --> 02:13:00.400
<v Speaker 6>they did and really they did in a lot of the designs,</v>

4935
02:13:00.401 --> 02:13:02.560
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of zines that are very questionable.</v>

4936
02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:06.220
<v Speaker 6>I would like to see how they did it because some of them are incredibly complex</v>

4937
02:13:06.221 --> 02:13:06.371
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

4938
02:13:06.371 --> 02:13:07.660
<v Speaker 6>Fractals there,</v>

4939
02:13:07.690 --> 02:13:10.870
<v Speaker 6>they're amazingly precise and they're huge and they appear so quickly.</v>

4940
02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not inclined to believe that all of them they're done by the same people.</v>

4941
02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.320
<v Speaker 6>I think it's very possible that some of them had done is by some new crazy</v>

4942
02:13:17.321 --> 02:13:20.010
<v Speaker 6>technology that we have maybe in satellite form.</v>

4943
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:21.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean think about a lot of them,</v>

4944
02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:24.070
<v Speaker 6>you know appeared in the past but they weren't not intricate.</v>

4945
02:13:24.071 --> 02:13:24.491
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a,</v>

4946
02:13:24.491 --> 02:13:28.930
<v Speaker 6>this is a thing about them from like the 16 hundreds I believe it might've even</v>

4947
02:13:28.931 --> 02:13:30.640
<v Speaker 6>been slightly earlier than that,</v>

4948
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:34.140
<v Speaker 6>but a drawing of a devil do it with a sickle,</v>

4949
02:13:34.141 --> 02:13:36.480
<v Speaker 6>making a crop circle and a lot of the crop circle people,</v>

4950
02:13:36.481 --> 02:13:38.130
<v Speaker 6>they look at that as evidence,</v>

4951
02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 6>but there was never anything like they see today.</v>

4952
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Like there are far more complex like the Mandelbaum Nemanda brought set the</v>

4953
02:13:45.361 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 6>fractal,</v>

4954
02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:46.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4955
02:13:46.321 --> 02:13:48.060
<v Speaker 6>there's like this infinite beautiful fractal.</v>

4956
02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:51.600
<v Speaker 6>When they figured it out mathematically on a computer within like weeks,</v>

4957
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.820
<v Speaker 6>someone had drawn it in a crop circle.</v>

4958
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

4959
02:13:54.690 --> 02:13:55.501
<v Speaker 6>to me it's like,</v>

4960
02:13:55.501 --> 02:13:55.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4961
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 6>there's an,</v>

4962
02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:56.230
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4963
02:13:56.230 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 6>it's either alien saying,</v>

4964
02:13:57.630 --> 02:13:58.291
<v Speaker 6>oh you get it,</v>

4965
02:13:58.291 --> 02:14:00.900
<v Speaker 6>or it's some fucking really funny,</v>

4966
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4967
02:14:01.291 --> 02:14:06.291
<v Speaker 6>government scientists with this crazy ability to transform matter or plants on</v>

4968
02:14:07.081 --> 02:14:08.460
<v Speaker 6>the ground with this laser beam,</v>

4969
02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.320
<v Speaker 6>they can make a design in the wheat.</v>

4970
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's much more likely that it's some sort of a weapon or not even a</v>

4971
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:13.741
<v Speaker 6>weapon.</v>

4972
02:14:13.741 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe it was something that was developed as they were developing weapons and</v>

4973
02:14:17.071 --> 02:14:17.460
<v Speaker 6>then you,</v>

4974
02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:18.570
<v Speaker 6>they realize that you could make,</v>

4975
02:14:18.571 --> 02:14:20.550
<v Speaker 6>it was such a powerful pulsating move.</v>

4976
02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:20.851
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4977
02:14:20.851 --> 02:14:23.850
<v Speaker 6>there's this beam that you can make designs in the grass with it.</v>

4978
02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:24.001
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4979
02:14:24.001 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 6>it's very possible you think about all the shit that they have that we didn't</v>

4980
02:14:26.341 --> 02:14:27.590
<v Speaker 6>know about for the longest time.</v>

4981
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 6>Stealth bombers and shit.</v>

4982
02:14:28.831 --> 02:14:32.010
<v Speaker 6>And who knows what the fuck they're working on an area 51 they could have</v>

4983
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:35.700
<v Speaker 6>somebody at the top of the heap or it's a local college and then all the art</v>

4984
02:14:35.701 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 6>students at every year have to do like three of them per class.</v>

4985
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:40.530
<v Speaker 6>And it's like this big school secret.</v>

4986
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 6>Well those mother fuckers deserve some money.</v>

4987
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:43.890
<v Speaker 6>They should be coming out and bragging about it.</v>

4988
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:44.101
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4989
02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:45.300
<v Speaker 6>just the circle makers.</v>

4990
02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:45.860
<v Speaker 6>There's a guy,</v>

4991
02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:47.190
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of guys called the circle maker,</v>

4992
02:14:47.191 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] dot org and they,</v>

4993
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:49.650
<v Speaker 6>they've made a bunch of them and they've shown they're,</v>

4994
02:14:49.651 --> 02:14:50.191
<v Speaker 6>they're pretty good.</v>

4995
02:14:50.191 --> 02:14:50.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4996
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:51.000
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4997
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:51.960
<v Speaker 6>no doubt about it.</v>

4998
02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 6>But the ones that are there,</v>

4999
02:14:53.401 --> 02:14:55.110
<v Speaker 6>the other ones that people have now,</v>

5000
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.760
<v Speaker 6>this is all shit that I've read on the Internet and watching documentary,</v>

5001
02:14:57.770 --> 02:15:00.240
<v Speaker 6>so I'm not exactly sure if it's the same over.</v>

5002
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.080
<v Speaker 6>It's true rather,</v>

5003
02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.440
<v Speaker 6>but what the way they describe these stocks being bent,</v>

5004
02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:08.580
<v Speaker 6>it's like they have these growth nodes where it explodes like almost like it's</v>

5005
02:15:08.581 --> 02:15:09.420
<v Speaker 6>been microwaved,</v>

5006
02:15:09.630 --> 02:15:13.500
<v Speaker 6>like it expands out from heat and then blows up where it bends over and at these</v>

5007
02:15:13.501 --> 02:15:15.690
<v Speaker 6>exist all throughout these patterns and those patterns,</v>

5008
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:19.740
<v Speaker 6>they don't really exist like that during a just stomping them down with boards.</v>

5009
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.341
<v Speaker 6>So it may,</v>

5010
02:15:20.341 --> 02:15:22.890
<v Speaker 6>it may very well be that there's a bunch of different ways that people have done</v>

5011
02:15:22.891 --> 02:15:23.724
<v Speaker 6>these things.</v>

5012
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:27.150
<v Speaker 6>The one thing I thought when I was trying to believe in crop circles as well,</v>

5013
02:15:27.151 --> 02:15:31.530
<v Speaker 6>if there was a super intelligent thing sending signals through space,</v>

5014
02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.220
<v Speaker 6>then maybe they'd figured out that part of evolution is that whatever the</v>

5015
02:15:35.221 --> 02:15:38.790
<v Speaker 6>species was would learn to plant crops or something.</v>

5016
02:15:38.850 --> 02:15:42.420
<v Speaker 6>And so they're trying to communicate through the food stamp,</v>

5017
02:15:42.421 --> 02:15:43.260
<v Speaker 6>the food source.</v>

5018
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.580
<v Speaker 6>So that totally makes sense.</v>

5019
02:15:44.581 --> 02:15:44.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's,</v>

5020
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:46.230
<v Speaker 6>you're guaranteeing that people are gonna see it,</v>

5021
02:15:46.231 --> 02:15:48.930
<v Speaker 6>especially if they can't really see us.</v>

5022
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:53.130
<v Speaker 6>What if their vision and their need for vision is so entirely different than us,</v>

5023
02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:55.320
<v Speaker 6>that they literally can't see us,</v>

5024
02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.510
<v Speaker 6>but they know where plants are and they're,</v>

5025
02:15:57.511 --> 02:15:59.460
<v Speaker 6>they're like not even in this dimension.</v>

5026
02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 6>And they're communicating through some sort of a portal.</v>

5027
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:05.220
<v Speaker 6>And the way they can communicate through this portal is by implanting these</v>

5028
02:16:05.221 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 6>designs onto what they know is going to be food because they know that,</v>

5029
02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

5030
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:12.660
<v Speaker 6>we've received a certain signal from this area that indicates that it's plant</v>

5031
02:16:12.661 --> 02:16:13.940
<v Speaker 6>life and uh,</v>

5032
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:17.310
<v Speaker 6>it's grown in large areas that seem to be uniform,</v>

5033
02:16:17.311 --> 02:16:19.650
<v Speaker 6>which indicate that someone is growing it on purpose.</v>

5034
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.970
<v Speaker 6>So it must be their food.</v>

5035
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:23.160
<v Speaker 6>So let's just leave designs in this food.</v>

5036
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:24.510
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

5037
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:25.310
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

5038
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.951
<v Speaker 6>It could be,</v>

5039
02:16:25.951 --> 02:16:27.480
<v Speaker 6>but it also could be some fucking dude.</v>

5040
02:16:27.481 --> 02:16:28.314
<v Speaker 6>Your boards,</v>

5041
02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 6>some of them are amazing</v>

5042
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

5043
02:16:30.490 --> 02:16:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I believe that some of them could be,</v>

5044
02:16:32.610 --> 02:16:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but some of them are for sure.</v>

5045
02:16:33.521 --> 02:16:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's things like that though.</v>

5046
02:16:34.391 --> 02:16:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at any artists doing something and he didn't know an artist did</v>

5047
02:16:38.471 --> 02:16:38.651
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5048
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like if you go out in the middle of a pyramid and some artists worked on it,</v>

5049
02:16:42.101 --> 02:16:43.600
<v Speaker 1>you know overnight with you know,</v>

5050
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:45.050
<v Speaker 1>making this masterpiece and you,</v>

5051
02:16:45.051 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't think it would be like anyone had access to this pyramid and you</v>

5052
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:49.324
<v Speaker 1>just saw it,</v>

5053
02:16:49.390 --> 02:16:50.081
<v Speaker 1>you would probably think,</v>

5054
02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:50.321
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5055
02:16:50.321 --> 02:16:51.310
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck was this made,</v>

5056
02:16:51.311 --> 02:16:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5057
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.130
<v Speaker 1>To me I look at a lot of these things and to me it looks like,</v>

5058
02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>okay this is something like a bunch of people plan the shit out and they just</v>

5059
02:16:58.330 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

5060
02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like graffiti almost and there's towns that they're always found in there</v>

5061
02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:06.040
<v Speaker 1>like poor towns that their only income is people going to see these things.</v>

5062
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:06.911
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

5063
02:17:06.911 --> 02:17:07.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5064
02:17:07.091 --> 02:17:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Like in England,</v>

5065
02:17:07.811 --> 02:17:08.311
<v Speaker 1>the crop circle,</v>

5066
02:17:08.311 --> 02:17:09.071
<v Speaker 1>but it is a good point,</v>

5067
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5068
02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5069
02:17:09.710 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 1>If you set up like roadside signs and sell lemonade,</v>

5070
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you get a fucking minute,</v>

5071
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:14.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll clean it up.</v>

5072
02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:14.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5073
02:17:14.651 --> 02:17:15.371
<v Speaker 1>There's what that will mean.</v>

5074
02:17:15.371 --> 02:17:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That was an issue that I had about the whole Ufo experience too.</v>

5075
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5076
02:17:18.510 --> 02:17:18.621
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5077
02:17:18.621 --> 02:17:22.000
<v Speaker 1>the problem I have with believing you fos is that people are selling books and</v>

5078
02:17:22.001 --> 02:17:25.210
<v Speaker 1>people are making money and when you start making money and you're an author,</v>

5079
02:17:25.211 --> 02:17:26.440
<v Speaker 1>like I was making fun of,</v>

5080
02:17:26.441 --> 02:17:26.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5081
02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.840
<v Speaker 1>what's the guy's name that wrote communion?</v>

5082
02:17:28.841 --> 02:17:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Whitley Strieber.</v>

5083
02:17:29.610 --> 02:17:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5084
02:17:29.770 --> 02:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>He's like the premier guys.</v>

5085
02:17:30.841 --> 02:17:31.720
<v Speaker 1>He's been abducted by aliens.</v>

5086
02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Also happens to be a fucking brilliant fiction writer.</v>

5087
02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Wrote Wolfen you wrote that?</v>

5088
02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.180
<v Speaker 1>The Werewolf Movie Wolfen which has got one of the fucking coolest werewolf</v>

5089
02:17:40.181 --> 02:17:41.014
<v Speaker 1>movies ever.</v>

5090
02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:42.250
<v Speaker 1>They weren't really werewolf.</v>

5091
02:17:42.251 --> 02:17:46.360
<v Speaker 1>They were just super intelligent wolves and it was the fucking main star in that</v>

5092
02:17:46.361 --> 02:17:47.110
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

5093
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that.</v>

5094
02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn that movies are good.</v>

5095
02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying that shit on iTunes today.</v>

5096
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

5097
02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.153
<v Speaker 1>Too thin.</v>

5098
02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.280
<v Speaker 1>They better have that.</v>

5099
02:17:54.510 --> 02:17:55.241
<v Speaker 1>I bet they don't,</v>

5100
02:17:55.241 --> 02:17:55.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5101
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:55.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5102
02:17:55.781 --> 02:17:57.770
<v Speaker 1>iTunes is just getting the Beatles now,</v>

5103
02:17:58.330 --> 02:17:59.163
<v Speaker 1>finally.</v>

5104
02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 1>So all I remember that thing.</v>

5105
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:02.320
<v Speaker 1>What is the guy's name?</v>

5106
02:18:02.321 --> 02:18:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Who's the main star right around when the howling came out,</v>

5107
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:09.040
<v Speaker 1>didn't it think it was even a little bit Werewolf too?</v>

5108
02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:10.143
<v Speaker 1>That's my shit.</v>

5109
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.400
<v Speaker 1>That's another fucking subject we'd beat to death on this podcast.</v>

5110
02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Werewolves,</v>

5111
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:16.751
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

5112
02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Where?</v>

5113
02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:18.013
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

5114
02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:18.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5115
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:19.331
<v Speaker 1>they don't have it.</v>

5116
02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:19.691
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

5117
02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Not fucking clowns go.</v>

5118
02:18:22.121 --> 02:18:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Have you been checking Amazon lately?</v>

5119
02:18:23.471 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed every time I buy a CD now I just go to Amazon first because,</v>

5120
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:27.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5121
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like iTunes.</v>

5122
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:29.230
<v Speaker 1>There was something that the other day,</v>

5123
02:18:29.231 --> 02:18:29.981
<v Speaker 1>White Buffalo,</v>

5124
02:18:29.981 --> 02:18:31.990
<v Speaker 1>which is a local la guy that's really good.</v>

5125
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I went on a iTunes,</v>

5126
02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:35.920
<v Speaker 1>it was like 1299 then went on Amazon.</v>

5127
02:18:35.921 --> 02:18:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It was eight 99 and it was Albert Finney thing to,</v>

5128
02:18:39.430 --> 02:18:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5129
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:41.230
<v Speaker 1>this is DVD 2002.</v>

5130
02:18:41.231 --> 02:18:42.850
<v Speaker 1>That's not when the movie came out pitch.</v>

5131
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:46.720
<v Speaker 1>That's when the DVD was released to Wolfen Whitley Strieber paperback.</v>

5132
02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5133
02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:50.530
<v Speaker 1>They can you still buy a VHS and credible.</v>

5134
02:18:50.710 --> 02:18:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I wonder when the movie came out though.</v>

5135
02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I know the DVD came out in [inaudible] 81 bro.</v>

5136
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I was a freshman in high school.</v>

5137
02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:59.950
<v Speaker 1>This movie was the shit to day one click.</v>

5138
02:18:59.951 --> 02:19:00.784
<v Speaker 1>Please</v>

5139
02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:03.213
<v Speaker 1>give me that shit.</v>

5140
02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.110
<v Speaker 1>He seen the,</v>

5141
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:06.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5142
02:19:06.990 --> 02:19:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Amandil Bulb.</v>

5143
02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:13.200
<v Speaker 1>If you seen the three d projections I have of the Mandelbrot set fractal.</v>

5144
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:14.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5145
02:19:14.681 --> 02:19:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Fractals are insane.</v>

5146
02:19:15.761 --> 02:19:17.230
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind fractals is,</v>

5147
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:17.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

5148
02:19:17.921 --> 02:19:20.170
<v Speaker 1>that's really probably the fact of the universe.</v>

5149
02:19:20.171 --> 02:19:23.380
<v Speaker 1>The fabric of everything is that it is infinitely small and infinitely large and</v>

5150
02:19:23.381 --> 02:19:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it goes to no end.</v>

5151
02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.380
<v Speaker 1>That just keep going and going and going and it never stops.</v>

5152
02:19:27.381 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5153
02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>there's never</v>

5154
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 6>a smallest point ever.</v>

5155
02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:29.840
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5156
02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:31.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we could wrap our heads around that.</v>

5157
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:32.031
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5158
02:19:32.031 --> 02:19:32.601
<v Speaker 6>we think that,</v>

5159
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:32.801
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5160
02:19:32.801 --> 02:19:33.800
<v Speaker 6>there's should be,</v>

5161
02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:34.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5162
02:19:34.371 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

5163
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 6>everything gets smaller and smaller.</v>

5164
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:36.291
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5165
02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:38.120
<v Speaker 6>there has to be some infinite small point.</v>

5166
02:19:38.121 --> 02:19:38.450
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5167
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.661
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5168
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:39.020
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

5169
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:39.530
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>

5170
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:41.510
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like a line of code,</v>

5171
02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:44.620
<v Speaker 6>like just goes into another line like it is it,</v>

5172
02:19:44.621 --> 02:19:45.890
<v Speaker 6>that's how we are connected,</v>

5173
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 6>like dimension to dimension.</v>

5174
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:49.940
<v Speaker 6>It just gets infinitely small and then expands out again.</v>

5175
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:52.250
<v Speaker 6>That's intense.</v>

5176
02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:53.511
<v Speaker 6>You want to intense,</v>

5177
02:19:53.511 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 6>there's a big controversy right now because a Obama's book,</v>

5178
02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:59.010
<v Speaker 6>Obama has a kid's book and a,</v>

5179
02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:03.800
<v Speaker 6>in this kid's book he fucking talks about how great sitting bull is.</v>

5180
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.020
<v Speaker 6>Sitting bowl is.</v>

5181
02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:10.190
<v Speaker 6>He says a medicine man who healed broken hearts and broken promises.</v>

5182
02:20:10.430 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 6>It's a fine,</v>

5183
02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:13.580
<v Speaker 6>it is fine that we are different.</v>

5184
02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:14.871
<v Speaker 6>The book,</v>

5185
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:17.810
<v Speaker 6>who's royalties go to helping the children falling or disabled service members</v>

5186
02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:22.460
<v Speaker 6>also says that the Lakota chief spoke out and led his people against many</v>

5187
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:24.440
<v Speaker 6>policies of the United States government.</v>

5188
02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 6>He is most famous for his stunning victory in 1876 over lieutenant colonel</v>

5189
02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 6>George Armstrong cuts Custer in the battle of little big horn.</v>

5190
02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:34.310
<v Speaker 6>So basically he's got a fucking,</v>

5191
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:39.400
<v Speaker 6>he's the president of a nation and he's praising a guy taking a side on,</v>

5192
02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:39.830
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5193
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:40.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5194
02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:40.341
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5195
02:20:40.341 --> 02:20:40.430
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5196
02:20:40.430 --> 02:20:43.640
<v Speaker 6>native American that killed a bunch of American citizens.</v>

5197
02:20:43.970 --> 02:20:45.050
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that all about?</v>

5198
02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:46.250
<v Speaker 6>That's a weird choice.</v>

5199
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:49.010
<v Speaker 6>Cause I understand that you think that war is bad.</v>

5200
02:20:49.011 --> 02:20:51.650
<v Speaker 6>And I understand that you think that imperialism and everything that got us here</v>

5201
02:20:51.651 --> 02:20:53.180
<v Speaker 6>and created earth are created,</v>

5202
02:20:53.181 --> 02:20:53.410
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5203
02:20:53.410 --> 02:20:55.320
<v Speaker 6>the America rather earth it's been fulfilled,</v>

5204
02:20:55.321 --> 02:20:56.580
<v Speaker 6>was referring to this was raw.</v>

5205
02:20:56.810 --> 02:20:58.130
<v Speaker 6>I understand that you would think that that's,</v>

5206
02:20:58.131 --> 02:20:58.964
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5207
02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:00.890
<v Speaker 6>that it's a wrong thing that happened.</v>

5208
02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:01.850
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible that happened.</v>

5209
02:21:01.851 --> 02:21:04.700
<v Speaker 6>But you know what a weird choice to to,</v>

5210
02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:05.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5211
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:08.000
<v Speaker 6>obviously that we won and that's what happened.</v>

5212
02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:08.960
<v Speaker 6>And that's why people are here.</v>

5213
02:21:08.961 --> 02:21:09.860
<v Speaker 6>And that's where the cities,</v>

5214
02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:11.000
<v Speaker 6>so you're a part of this,</v>

5215
02:21:11.001 --> 02:21:11.570
<v Speaker 6>that one.</v>

5216
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:12.220
<v Speaker 6>So you're,</v>

5217
02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:15.110
<v Speaker 6>I guess what you're saying is we want in a terrible way,</v>

5218
02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.430
<v Speaker 6>and we took over the,</v>

5219
02:21:16.431 --> 02:21:20.690
<v Speaker 6>the Indians in a terrible way and thank goodness that they got some licks in and</v>

5220
02:21:20.691 --> 02:21:20.961
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>

5221
02:21:20.961 --> 02:21:22.610
<v Speaker 6>let's give him props and you know,</v>

5222
02:21:22.611 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 6>you gig does kicked our ass a little bit more and like bring them back into the</v>

5223
02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:26.631
<v Speaker 6>fold and say like,</v>

5224
02:21:26.631 --> 02:21:27.140
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5225
02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:31.160
<v Speaker 6>well this is a man that had a lot of value to his people and our people weren't</v>

5226
02:21:31.161 --> 02:21:31.931
<v Speaker 6>exactly fucked up,</v>

5227
02:21:31.931 --> 02:21:35.450
<v Speaker 6>but let's put bygones be bygones and let's talk about what a bad ass this dude</v>

5228
02:21:35.451 --> 02:21:35.631
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>

5229
02:21:35.631 --> 02:21:35.781
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5230
02:21:35.781 --> 02:21:38.660
<v Speaker 6>they had like bows and arrows and they were fresh new divorces.</v>

5231
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:39.320
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

5232
02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.940
<v Speaker 6>Like they only had horses flagging a hundred years or so and they,</v>

5233
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:44.000
<v Speaker 6>they kicked ass on custard with his guns.</v>

5234
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.271
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5235
02:21:44.271 --> 02:21:45.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean they had some guns back then too,</v>

5236
02:21:45.591 --> 02:21:46.221
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

5237
02:21:46.221 --> 02:21:46.421
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

5238
02:21:46.421 --> 02:21:48.680
<v Speaker 6>they fucking trapped the American citizens.</v>

5239
02:21:48.681 --> 02:21:50.810
<v Speaker 6>They fucking sucked him into a trap.</v>

5240
02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:51.790
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5241
02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:54.890
<v Speaker 6>I could see out like a black president would be dirty coal,</v>

5242
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:56.900
<v Speaker 6>but it's an interesting choice.</v>

5243
02:21:56.901 --> 02:21:57.734
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5244
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.910
<v Speaker 6>Well I get it though,</v>

5245
02:21:58.911 --> 02:21:59.361
<v Speaker 6>cause it's like,</v>

5246
02:21:59.361 --> 02:21:59.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5247
02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:03.130
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that long ago that the United States government was like with</v>

5248
02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:05.390
<v Speaker 6>enslaving his ancestors.</v>

5249
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:08.630
<v Speaker 6>So it totally makes sense that you'd idolize it,</v>

5250
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:09.650
<v Speaker 6>but they don't ever say that.</v>

5251
02:22:09.651 --> 02:22:10.250
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5252
02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:13.430
<v Speaker 6>Like he never comes out and fully expresses himself and he never comes out and</v>

5253
02:22:13.431 --> 02:22:13.641
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

5254
02:22:13.641 --> 02:22:15.470
<v Speaker 6>this is what's important to me about this.</v>

5255
02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:18.320
<v Speaker 6>I understand that this man killed American citizens.</v>

5256
02:22:18.321 --> 02:22:19.160
<v Speaker 6>And I understand that,</v>

5257
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.431
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5258
02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:21.260
<v Speaker 6>if it wasn't for battles like this,</v>

5259
02:22:21.261 --> 02:22:24.140
<v Speaker 6>we would still have problems with Indians attacking us and we could never have</v>

5260
02:22:24.141 --> 02:22:25.230
<v Speaker 6>the same life that we have now.</v>

5261
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:25.591
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5262
02:22:25.591 --> 02:22:28.080
<v Speaker 6>somebody had to pave the way supposedly to do this.</v>

5263
02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 6>I understand that he would say that,</v>

5264
02:22:29.701 --> 02:22:30.840
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to,</v>

5265
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:31.351
<v Speaker 6>you've got to,</v>

5266
02:22:31.351 --> 02:22:32.131
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

5267
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:32.640
<v Speaker 6>at least,</v>

5268
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.810
<v Speaker 6>you got to kind of explain where your head's at with all this just right.</v>

5269
02:22:35.890 --> 02:22:37.620
<v Speaker 6>You can't just show tweet and he's following you.</v>

5270
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.521
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5271
02:22:38.521 --> 02:22:39.510
<v Speaker 6>But you can't just say,</v>

5272
02:22:39.511 --> 02:22:40.590
<v Speaker 6>you know that he,</v>

5273
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:40.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5274
02:22:40.921 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 6>was a,</v>

5275
02:22:41.490 --> 02:22:45.900
<v Speaker 6>he's most famous for his stunning victory in 1876 which you got to say is we</v>

5276
02:22:45.901 --> 02:22:49.470
<v Speaker 6>have to get past all of this stuff and recognize that even though,</v>

5277
02:22:49.730 --> 02:22:50.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5278
02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:54.690
<v Speaker 6>America was evil or we did something that we shouldn't have done or you know,</v>

5279
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:55.010
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

5280
02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:57.020
<v Speaker 6>we took over their land and fuck them over and written.</v>

5281
02:22:57.021 --> 02:22:58.170
<v Speaker 6>Let's all let that shit go.</v>

5282
02:22:58.380 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

5283
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 6>What's not me?</v>

5284
02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:00.473
<v Speaker 6>And it's not you.</v>

5285
02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:01.650
<v Speaker 6>It's our ancestors.</v>

5286
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 6>We have learned from this and we are stronger because of this.</v>

5287
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:06.810
<v Speaker 6>But what people don't like to hear is the Lakota,</v>

5288
02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 6>you know that name Lakota.</v>

5289
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:09.930
<v Speaker 6>That's what they call themselves.</v>

5290
02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:10.141
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5291
02:23:10.141 --> 02:23:11.820
<v Speaker 6>you know what the Indians called them sue,</v>

5292
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:13.620
<v Speaker 6>because sue means enemy.</v>

5293
02:23:14.130 --> 02:23:16.740
<v Speaker 6>Cause the LAKOTAS would just run around Jack and folks.</v>

5294
02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:17.341
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

5295
02:23:17.341 --> 02:23:18.174
<v Speaker 6>That's what they did.</v>

5296
02:23:18.210 --> 02:23:19.710
<v Speaker 6>Indians did the same thing that we did.</v>

5297
02:23:19.711 --> 02:23:21.360
<v Speaker 6>They just did it on shitty smaller scale.</v>

5298
02:23:21.390 --> 02:23:22.320
<v Speaker 6>The Sun ritual,</v>

5299
02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:23.270
<v Speaker 6>you know the sandwich,</v>

5300
02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:23.821
<v Speaker 6>what's it called?</v>

5301
02:23:23.821 --> 02:23:24.361
<v Speaker 6>What's that car?</v>

5302
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:25.031
<v Speaker 6>There's not the Senate.</v>

5303
02:23:25.031 --> 02:23:25.561
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

5304
02:23:25.561 --> 02:23:28.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm like the fuck is that card they put hooks in your chest from,</v>

5305
02:23:28.780 --> 02:23:29.640
<v Speaker 6>was that movie?</v>

5306
02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:31.043
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5307
02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:32.370
<v Speaker 6>the fucking,</v>

5308
02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:33.600
<v Speaker 6>what's his name?</v>

5309
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.991
<v Speaker 6>God.</v>

5310
02:23:33.991 --> 02:23:34.680
<v Speaker 6>Sundance.</v>

5311
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 6>It's called the center.</v>

5312
02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:37.080
<v Speaker 6>Like the Sundance festival is named after.</v>

5313
02:23:37.081 --> 02:23:37.640
<v Speaker 6>It was cause it really?</v>

5314
02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:37.891
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5315
02:23:37.891 --> 02:23:39.300
<v Speaker 6>the Sundance and what it is is,</v>

5316
02:23:39.330 --> 02:23:40.820
<v Speaker 6>oh it was when you go,</v>

5317
02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:42.090
<v Speaker 6>oh man called horse.</v>

5318
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.391
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5319
02:23:42.391 --> 02:23:43.230
<v Speaker 6>man called horse.</v>

5320
02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:44.460
<v Speaker 6>And it was an initiative,</v>

5321
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:49.490
<v Speaker 6>initiatory phase where they were to hang themselves from trees or from something</v>

5322
02:23:49.501 --> 02:23:52.650
<v Speaker 6>with hooks through their chest and just hang there where their skin kind of</v>

5323
02:23:52.651 --> 02:23:53.484
<v Speaker 6>being pulled out.</v>

5324
02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:54.660
<v Speaker 6>What was the reason for that?</v>

5325
02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:57.180
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a initiation thing,</v>

5326
02:23:57.181 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>

5327
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:58.261
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea.</v>

5328
02:23:58.261 --> 02:23:59.440
<v Speaker 6>I assume it's like something,</v>

5329
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:00.450
<v Speaker 6>there's something to that.</v>

5330
02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:02.160
<v Speaker 6>I think there's something to initiations.</v>

5331
02:24:02.161 --> 02:24:04.680
<v Speaker 6>I think there's something to grand events like this hodge,</v>

5332
02:24:04.681 --> 02:24:06.210
<v Speaker 6>like the pilgrimage to Mecca.</v>

5333
02:24:06.211 --> 02:24:07.560
<v Speaker 6>I think there is something to that man.</v>

5334
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:10.170
<v Speaker 6>And I think that might be one of the reasons why people are fucked up cause we</v>

5335
02:24:10.171 --> 02:24:12.090
<v Speaker 6>don't have very clearly defined moments.</v>

5336
02:24:12.091 --> 02:24:13.170
<v Speaker 6>We have to get your shit together.</v>

5337
02:24:13.171 --> 02:24:14.040
<v Speaker 6>You are a man now.</v>

5338
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.760
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>

5339
02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:15.331
<v Speaker 6>Move on.</v>

5340
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:15.751
<v Speaker 6>Bam.</v>

5341
02:24:15.751 --> 02:24:15.931
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

5342
02:24:15.931 --> 02:24:17.040
<v Speaker 6>you know you hit the next stage.</v>

5343
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:20.360
<v Speaker 6>Let's acknowledge the fact all together that we are evolving together.</v>

5344
02:24:20.390 --> 02:24:21.720
<v Speaker 6>We have reached this new plateau.</v>

5345
02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:23.190
<v Speaker 6>Father have gone to the mountain,</v>

5346
02:24:23.191 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 6>you know you're going to do some shit.</v>

5347
02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:26.010
<v Speaker 6>Put your hands in the gloves,</v>

5348
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:28.350
<v Speaker 6>the hands and the gloves with the bullet ants and get fucked up.</v>

5349
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:29.040
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5350
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.450
<v Speaker 6>get past your pain figures.</v>

5351
02:24:31.170 --> 02:24:32.580
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what I said earlier man,</v>

5352
02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:33.720
<v Speaker 6>about the Greeks and the Romans.</v>

5353
02:24:33.721 --> 02:24:35.370
<v Speaker 6>I think people get soft as fuck.</v>

5354
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:36.663
<v Speaker 6>That's what's happening.</v>

5355
02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:38.280
<v Speaker 6>You dirty,</v>

5356
02:24:38.310 --> 02:24:39.390
<v Speaker 6>dirty bitches.</v>

5357
02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:40.291
<v Speaker 6>Richard Harris,</v>

5358
02:24:40.291 --> 02:24:41.160
<v Speaker 6>a man called horse.</v>

5359
02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:46.310
<v Speaker 6>Let me see while I one click that shit son Love Amazon one click for movies.</v>

5360
02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:49.470
<v Speaker 6>It's the most addictive thing of all time.</v>

5361
02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:53.370
<v Speaker 6>I had a professor who is really into the Lakota and I asked fascinating,</v>

5362
02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.810
<v Speaker 6>asked him if he'd have you ever done a Sundance and he was like that is an</v>

5363
02:24:57.811 --> 02:24:59.040
<v Speaker 6>inappropriate question.</v>

5364
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.600
<v Speaker 6>What a bitch.</v>

5365

02:25:02.911 --> 02:25:04.820
<v Speaker 6>Maybe shouldn't be a fucking professor.</v>

5368
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:07.830
<v Speaker 6>Kind of shocking to me that you can't tell me if you,</v>

5369
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:12.240
<v Speaker 6>if you'd done that or like I'm supposed to know the etiquette of Villa Cota.</v>

5372
02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:14.490
<v Speaker 6>I never learned that.</v>

5373
02:25:14.491 --> 02:25:16.920
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to ask someone if they did a Sundance.</v>

5374
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.761
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

02:25:17.761 --> 02:25:19.050
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to ask?</v>

5376
02:25:19.490 --> 02:25:20.930
<v Speaker 6>He said that's an inappropriate,</v>

5383
02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:28.360
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have the stones for it and he didn't want to admit it.</v>

5384
02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:29.313
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

5385
02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:32.890
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he think he was loke stir shit.</v>

02:25:33.490 --> 02:25:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe he wants you to think that he did it.</v>

5388
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's like one of those dudes who pretends as a black belt and really is</v>

5389
02:25:37.221 --> 02:25:38.740
<v Speaker 3>only taking karate a couple of times.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My hands are be registered lethal weapons.</v>

5391
02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5392
02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 3>It might've been one of those things you just didn't want to let you know that.</v>

5393
02:25:45.371 --> 02:25:45.611
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5394
02:25:45.611 --> 02:25:46.540
<v Speaker 3>of course I didn't do that.</v>

5395
02:25:46.541 --> 02:25:47.440
<v Speaker 3>That's for psychos.</v>

5396
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:48.341
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to let you think.</v>

5397
02:25:48.341 --> 02:25:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this Indian kinds of psycho made me feel like a fucking asshole though,</v>

5398
02:25:51.701 --> 02:25:51.911
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5399
02:25:51.911 --> 02:25:52.301
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5400
02:25:52.301 --> 02:25:52.541
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5401
02:25:52.541 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 3>why did I ask him about it?</v>

5402
02:25:53.741 --> 02:25:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's a douchebag and he's a douchebag.</v>

5403
02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:55.871
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>

5404
02:25:55.871 --> 02:25:56.890
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't recognize that,</v>

5405
02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:59.860
<v Speaker 3>if he honestly got offended about something that you were completely and utterly</v>

5406
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:00.694
<v Speaker 3>ignorant about,</v>

5407
02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 3>that means that obviously he's a dummy.</v>

5408
02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:05.410
<v Speaker 3>He's a either a dummy or a douchebag.</v>

5409
02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:06.340
<v Speaker 3>You're take your pick.</v>

5410
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5411
02:26:06.761 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 3>you can't recognize it.</v>

5412
02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:10.210
<v Speaker 3>People don't recognize that this is a,</v>

5413
02:26:10.211 --> 02:26:11.470
<v Speaker 3>a nutty thing to talk about.</v>

5414
02:26:11.770 --> 02:26:12.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5415
02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:15.580
<v Speaker 3>we don't recognize that it's something sacred to you.</v>

5416
02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:18.610
<v Speaker 3>W D fucking hooks through your nipples and get suspended for the air.</v>

5417
02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't ask you that cause it's kind of silly.</v>

5418
02:26:21.490 --> 02:26:22.210
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

5419
02:26:22.210 --> 02:26:23.043
<v Speaker 3>Inappropriate.</v>

5420
02:26:23.470 --> 02:26:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Inappropriate question.</v>

5421
02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Why did you ask why?</v>

5422
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't feel like she didn't walk away.</v>

5423
02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:30.940
<v Speaker 3>That guy should be fired.</v>

5424
02:26:31.410 --> 02:26:33.160
<v Speaker 3>You put your clothes back on and left in it.</v>

5425
02:26:33.161 --> 02:26:34.770
<v Speaker 3>You don't condition be someone next to him going,</v>

5426
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:35.623
<v Speaker 3>all right dude,</v>

5427
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:36.670
<v Speaker 3>chill the fuck out.</v>

5428
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't talk like that.</v>

5429
02:26:37.631 --> 02:26:38.200
<v Speaker 3>That's dump.</v>

5430
02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You can go back to teaching in class,</v>

5431
02:26:39.341 --> 02:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>but we have to let you know.</v>

5432
02:26:40.390 --> 02:26:41.620
<v Speaker 3>This is real life rules.</v>

5433
02:26:41.770 --> 02:26:44.050
<v Speaker 3>The ideal to ask a professor or anything?</v>

5434
02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5435
02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Especially I smoked weed with him of my professors.</v>

5436
02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

5437
02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Right before class.</v>

5438
02:26:48.071 --> 02:26:50.590
<v Speaker 3>And he even had like the fucking spray stuff.</v>

5439
02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5440
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:52.480
<v Speaker 3>so you won't smell like weed.</v>

5441
02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:53.401
<v Speaker 3>That's smart.</v>

5442
02:26:53.401 --> 02:26:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Smart professor.</v>

5443
02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:55.630
<v Speaker 3>He took a chance with use on,</v>

5444
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:59.920
<v Speaker 3>there was that professor at my college who is an anthropologist that,</v>

5445
02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:00.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5446
02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:01.810
<v Speaker 3>study tech it out like mushrooms.</v>

5447
02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

5448
02:27:02.290 --> 02:27:05.770
<v Speaker 3>And he was a Fulbright scholar and he said that missionaries came to,</v>

5449
02:27:05.771 --> 02:27:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember where it was,</v>

5450
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:07.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was South America,</v>

5451
02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

5452
02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 3>They came to this place in Mexico with all these new bibles that were translated</v>

5453
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:13.810
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

5454
02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:14.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5455
02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:19.750
<v Speaker 3>that were translated into their language and no one would touch the Bible's.</v>

5456
02:27:19.751 --> 02:27:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's avoiding the bibles and they wouldn't touch the bibles.</v>

5457
02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:23.530
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5458
02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:23.780
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

5459
02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:24.700
<v Speaker 3>the missionaries were like,</v>

5460
02:27:24.701 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 3>why aren't they touching these bible?</v>

5461
02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:26.261
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5462
02:27:26.261 --> 02:27:26.801
<v Speaker 3>the reason is,</v>

5463
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:28.870
<v Speaker 3>is because they had the,</v>

5464
02:27:28.871 --> 02:27:31.750
<v Speaker 3>translated the Bible into the word of God,</v>

5465
02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:32.950
<v Speaker 3>which translated,</v>

5466
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.851
<v Speaker 3>which was the,</v>

5467
02:27:33.851 --> 02:27:34.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5468
02:27:34.031 --> 02:27:34.960
<v Speaker 3>these people's,</v>

5469
02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:35.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5470
02:27:35.650 --> 02:27:36.850
<v Speaker 3>name for mushrooms.</v>

5471
02:27:36.850 --> 02:27:40.150
<v Speaker 3>The word of God was what they called mushrooms in their language.</v>

5472
02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.350
<v Speaker 3>It translated into a word of God.</v>

5473
02:27:41.351 --> 02:27:45.730
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason they didn't want to touch the bibles is because if they ate</v>

5474
02:27:45.731 --> 02:27:46.211
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>

5475
02:27:46.211 --> 02:27:49.150
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't have sex for like five days before and you weren't supposed to eat</v>

5476
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:52.660
<v Speaker 3>meat and there was a purification process and they were looking at the Bible's</v>

5477
02:27:52.661 --> 02:27:52.840
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

5478
02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:53.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

5479
02:27:53.171 --> 02:27:56.650
<v Speaker 3>we can't do that because it means we have to it like we haven't gone through the</v>

5480
02:27:56.651 --> 02:27:58.600
<v Speaker 3>steps that we do when we eat my shrimp.</v>

5481
02:27:58.601 --> 02:28:00.490
<v Speaker 3>So no sex for five days.</v>

5482
02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the specifics.</v>

5483
02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:06.220
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a purification they had to go undergo before they tripped out.</v>

5484
02:28:06.370 --> 02:28:06.611
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

5485
02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

5486
02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:09.220
<v Speaker 3>there's place in this world for ritual.</v>

5487
02:28:09.310 --> 02:28:12.880
<v Speaker 3>There's something that we get some sort of comfort from ritual,</v>

5488
02:28:12.970 --> 02:28:13.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5489
02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:15.700
<v Speaker 3>even if it's just a ritual of going to Disneyland every year,</v>

5490
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:17.020
<v Speaker 3>there's something comforting about it.</v>

5491
02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:17.681
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>

5492
02:28:17.681 --> 02:28:18.390
<v Speaker 3>I used to think that,</v>

5493
02:28:18.390 --> 02:28:19.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5494
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5495
02:28:19.391 --> 02:28:20.201
<v Speaker 3>holidays and shit,</v>

5496
02:28:20.201 --> 02:28:20.830
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked.</v>

5497
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:21.231
<v Speaker 3>The holidays,</v>

5498
02:28:21.231 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 3>he gives a fuck about Christmas.</v>

5499
02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:23.211
<v Speaker 6>But it was a really,</v>

5500
02:28:23.211 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 6>mostly because my childhood was kind of disappointing,</v>

5501
02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:25.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5502
02:28:25.881 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't because there's something wrong with rituals.</v>

5503
02:28:28.191 --> 02:28:30.470
<v Speaker 6>I was rebelling against something that wasn't fun for me,</v>

5504
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:30.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5505
02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:31.281
<v Speaker 6>not a,</v>

5506
02:28:31.281 --> 02:28:33.560
<v Speaker 6>not non fun environment growing up.</v>

5507
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:34.700
<v Speaker 6>But I think for,</v>

5508
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:38.570
<v Speaker 6>for most people like significations like that where this is,</v>

5509
02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:40.220
<v Speaker 6>you are a man now and you are,</v>

5510
02:28:40.221 --> 02:28:40.491
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5511
02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:41.450
<v Speaker 6>you have reached a,</v>

5512
02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.560
<v Speaker 6>a point of wisdom,</v>

5513
02:28:42.561 --> 02:28:42.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5514
02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:43.210
<v Speaker 6>where,</v>

5515
02:28:43.210 --> 02:28:45.710
<v Speaker 6>especially when they would actually have to work for it.</v>

5516
02:28:45.890 --> 02:28:47.000
<v Speaker 6>Like say what you want about,</v>

5517
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5518
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:48.043
<v Speaker 6>someone reaching,</v>

5519
02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:48.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5520
02:28:48.561 --> 02:28:48.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5521
02:28:48.890 --> 02:28:51.260
<v Speaker 6>go into confirmation classes to get confirmed as a,</v>

5522
02:28:51.261 --> 02:28:51.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5523
02:28:51.561 --> 02:28:54.040
<v Speaker 6>a Christian or a Catholic rather or you know,</v>

5524
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:55.130
<v Speaker 6>what you have to do to,</v>

5525
02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:55.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5526
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:56.351
<v Speaker 6>be a,</v>

5527
02:28:56.351 --> 02:28:59.690
<v Speaker 6>a man in the Jewish religion and read the towel mud and all the shit that</v>

5528
02:28:59.691 --> 02:29:00.680
<v Speaker 6>already had to go through.</v>

5529
02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:02.450
<v Speaker 6>That stuff makes them work.</v>

5530
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:07.570
<v Speaker 6>It makes them work towards something and it makes them at least believed that at</v>

5531
02:29:07.611 --> 02:29:10.130
<v Speaker 6>the end of the goal they have created something.</v>

5532
02:29:10.131 --> 02:29:12.080
<v Speaker 6>There's something different now they've accomplished something.</v>

5533
02:29:12.170 --> 02:29:13.400
<v Speaker 6>They've passed into the next thing.</v>

5534
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:14.450
<v Speaker 6>There's probably room for that.</v>

5535
02:29:14.451 --> 02:29:16.100
<v Speaker 6>That might be why we're all fucking lost.</v>

5536
02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:16.731
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5537
02:29:16.731 --> 02:29:18.500
<v Speaker 6>we don't have these like moments of,</v>

5538
02:29:18.501 --> 02:29:19.311
<v Speaker 6>of things happening.</v>

5539
02:29:19.311 --> 02:29:22.160
<v Speaker 6>So unless you do something difficult and then learn from it.</v>

5540
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:22.551
<v Speaker 6>I get,</v>

5541
02:29:22.551 --> 02:29:23.480
<v Speaker 6>I'll get any growth.</v>

5542
02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:23.901
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5543
02:29:23.901 --> 02:29:26.420
<v Speaker 6>you just get stagnant like we're were designed shitty.</v>

5544
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:26.901
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5545
02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:27.890
<v Speaker 6>and now what about that?</v>

5546
02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:31.220
<v Speaker 6>There's like an odd thing where you're not allowed to design new rituals.</v>

5547
02:29:31.221 --> 02:29:32.570
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to go buy a ritual,</v>

5548
02:29:32.571 --> 02:29:35.290
<v Speaker 6>you have to go by the Catholic ritual or wet,</v>

5549
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:37.280
<v Speaker 6>but why can't you come up with a new ritual?</v>

5550
02:29:37.281 --> 02:29:37.581
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

5551
02:29:37.581 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 6>You come up with some news too dangerous because the,</v>

5552
02:29:40.281 --> 02:29:44.330
<v Speaker 6>the reason why people want to lead people always is because they want money and</v>

5553
02:29:44.331 --> 02:29:44.890
<v Speaker 6>pussy.</v>

5554
02:29:44.890 --> 02:29:45.200
<v Speaker 6>All right?</v>

5555
02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.033
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>

5556
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:47.870
<v Speaker 6>That's the copters ethic.</v>

5557
02:29:47.871 --> 02:29:49.010
<v Speaker 6>That's really what they're looking for.</v>

5558
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.100
<v Speaker 6>Conquer Atha.</v>

5559
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.960
<v Speaker 6>So you see like,</v>

5560
02:29:50.961 --> 02:29:51.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5561
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.681
<v Speaker 6>Waco,</v>

5562
02:29:51.681 --> 02:29:52.520
<v Speaker 6>what happens in Waco,</v>

5563
02:29:52.521 --> 02:29:53.540
<v Speaker 6>dudes playing guitar,</v>

5564
02:29:53.541 --> 02:29:56.270
<v Speaker 6>fucking everyone's wife and he's got guns everywhere.</v>

5565
02:29:56.390 --> 02:29:57.141
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens.</v>

5566
02:29:57.141 --> 02:29:58.250
<v Speaker 6>That's the reality of,</v>

5567
02:29:58.251 --> 02:29:59.300
<v Speaker 6>of beginning religion.</v>

5568
02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:02.900
<v Speaker 6>It's most of the time the people that want true enlightenment don't want to</v>

5569
02:30:02.901 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 6>lead.</v>

5570
02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:05.210
<v Speaker 6>They just want to find it all.</v>

5571
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:07.160
<v Speaker 6>They want to be comfortable and happy.</v>

5572
02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:07.970
<v Speaker 6>They went everywhere,</v>

5573
02:30:07.970 --> 02:30:09.140
<v Speaker 6>but they don't want to be the man.</v>

5574
02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:09.671
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5575
02:30:09.671 --> 02:30:13.250
<v Speaker 6>once you want to be the man and you're fucking singing songs and you sit around</v>

5576
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:16.520
<v Speaker 6>the campfire talking about how we can create our own world shit,</v>

5577
02:30:16.521 --> 02:30:17.354
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5578
02:30:17.430 --> 02:30:17.740
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

5579
02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:19.160
<v Speaker 6>you're thinking about pussy and money.</v>

5580
02:30:19.161 --> 02:30:19.761
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing,</v>

5581
02:30:19.761 --> 02:30:20.270
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

5582
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 6>And it just confuses the fucking message.</v>

5583
02:30:22.970 --> 02:30:23.540
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5584
02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:24.490
<v Speaker 6>That's the fucking thing.</v>

5585
02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.400
<v Speaker 6>That's a confusing thing.</v>

5586
02:30:25.401 --> 02:30:27.800
<v Speaker 6>I read this essay by um,</v>

5587
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.611
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

5588
02:30:28.611 --> 02:30:29.300
<v Speaker 6>what's his name?</v>

5589
02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:29.481
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5590
02:30:29.481 --> 02:30:30.800
<v Speaker 6>Alistair Crowley.</v>

5591
02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:33.830
<v Speaker 6>And he was talking about the grail and he's like the thing,</v>

5592
02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:35.660
<v Speaker 6>that paradox of the grail,</v>

5593
02:30:35.661 --> 02:30:37.820
<v Speaker 6>which is like the thing that gives you a terminal life,</v>

5594
02:30:37.821 --> 02:30:42.821
<v Speaker 6>but what he was talking about enlightenment is that the moment you get it,</v>

5595
02:30:43.310 --> 02:30:44.690
<v Speaker 6>you can never enjoy it.</v>

5596
02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:46.130
<v Speaker 6>You can't want it.</v>

5597
02:30:46.131 --> 02:30:47.360
<v Speaker 6>You can't write it.</v>

5598
02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:49.910
<v Speaker 6>The wanting of the thing pushes it away.</v>

5599
02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:50.840
<v Speaker 6>It only,</v>

5600
02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:55.490
<v Speaker 6>and by the time you do receive all the material benefits that it gives you,</v>

5601
02:30:55.491 --> 02:30:57.380
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter to you anymore anyway.</v>

5602
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:59.180
<v Speaker 6>Don't you feel like that's the same thing with comedy?</v>

5603
02:30:59.370 --> 02:30:59.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5604
02:30:59.610 --> 02:31:00.381
<v Speaker 6>You think that is?</v>

5605
02:31:00.381 --> 02:31:01.480
<v Speaker 6>If you're looking for comedy,</v>

5606
02:31:01.481 --> 02:31:02.680
<v Speaker 6>if you're trying to make,</v>

5607
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:03.523
<v Speaker 6>get someone to laugh.</v>

5608
02:31:03.620 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird paradox where it's not about the trying,</v>

5609
02:31:06.081 --> 02:31:08.840
<v Speaker 6>it's about just a tuning in and letting it all happen.</v>

5610
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:11.450
<v Speaker 6>It's the same with everything like that is,</v>

5611
02:31:11.451 --> 02:31:12.800
<v Speaker 6>that's the way to do life,</v>

5612
02:31:12.801 --> 02:31:13.634
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5613
02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 6>That's a way to do life outside the ego.</v>

5614
02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:16.880
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing that I,</v>

5615
02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:18.800
<v Speaker 6>everything as far as comedy goes,</v>

5616
02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:23.670
<v Speaker 6>everything for me fucks up when I start caring about it in the wrong way.</v>

5617
02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:23.951
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5618
02:31:23.951 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 6>And I thinking about it under the wrong eyes,</v>

5619
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:28.020
<v Speaker 6>like trying to impress people or trying to,</v>

5620
02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:28.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5621
02:31:28.321 --> 02:31:29.011
<v Speaker 6>make something.</v>

5622
02:31:29.011 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

5623
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:29.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5624
02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:34.560
<v Speaker 6>it's not just an just it dishonest,</v>

5625
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5626
02:31:34.771 --> 02:31:35.970
<v Speaker 6>just launched is the best word.</v>

5627
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:38.050
<v Speaker 6>Not In tune.</v>

5628
02:31:38.050 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 6>It's not real.</v>

5629
02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:39.590
<v Speaker 6>You're just,</v>

5630
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5631
02:31:39.841 --> 02:31:40.651
<v Speaker 6>and there's comics,</v>

5632
02:31:40.651 --> 02:31:42.960
<v Speaker 6>there's like certain comic that a friend of mine just work with recently.</v>

5633
02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:44.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to mention any names,</v>

5634
02:31:44.430 --> 02:31:45.390
<v Speaker 6>but a buddy of mine,</v>

5635
02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:49.530
<v Speaker 6>he middled for this guy and the guy just ate shit every night.</v>

5636
02:31:49.531 --> 02:31:52.560
<v Speaker 6>And he was saying how embarrassing it was that this guy is just,</v>

5637
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.920
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

5638
02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:55.290
<v Speaker 6>his act just wasn't connecting.</v>

5639
02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:55.591
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

5640
02:31:55.591 --> 02:31:56.670
<v Speaker 6>it felt artificial,</v>

5641
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:57.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5642
02:31:57.271 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 6>and that's what happens to some guys.</v>

5643
02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:01.950
<v Speaker 6>They lose their connection with whatever it is that allows you to create</v>

5644
02:32:01.951 --> 02:32:05.220
<v Speaker 6>creative things in the first place and then all of sudden it becomes something,</v>

5645
02:32:05.490 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 6>something fake and something that you don't,</v>

5646
02:32:07.501 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what it is and you're using it because it's worked before,</v>

5647
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:11.610
<v Speaker 6>but it's just like,</v>

5648
02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:12.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5649
02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:12.870
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5650
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:15.780
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean anything to you anymore because you lost the fucking trail.</v>

5651
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:18.280
<v Speaker 6>There's the ants and the spot.</v>

5652
02:32:18.370 --> 02:32:18.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5653
02:32:18.930 --> 02:32:20.380
<v Speaker 6>You're in that fucking spiraling.</v>

5654
02:32:20.381 --> 02:32:21.214
<v Speaker 6>He can't get out.</v>

5655
02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:21.900
<v Speaker 6>And you can,</v>

5656
02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:22.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5657
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:23.520
<v Speaker 6>you can do that your whole life.</v>

5658
02:32:23.540 --> 02:32:25.250
<v Speaker 6>If you don't get slapped back end.</v>

5659
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:27.870
<v Speaker 6>How do you slap someone back and you can't write,</v>

5660
02:32:27.871 --> 02:32:29.130
<v Speaker 6>they have to slap themselves in.</v>

5661
02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:29.641
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5662
02:32:29.641 --> 02:32:31.200
<v Speaker 6>I think you can slap somebody back in,</v>

5663
02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:32.034
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to be,</v>

5664
02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:35.660
<v Speaker 6>they have to really respect to you and you have to want us change too.</v>

5665
02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:37.620
<v Speaker 6>But it definitely can be done.</v>

5666
02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:38.970
<v Speaker 6>And there's different versions of it,</v>

5667
02:32:38.971 --> 02:32:39.804
<v Speaker 6>but it's like,</v>

5668
02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:40.561
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5669
02:32:40.561 --> 02:32:41.394
<v Speaker 6>that's what a free,</v>

5670
02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:43.080
<v Speaker 6>ideally what a friend does.</v>

5671
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:46.020
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that it's all a mathematical pattern.</v>

5672
02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:49.380
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that from the time the Greeks were around to the Romans and it</v>

5673
02:32:49.381 --> 02:32:49.980
<v Speaker 6>goes through,</v>

5674
02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:50.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5675
02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:53.070
<v Speaker 6>the Egyptians and the Mayans and every civilization does this.</v>

5676
02:32:53.250 --> 02:32:56.370
<v Speaker 6>Every civilization gets to a point where people are just soft and fucking stupid</v>

5677
02:32:56.371 --> 02:32:57.690
<v Speaker 6>and then shit hits the fan.</v>

5678
02:32:57.691 --> 02:32:58.051
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5679
02:32:58.051 --> 02:32:58.501
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

5680
02:32:58.501 --> 02:32:59.070
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5681
02:32:59.070 --> 02:32:59.970
<v Speaker 6>and it starts again.</v>

5682
02:32:59.971 --> 02:33:00.960
<v Speaker 6>And then we leave the,</v>

5683
02:33:00.961 --> 02:33:01.301
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5684
02:33:01.301 --> 02:33:05.670
<v Speaker 6>the rotting husks of the society left behind us as we a new one somewhere else.</v>

5685
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:08.760
<v Speaker 6>What a great way to end the podcast.</v>

5686
02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:10.180
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

5687
02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:10.770
