1
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.243
Okay.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.150
<v 1>The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.</v>

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:11.930
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in

4
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:13.040
the code named Rogan,

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.600
you will get 15% off the number one sex toy from men.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.490
Shazamm bitches,

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.170
Jamie kill scenes in the house.
And we don't even,

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.000
we don't start this thing and experience.
So we get the music going.
I Dunno why

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.660
<v 0>now it feels like a show.
I</v>

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.140
don't know why it's a little weak ass psychologic.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.940
<v 1>I circled trick from my bitch ass mind.</v>

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.480
If you hear a slight hum in the background,
ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.320
that's the issue for starting this so late on Ustream.

14
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:49.780
There's something going on with our mixer.
So we've got to get a new mixer.

15
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.130
So Brian has a duct tape this pitch together for this podcast and we're going
to,

16
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.410
um,
Jamie Kilstein knows about all this shit,
man.

17
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.840
This is the trials and tribulations of running a podcast.

18
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.470
He runs a citizen radio and James a standup comic and he's also a mixed martial

19
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:09.920
arts fanatic.
Loves the fights and just an all around.
Good Dude.
Thanks buddy.

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.970
You're,
you are defined by your diet.
However,

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 2>I don't know how that happened.
You're a Vegan man.
It's a tricky thing to be.</v>

22
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.390
I was saying the other day like it's uh,
what's crazy is like,

23
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:24.620
so I'm already like a niche of a niche of a niche fucking comic.
Right?
Right.

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.820
She tell everybody very left wing,
very political.
But I also like,

25
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.230
but then I get fucked with lefties because I'm a comic so it's like a language

26
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:34.490
issue or like I hate,
oh,

27
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:37.760
I think I'm furious at fucking Obama and the majority of the Democrats.

28
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.100
So like it's very hard to like our show,

29
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.740
but like we've managed to like carve out this cool niche audience.

30
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.700
But even with them,
the Vegan thing,
it's still like,

31
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.980
I can literally get up on stage and be like,
you know,

32
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.310
the wars and illegal occupation and my people will be like,
fuck the war.

33
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.860
Or I'll be like,
people use religion as the excuse to hate gays.

34
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.990
And they were like,
fuck religion.
And that'll be like,

35
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.360
sometimes I like to eat portabella mushrooms and they're like,

36
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.150
you pussy mother fucker.
Like fuck you.
And there's,

37
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.390
so I got booted a Democratic fundraiser for saying I'm a Vegan.

38
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.670
And it's like really?
It's like you fuckers

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.910
<v 1>they booed or for your dietary choices.
That's an interesting,</v>

40
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.330
it's the one dietary choice.
It has a strong message to it though.
Cause Yeah.

41
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:15.660
Yeah.

42
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.010
<v 2>I mean I think that,</v>

43
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
I think people automatically feel like you are judging them when you say you

44
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.290
don't do that.
Right?
Yeah.
Because there's no connotation.
I mean people,

45
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.210
they don't want to think about it.
I never,

46
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.860
when I used to eat a ton of meat and don't get me wrong,

47
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.550
the reason I'll never be able to be like preachy is because I will never be able

48
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.850
to make up for the amount of fucking spam I ate or like Taco Bell,

49
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.320
like my damage has been done.

50
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:41.920
I'm just trying to like repent for me at this point and like,
uh,
but uh,

51
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.400
there's a disassociation,
right?
So when you're eating the hamburger,

52
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.600
it's a hamburger.
It's a new word to you.
It was not a cow die the way it died.

53
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.920
When you uh,
make nugget,

54
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.080
like you don't think of it as like a little chicken or whatever.

55
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.720
And so I think when you say I'm a Vegan,

56
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.570
that's saying I don't need animals and that's automatically making the other

57
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.190
person think like,
well,
I don't want to fucking think about that.

58
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.200
<v 3>Like no one wants to,
no one eats a burger.</v>

59
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.560
Even your fucking tough like dudes who were just like,
yeah man,

60
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.880
I'll watch the video,
I'll torture myself.
It's like,
will you like you,

61
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.890
you can't even walk to the store to get pre made me to like,

62
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.340
you're not going to fucking go kill a boar with weapons unit.

63
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.470
You know what I mean?
Like no one wants to think about that.

64
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.990
They just want to eat it.
It looks fried.
It doesn't look like an animal.

65
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.690
It doesn't have a face.
And by you saying you don't do it,

66
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.860
I think that makes them think about it.

67
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:28.120
And that's a real hard time accepting that other people allowed to make

68
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.380
different choices other than them,

69
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.860
whether it's getting a fucking windows computer or whether it's,
you know,

70
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.970
going with at and t over Verizon,
people are fucking crazy.
I know.

71
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.000
And that's half of it.
Why would anybody give a fuck?

72
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.400
I do not like self righteous vegans.

73
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.210
I do not like people who are constantly in people's faces about,
you know,

74
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.520
cruelty to animals and I you,

75
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.521
you are absolutely correct for factory farming is a fucking atrocious bipap

76
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.640
product of civilization and the detachment from the natural world.
Again,

77
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.320
that sense Ted Nugent's got it.
Right.
Like if you want to eat meat motherfucker,

78
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.870
you should be out there with the fucking boat.
And I got like a bow and arrow.

79
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.460
Yeah.
Take that shit down yourself.

80
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:11.461
And that's the real experience when you buy something ramped up and some fucking

81
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:16.120
cellophane plastic thing at the supermarket and you need it,
that's,

82
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.570
there is a disconnect.
But the vegans that like give people shit,

83
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.750
they're just as country as the people who stand outside of abortion clinics.

84
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.120
I know what I'm saying.
She's anything.
Yes,
exactly.
Now that's it.

85
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.230
And like I know like your listeners can relate to,

86
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.790
especially the ones who are super into politics.

87
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.660
It's like when there is information that you have and you know the majority of

88
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.860
people don't have it,
you go create,

89
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.380
I mean there's part of me that starting to think those crazy fucking like

90
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.910
homeless people you see in New York,

91
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:42.700
they're like are waving a book around and like just screaming chip for all we

92
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.900
know.
They're the smart ones.

93
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.390
They're the ones that actually like finish the Chomsky book.
And I'm like,

94
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.150
why aren't you guys fucking paying attention to who gives a shit about the dead

95
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:53.110
baby and whatever her name is.
You know,
like seriously.

96
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:54.230
Like maybe they're the smarter ones.

97
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.110
Just people have just ignored him for years and they're like,
that's it.

98
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:58.990
I'm taking it to the bus.
Well they probably have some good points,

99
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.870
but I don't think those

100
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.410
always go against the guy living on the streets screaming at no one.
Okay,
look,

101
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.100
they've made some bad life to say this clearly.
But you're right,
man.
I mean,

102
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.610
you go deep into the fucking back of the Chomsky books and you do that for
years.

103
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:16.630
You could really lose your mind thinking that nothing you can do helps.

104
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:17.464
And that this,

105
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.640
this world is on a downward spiral that is unstoppable and uncontrollable.

106
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.670
And a lot of people would say the intelligent thing to do would be just to enjoy

107
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:27.730
the moment.
You know,
it was a great hunter s Thompson quote.

108
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:30.580
The light became a measurably better once I was forced to stop taking it

109
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.590
seriously.
And I tweeted it last week.

110
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:37.591
But really when we have to accept at some level that we are temporary organisms,

111
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.180
you,
you should have causes,
you should have ideas,
you should have,

112
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.880
you should have,
you know,
points to the way you,

113
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.920
your philosophy works and the way you look at life.

114
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.820
But you've gotta be careful about wasting your whole life on that shit.
Yeah,

115
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:49.390
sure.
Man.
I mean,
the key is you can't use the,

116
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.240
that you can't use that negativity as an excuse to do nothing to be apathetic.

117
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.280
I mean,
we've had chops down or show like five times.

118
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.070
And at first we were joking around that even if you're,
that we were like,

119
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.310
you know,
what's your favorite thing to do?

120
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.520
Would be like cut myself while watching Al Jazeera.
Like,
I mean,
the dude's like,

121
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.730
he's not really the bearer of good news.
But we ended our interview,

122
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.400
we end our interviews by being like,
you know,
what makes you happy?

123
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.530
And he suddenly,
he just fucking lit up and he's like,

124
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.650
people marching in the street,
people holding truth to power.
You know,

125
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.400
people who are doing radio shows like this.
I mean,
like once you dig deep,

126
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.720
because here's the thing is like when I was a,
a teenager,
I was like,

127
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.590
just smart enough to give myself an excuse to do nothing.
You know what I mean?

128
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.960
It would be like,
why don't you vote?
Because both parties are the same.

129
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.810
Why don't you watch the news?
Because they're all owned by corporations.
Now,

130
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.650
both of those are fucking 100% true.
Uh,
but with that said,

131
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.520
you can run for office,
you can support a third party.
You can petition,
uh,

132
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.160
the Democrats to actually do what they say they're going to do for the news.

133
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.250
You can watch independent news.
You can watch Al Jazeera,
you can watch the BBC,

134
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.230
you can read out of country newspapers.

135
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:48.950
But I think a lot of people use all the conspiratorial shit to do nothing.

136
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.170
You know,
you have liberals who were sitting there and they're like,
man,

137
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.490
fuck the corporations,

138
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.400
and they have their Budweiser beer and they're Philip Morris,
cigarette factory,

139
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.520
farm stick.
They're like,
where are these corporations getting all the money?
No,

140
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.720
I'm not.
I'm down.
I'm down.
You know,
it's,
it's from you.

141
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.610
You got to actually like do something and not,

142
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.640
it's really fun to go to a bar and talk shit and then wake up and do nothing.

143
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.650
You know?
At a certain point though,

144
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.790
some people feel like there's nothing you can do.
You can try and you can,

145
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.270
you can dance in the street and you can march,
but things don't change.

146
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.440
A black guy gets an office and 30,000 more people get shipped off to
Afghanistan.

147
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.670
All the bombing continues and he wins the Nobel Peace Prize.
I'm still,

148
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.220
the bombing continues man,

149
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.680
drones and Pakistan and who knows what the fuck is going on and all sorts of

150
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.330
creepy corners of this world.
Right?
I mean,

151
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.810
how can you stand up for that bully are adorable because,
well,

152
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.830
it's because like we said,
Mac and windows and flooding,
the 18 teen Verizon,

153
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.370
I'm on team Democrat man now.

154
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.770
And you as a lefty have to be careful because you know,
if you start shitting on,

155
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:44.900
you know,
you start telling the truth,
you know,

156
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.640
and not having some team that you're on and you gotta say,
Hey man,
I've,

157
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.080
Obama is operating for corporations.
He's fucking us over.

158
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.650
He's fucking the whole picture over.
Yep.
And I mean we get more shit from,

159
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.050
I would rather a conservative comes straight at me and be like,

160
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.360
here's what I disagree with.
I think we can have a conversation.
Right.

161
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.590
What makes me more mad was he makes you feel crazy as the Obama people who just

162
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.470
can't admit when he does.
You know where it's just like,
hey,
why didn't he,

163
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.050
why didn't he get us universal healthcare,
like you said,
it's just like,

164
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.130
don't talk about him.
It's the worship.
The leadership.

165
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.700
Where's that universal healthcare.
Well,

166
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.980
he had to compromise on that because he was going to close Guantanamo open.

167
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.260
Now we didn't close Guantanamo.
I mean,
that's what,
that's the way it works.

168
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.220
If you don't have a billions of dollars,
you know,

169
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.220
it's really hard to get your voice heard.
I mean,

170
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.090
it's crazy and that's when I do understand people just wanting to do nothing or

171
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.700
just,
you know,
live off the land somewhere.

172
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.960
I will not believe that a guy like Ron Paul or Gary Johnson can get elected.

173
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:39.590
I do not believe know it works.
I do not believe it's real.

174
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.770
I believe you absolutely have to be playing in the game to get into that

175
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:44.930
position.
I don't think they'll ever let those guys win.

176
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.310
I don't think they'll ever let anybody win who wants to completely revamped this

177
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:53.210
entire corrupt,
fucked up pile of bullshit.

178
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.530
That's why local elections matters.
That is true though.
You know,
if that's true,

179
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.580
you local elections are what really counts your community,
your city,
for sure.

180
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.070
That that's real.
That's real politics,
Ron Paul too.
I mean,
even with that,

181
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:08.670
it's like it's one of those things where you want,
you want to,

182
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.890
you want to call yourself.
Most people who listen to your show,

183
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.450
I bet a lot of them call themselves libertarians.

184
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.010
I wanted to call myself a libertarian.
Why?

185
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.830
Because we see Democrats and Republicans and they're all kinds,
right,

186
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.840
but never tearing and you think great because you hear like legalized drugs in a

187
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.840
stay out of the bedroom in and then suddenly it's like get rid of all public

188
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:27.720
schools and you're like,
what the fuck was that?
And they're like,
no drugs.
We eat.

189
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.740
And you're like,
no,
go back to the school thing motherfucker.

190
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.300
And the problem is when you want,
when you want to prioritize everything.

191
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.610
What industries do we have from privatization?
You have,

192
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:37.860
you have companies like blackwater who were fucking over the troops.

193
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.620
You have the healthcare lobby or a lobby,
the pharmaceuticals.

194
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.300
Whenever you're doing something for factory farming,

195
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.530
whenever you're doing something for profit,

196
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.020
you're trying to do it as fast and as profitable as possible.

197
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.540
So people get fucked over in the end,
you know?

198
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.080
But our number one miss is the,

199
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.520
the education and this and the idea that you would make all education private

200
00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:00.660
and make poor people not have access to and have to raise her own kids and put

201
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:04.860
their own kids through homeschooling year.
That's,
that's completely ridiculous.

202
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.090
Well,
that shit's happening right now.
I mean,

203
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.390
you look at all these budget cuts and you know,
people just forget.

204
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.610
People vote against their own interests all the time.
You know,
can I have to,

205
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.640
I've had some of the best conversations with conservatives either ever,

206
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.490
ever after a show.
Cause they'll come up to me and they'll say,
hey,

207
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.440
I didn't agree with you,
but you were funny.
And then I'll be like,
wait,
stop.
Like,

208
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.400
let's talk.
And then like,
what don't you agree with me on?
Right.

209
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.500
And the conversations usually goes something like this,

210
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.660
well I don't really care about gay people anymore.

211
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:29.100
That's more like an older generation.

212
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.920
Like they can fucking do whatever they want if a gay friend.
And it's like,

213
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:36.300
well what if like what if like a soldier comes back and he really needs like

214
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.380
assistant,
he's like,
oh my God,

215
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:38.820
what was holder comes back and he needs assistance.

216
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:40.860
The government should totally help him out.
And then I'm like,
all right,

217
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.900
so why are you Republican?
It's like my dad is.

218
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.740
And like if you just talk about it,
you can find fucking solutions.
You know,

219
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.650
I don't think that that person's going to go out and open like his own mom and

220
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:53.010
pop abortion shop.
Cause he liked the funny liberal comedian.
Uh,

221
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.450
but you start to see shit you agree on and you start to realize that you just

222
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:00.750
don't hear those middle ground solutions.
Uh,
on the news.

223
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.140
People think of Republican and Democrat.
It's very simple.

224
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.170
The characters are very clearly laid out.
There's a,
you know,
there's,

225
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.720
there's a fucking cowboy and an Indian.
It's real simple.

226
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:13.830
The Democrat is always like really loose and with,

227
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.550
with spending they want to overspend and community things.
They're very soft,

228
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.560
soft on crime,
soft on war.

229
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:22.680
So often defense and then Republicans are no nonsense.

230
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.580
People are Republicans or be bolded,
probably believe in God and don't want to,

231
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.610
you know,
don't want to deal with too many hippies in the yard and that's,

232
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.740
you know,
you would get them cylon party.

233
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:34.950
Yeah they get off my lawn party and I mean that's how we look at it in our
heads.

234
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.780
So when when when you get on one of those fucking teams and you just limit

235
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:42.600
yourself to that,
you know,
did that box that you're operating it,

236
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.390
it's a very weird thing that we like to do to be on these teams.

237
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.380
That is bizarre and wine.

238
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:49.460
I think that's why so many people like I think that's why the libertarian
things,

239
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:52.430
he'll pass.
You just need a label.
And even if you don't have any label,

240
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.450
you don't have a,
what do you say?
You proudly declare yourself an independent.

241
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.150
I'm above the fray and part of me wants to be like,

242
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.700
just pick a side and start losing friends like the rest of us mother fucker.

243
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.160
You know what I mean?
Station with a buddy of mine is a really brilliant guy.

244
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:06.010
He's a writer.
He's like,
well,
you know I'm a Democrat so I want us to win,

245
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.420
so get the fuck are you talking about man,
you want us to citizens the Dodgers?

246
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.540
That asshole doesn't have you in mind,
man.
Trust me.

247
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.940
He will send you off to war and you'll come back with no legs dark.

248
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.600
This is ridiculous.
I think the future's going to be like,

249
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.120
I'm on team anonymous or something like that.

250
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.250
Have you been listening to like what that that lately they're going to,
yeah,

251
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.861
that's crazy.

252
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.700
Those guys mean what they're doing with anonymous is doing is they are choosing

253
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.220
people that they think are cunts and they're going after him and they're not

254
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.120
doing it for profit.

255
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.660
They're doing it and they're doing it on their own and they're doing it in

256
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:39.940
anonymously and they're eaten meeting an IRC channels and so far they've been

257
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:41.060
fucking successful.
At,

258
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.680
I mean there's this generation could possibly be generation of the hackers and

259
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.420
that would be pretty fucking bad ass.

260
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.810
It's very clear that there's a certain level of society that knows way more

261
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.530
about computers than the average versa.

262
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.030
I know these little crazy motherfuckers can't get into systems bad.

263
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.840
They could steal credit cards and all kinds of shit.
It's fascinating really.

264
00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.321
I mean,

265
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:03.430
it's fascinating on one hand that there's these people that are so intertwined

266
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:07.390
in the operating systems and that they are able to make these back doors and

267
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:11.500
able to get into people's computers through emails.
Rupert's stepping down,

268
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.830
you know,
is he stepping down?

269
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.180
That's what I heard last is that he was stepping down because of the recent

270
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.680
hacking over,
you know,
he was on trial today.
I heard he got a pie in the face.

271
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:23.260
I didn't hear about the stepping down though.
No,
let me get,

272
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.530
how exactly is he implicated?
Did he know that they were,

273
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:31.040
if for people who don't know Rupert Murdoch's company,
his corporation is a news.

274
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.040
People over there were,
um,

275
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.100
apparently bugging people's phones and even possibly victims from September 11

276
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.110
and from the seven,
seven attacks in London.

277
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.350
And they were getting information from people talking on these just to break the

278
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:44.681
story.

279
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:48.730
And it was even more fucked up about that is sometimes cause they were running

280
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:53.410
out of memory,
they would,
uh,
they would,
they would delete messages.
Uh,

281
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:58.150
so certain people,
I've just lost our messenger.
There was one case where like,
ah,

282
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.460
when they,

283
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.080
because they heard it was just what this single murder in the UK because they

284
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:06.780
heard the message deleted.
They thought that she was still alive and she raised,

285
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.110
she was deleting her messages.
She was still alive when she was fucking dead.

286
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.090
Oh my God.
But you know,

287
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:16.480
the story that's not really being talked about is Rupert Murdoch lost a really

288
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.390
gigantic bid,
uh,
for

289
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.870
<v 2>a big station at the BBC.</v>

290
00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:24.110
That would've given him like pretty much the most media in the UK show much

291
00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:24.944
media in fact,

292
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.430
that it would be illegal to own that much media in other countries.
Right.

293
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.290
And this is the problem.
Even if you are right wing,

294
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:31.490
even if you do watch Fox News,

295
00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:36.260
at no point do you want one dude owning so much of the information you get.

296
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.520
You remember it's books,
TV,
newspapers,
magazines that you're just getting,

297
00:14:40.521 --> 00:14:41.600
you know,
you turn on Fox News,

298
00:14:41.601 --> 00:14:44.030
you read the Wall Street Journal coming from the same people,
right?

299
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.850
And it goes overseas and he was bigger and bigger and bigger and that's what you

300
00:14:46.851 --> 00:14:47.171
don't want.

301
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:49.820
Do you want to be able to get your news sources from as many places as possible

302
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:52.070
so you can compare and find

303
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.000
<v 3>out who's full of shit,</v>

304
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.010
really amazing that someone has such a bad motherfucker then they could rocket

305
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.790
like that in 2011 now.
I mean,

306
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:01.970
it's really incredible that a Rupert Murdoch can still exist.
I mean,

307
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:05.150
we're not in the age of William Randolph Hearst where he really had his own

308
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.780
paper manufacturing companies and he,

309
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.670
his own paper mills and he actually grew forest,
grew the paper,
cut the paper,

310
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:12.504
sent the paper out,

311
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.890
printed whatever the fuck he wanted on it and sent it out for sure.
I mean,

312
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.320
this happens all the time.
I mean,
it happens with lobbyists and politicians.

313
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:20.630
As you see,
the lobbyists are writing half of the laws.

314
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.930
They're just giving them to the politicians.
You know what I mean?

315
00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:25.180
You talked about that last week with Brian Calendar.

316
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.460
It was a good buddy of mine who's a very well versed and the political system.

317
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:31.940
When we got deep into the whole idea of lobbyists,
it's fucking criminal.

318
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.240
It should be completely against the law,
especially the,
you know,
they'll,

319
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:38.210
they'll sign a bill that favors Comcast and suddenly they quit and they're

320
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:42.200
working for Comcast.
Yeah.
It's like,
how is that?
That's like cartoonishly evil,

321
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:46.750
you know what I mean?
Did you see the,
um,
uh,
the movie on the financial crisis?
Um,

322
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.910
uh,
I know what you're talking about inside job now and actually I heard it

323
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:53.950
fascinating.
It's so good,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's fucking incredible.
But it's,

324
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:55.190
it's really heartbreaking too.

325
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:58.310
And one of the things that's in it is how many of these professors of economics

326
00:15:58.311 --> 00:16:01.900
at big universities eventually wind up getting big jobs,
working,

327
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.290
working for companies,
and they get fucking multimillion dollar paid it.
I mean,

328
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.410
it's,
it's really simple.

329
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:09.040
Why they choose to allow certain things that they allowed.
I mean they,

330
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.280
they decided that systematically they were gonna make the,

331
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.130
all these porous holes in the economy that they could exploit.
The,
the,

332
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:17.450
the good news is the Internet.

333
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.300
I mean we were talking before about like not only generation of,
of uh,

334
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.190
of the hackers,

335
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:25.100
so like that's bad ass and I think all of us got our kind of like Jason Bourne

336
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:28.640
fantasies were like,
awesome.
Uh,
but it's also like shows like that.

337
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.600
Like you don't,
the flashlight's not going to call you and be like,
oh,

338
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:35.930
you were talking a little bit too much about these lobbyists jail.
Like,

339
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:38.360
you know what I mean?
Why don't you take it fucking easy on the bankers?

340
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.410
Like they're not going to do it.

341
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:43.250
We don't have any fucking sponsors where we can say whatever we want.
These,

342
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.680
the blogs are starting to take over the newspapers.
Why?

343
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.120
Because people like computers more.
No,

344
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:49.970
because the newspapers fucked us and the newspapers started doing,
you know,

345
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:52.490
the New York Times,
which is known as like the big liberal rag.

346
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.830
They essentially get memos from the white.

347
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:57.160
They have to get permission from the White House to,
to,

348
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.420
to print the stories with the Jordan.
That's the reason the wiretapping story.

349
00:17:00.421 --> 00:17:02.690
It took two to three years on the Bush administration was like,

350
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:06.440
can you sit on that?
And they were like,
all right.
And,
and that's,

351
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.810
that's our intrepid journalists today.
That's the liberal New York Times.

352
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:12.320
They just fucking sat on it for Bush.
Yeah.

353
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:14.600
And then they broke it and they were called treasonous or whatever.

354
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:18.110
And it's like,
that's your job.
Your job as a journalist,
isn't it?

355
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:21.530
Tried to get invited isn't to try to beat fucking chuck Todd at these White

356
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.230
House parties were just drinking the wine and reporting on the White House soup

357
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:27.740
of the day.
That's for just pussy cunt.
That's all you are.

358
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.210
Phone boots up and there's a picture of you next to Obama.
All it is just,
yeah,

359
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:35.220
just the leaning in like a,
that's all it is,
man.

360
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.540
And these people are just fucking mouthpieces for war criminals.

361
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.750
That's what you do now.
You're,
you're just a fucking year an actor.

362
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:42.850
You're not doing anything original,

363
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.740
you're just a page or given lies and you fucking read those lines.

364
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:50.170
But if it is true that a guy like Ron Paul will never be allowed to slip through

365
00:17:50.171 --> 00:17:54.210
the system if they can rig the machines like it was proven they did during the

366
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:56.400
Bush administration with the Diebold system,

367
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:58.110
which eventually they had to change their name,

368
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:01.830
but there's a bunch of moves hacking democracy's a great documentary on it where

369
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:06.600
you can watch now has burnt off absolutely 100% proven that it was designed to

370
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:10.560
be altered by a third source.
It was designed so that you could rig voting like,

371
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.650
and no one went to jail for that.
You know what I'm saying?

372
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.250
But if that's true,
if we,
if we agree on this,

373
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.440
that a guy like Ron Paul's never going to get through a guy who is going to

374
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:21.270
radically change the system is never gonna be able to get through.

375
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.870
What is this then?
This is not really democracy.
This is horse shit.

376
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:29.260
This is an imperial lakes and imperialist nation.
This is the,
they're,

377
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.640
they're an empire.
I mean,
it's a corporate empty empire now,
right?

378
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:36.600
You're 100% rights.
So that gives you an excuse to be like,
oh,
okay,

379
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:38.760
well let's just fucking get high and suicide pact that,

380
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.330
but the good news is what you can do besides getting the information out on the

381
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:45.780
Internet.
I don't hunt for resources.
Uh,
would,
you can also do is you just,

382
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:49.710
you have to be really loud because if someone like Ron Paul or Ralph Nader,

383
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:53.370
who by the way agree on a ton,
uh,
if someone like them,

384
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.860
if they get into the debates,
if they get petitioning enough,

385
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:59.400
if people are loud enough and not like,
oh,
well marching is fucking stupid.

386
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.100
Like if they're loud enough and they can get someone like that in the debates,

387
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.610
what that does is that steers the conversation.
Right?
And it makes that,

388
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.090
cause they're gonna happen with Obama once he got out of the primaries,

389
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.140
it's just him and McCain.

390
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.690
So is he going to pander to the left or is it gonna Pander to the right?

391
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.250
Clearly he's going to pander to the right.

392
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.340
If you still have someone like Ralph Nader or Ron Paul in there as well,

393
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:21.210
pushing back and they actually see that as a threat instead of just this blind

394
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:24.660
warship to Obama,
they see a third candidate has as a threat.

395
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.570
They're going to need to start pandering towards Ron Paul's direction.

396
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:30.170
They're going to start to need to start pandering towards,
uh,

397
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.210
Ralph Nader's direction.
I mean,
the bottom line is,
even if you're rigging voting,

398
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.930
what percentage of America votes?
I mean,
it's pathetic,
right?

399
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.170
You have to inspire all these young kids who were at home getting high,

400
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:42.870
but don't vote that you want to get high fucking on your front lawn.

401
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.280
You have to go out and do something.

402
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.250
You have to actually go out and vote or be loud.

403
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:51.510
And that's why it only think that example.
It only changes on the state level.

404
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.330
I mean,
that's what the United States of America supposed to be.

405
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:56.190
It's supposed to be about local government.

406
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:59.130
It's only supposed to band together in times of war,
right?

407
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.350
I mean the idea of medical marijuana,

408
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.710
they did change it in California and then the federal government can override
it.

409
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.560
Exactly.
And that's where it gets creepy.
Yeah.
That's where it gets really fun.

410
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.250
That's where it gets imperialist.
That's where it gets the,
you're in an empire.

411
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:11.530
You're,

412
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.170
there's a bunch of people who arbitrarily decide what you are not allowed to

413
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.490
vote on in your states.
And that's against the fucking constitution for sure.
Man.

414
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.380
That's against how this whole bizarre system of self government was ever
created.

415
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.190
It was created so that we could get away from all the bullshit that they were

416
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:32.580
doing in other countries in Europe.
And it's just chest thumping.
I mean,
look,

417
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:34.950
these politicians don't give a shit about pot.
They don't give a shit.

418
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:37.440
They do though because pharmaceutical companies give a shit about,

419
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.170
cause it's very,
very damaging to their profit line.

420
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.130
But it's also more so just a tough guy thing.
Dude.

421
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.570
It could kill the pharmaceutical industry.

422
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:50.050
Like the MP three industry or the MP three creation killed the music industry.

423
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.930
It could marijuana.
If marijuana was legal,

424
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:57.190
would crush the pharmaceutical industry,
they would lose billions of dollars.

425
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.060
No question about it.

426
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.300
There's going to be a lot of shit that you still need for high blood pressure or

427
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:04.140
glaucoma or whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.
There's something,

428
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.670
there's going to be useless for pharmaceutical companies,
but make no mistake,

429
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.480
let's take about it.

430
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.570
They're going to lose a giant chunk of the business that's like,

431
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.920
that's why it's illegal.

432
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:16.090
It's 100% just fucking jerk offs running around saying that they're trying to

433
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.570
protect people.
Meanwhile,
cigarettes are readily available everywhere.

434
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.210
The most insane 400,000 plus people in America,

435
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.920
5 million worldwide now directly die prematurely as a result of cigarette.

436
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.890
Can I also bring up that even more than that die from heart disease and cancer

437
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.200
and a leading cause of that is a bad diet.

438
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.890
Is it a leading cause that or is it being a fat fuck with a bad diet and then it

439
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.780
could be being a fat fuck with it that it's mostly being a fat fuck.

440
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.220
You know you can eat a lot of meat and be healthy as fuck.

441
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.710
You just have to need that shit and you have to burn it off.

442
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.090
I was a fucking end before I went vegan.

443
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.270
I was at fatty vegetarian and like well cause I was just like,

444
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:54.250
oh I mean healthy man because I'm not eating meat and I,

445
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.860
it was like macaroni and cheese and pizza and I was just like,

446
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:58.390
yeah I'll see you fuckers at the top.

447
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.140
We like Jamie has a bag of fucking food that he brings with him on a plane.

448
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.340
You're like pretty pretty dedicated to this and packed up and like little bags

449
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.120
and do you have a little Tupperware?
It just says on it,

450
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:13.650
I'm better than you and there's a picture of a smiling.
Okay.

451
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.290
Do you will go out of your way to make sure that you get like a full spectrum of

452
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.260
amino acids?
So funny is like,

453
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:24.240
so once I went vegan instead of vegetarian,
I actually got healthier.

454
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:26.350
I started training more when I was just like a vegetarian.
Like,

455
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:30.010
I didn't really do much.
And when I ate meat I didn't do shit.
Um,

456
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.000
and I also smoked.
I also drank.
Uh,

457
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.370
and,
and then once I went Vegan,

458
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:38.440
that's when I actually started paying attention and stuff because you hear like,

459
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.660
oh,
are you gonna get your protein?
So you just start getting creative.

460
00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:42.970
And I never knew what fucking chemo was,
or Kale.

461
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:44.290
I never had more developed mushrooms.

462
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:46.180
And so I actually ended up eating much healthier,

463
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.620
wants to start thinking about my diet.
And I was like,

464
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:52.370
I train like six days a week now.
Um,
you know,
I mean,
and,
and,
and you look at the,

465
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:57.100
the UFC file,
by the way,
I don't get,
especially cause you always bring it up.

466
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.510
I get so nervous.

467
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.080
I never knew I was such an Errand Simpson fan until I found out he was a Vegan

468
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.150
and I was like,
you better fucking wind now.
Or every asshole on the underground.

469
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.240
You gotta you cow.
And uh,
yeah man.

470
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.630
I think it's really cool that like these really great fighters like Erin and

471
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:17.590
Fitch and you know,
uh,
or did it just for performance reasons.

472
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:21.140
I don't know about um,
Erin Simpson,
but the real issue with it,

473
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.030
it was actually ethical too,
which happened.
You never seen him act.

474
00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.540
Dan's like is a big proponent.

475
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.230
Diane Zinc is a brilliant guy and he's really smart.

476
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.240
He's a brilliant photographer as well.

477
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.600
Somebody just posted some of his stuff on the underground and I was watching it

478
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:37.250
yesterday.
Yeah,
man.
Looking at through as a clips.
It was,

479
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.200
photography's a fucking amazing,
he's a fan of the podcast too.

480
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.770
I'd love to have him on.
We're going to have him on.
He's great.
One.

481
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.590
Aaron's really fucking interesting to your man.

482
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:46.040
Where like I started following him on

483
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.640
<v 2>Twitter and like anyone being like a homophobe just calls the fuck out.</v>

484
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.990
<v 4>Yeah.
He seems like a really good day.
Very,
very friendly guy in real life too.</v>

485
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.740
Yeah,
for sure.
What I'm saying is when you're,
when you're,
especially in training,

486
00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.530
what it does is if you get all you,

487
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.390
if you get the full spectrum of amino acids into your body,

488
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.890
and I mean some people can't,

489
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:06.620
some people they feel like they just don't feel the same unless they have meat.

490
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.060
But you,
you can train all day long like that because it's so easy to break down.

491
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.900
Oh yeah.
And your recovery.
Yeah.
You can.

492
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.550
I recover a time like you're not digesting,
digesting food.

493
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:20.270
Like I fucking love meat.
All right.
I,
I love the shit out of some venison too.

494
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:24.260
I like,
I like animals that are fast and they get shot and then you eat them.

495
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.490
Those are the best ones.

496
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:27.980
I think the ones that run fast because you can taste the hope because they

497
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:31.850
almost got away.
No,
I think there's,
there's some,
some vibrance to them.
You know,

498
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:35.180
I think the reason why they run fast is because they're really nutritious.

499
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.610
It's fat slovenly animals and just kind of ponder wrong and you step up to them.

500
00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.060
She put a shotgun in their mouth,

501
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.480
they didn't even budge and blow their fucking brains out like a cow and he did

502
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.160
something good for you.

503
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.890
I think the animal that hears you and his ears are twitching,

504
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.390
there's a prize in his flesh,
you know,
that's an animal that's,
it's hard to get.

505
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.320
And I think evolution makes things that are difficult to get oftentimes worth

506
00:24:57.321 --> 00:25:00.050
getting.
Like fish.
Fish are fantastic for you.

507
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:02.090
And one of the reasons why they're fantastic for us because they're really

508
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:02.924
fucking hard to get

509
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.210
<v 2>I that you were saying and I think there's something to that.
I know.</v>

510
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.660
Do you ever just fantasize though?
Like,
like,
Hey,
I,
you know,

511
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.630
I'm just going to have a little filet to down man.
I mean it's like a,
it's like,

512
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.860
it's like anything where it's like you just developed new cravings.

513
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:17.440
It's like when you quit smoking and after 10 years you start to feel sick around

514
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:19.750
smoking.
You know what I mean?
I call faggotry

515
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.170
really?
Cause you only retire the word,
but I can put like Qa things at it.

516
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.160
Yeah.
I can say faggy.
I can say faggotry I,
but I can't say fag.

517
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:35.190
I can't call somebody.
But faggotry is a type of behavior that is nothing,

518
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.480
nothing to do with homosexual.
My new fairwinds it's,
it's a bag in the,

519
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.620
any around here.
You're tired of this.
Well,
write me about it.

520
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.710
So here,
here's why I retired.
It is,
um,
you know,
I always,

521
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.030
I obviously only used the word,
uh,
when I was chasing the packet,

522
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.300
scared gay people.
No,
I only,
I only use the word like ironically,

523
00:25:55.301 --> 00:25:57.490
like in the voice of the bad guy or whatever like that.

524
00:25:57.491 --> 00:26:01.330
Or even if I was telling like a story,
which even that I don't like doing,

525
00:26:01.331 --> 00:26:04.600
like if I was called it,
but it just happened plenty of times.

526
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:07.420
Everybody has is if you haven't been called a Faggot,
you're not living.
Right?

527
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.690
Yeah,
that's very true.
Taking some chances.

528
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.990
That's what it was called you a faggot at least once in your life.

529
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.460
What are you doing?
Doing everything perfect.
Buddha,
come on son.
So,
uh,

530
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.240
so what ended up happening was a,
ah,
so this is,
this prevents us fault.

531
00:26:22.241 --> 00:26:25.510
So it ended up happening was,
ah,
uh,
I'm still at my old bit.

532
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.730
I had this like old joke cause like,
I don't like the drug anymore,
but like,

533
00:26:27.731 --> 00:26:31.960
it was like just making fun of,
uh,
like Texas state motto.
And it said like,
um,

534
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.420
you know,
it's like,
uh,
what the fuck has it,
what's their motto?
It's a like,

535
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.150
don't mess with Texas,
right.
Instead of the joker,
again,

536
00:26:40.151 --> 00:26:41.890
this is one of the first year,
cause I wrote,
it was like,
you know,

537
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:45.690
that's the only state motto where with a motto is a threat.
And then I'm like,

538
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:48.000
if that's when they went with like,
imagine what they passed up on,
like,

539
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:50.130
and then it was just Texas,
you better back the fuck up faggot.

540
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.890
And there was like,
Hey,
he used the word.
And uh,

541
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.080
and what was so interesting was I'm like,
all right,
so I'm making fun of that.

542
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.640
Right?
You know,
that kind of,
and close on the fight,
right?

543
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.250
So then here's what happens.
So what happens is two things.
Number one,

544
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:05.610
I'm on stage,
uh,
at a shitty comedy club in New York and I'm bombing right?

545
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:08.100
It's just a bunch of people who were like super right wing,
they hate me.

546
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.110
So in my head I go,
not,
I'm going to do the Texas joke.
I go,

547
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:16.380
I'm going to get the Faggot joke right.
And this is like deep subconscious,

548
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:19.020
like when I'm like talking to don't really realize it did it til afterwards.

549
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.660
And sure enough,
I say the joke,
which is making fun of Texas,
right?

550
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:23.190
It's making fun of that mentality.

551
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.710
And they start laughing and they start laughing at the word.

552
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.260
They were laughing at the joke or the premise,
they just like that word.

553
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.560
And there is like as a comic,
I mean we can defend it all day by being like,

554
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:33.240
there's just a sound about the word and there is,

555
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:34.680
it's just that hard t at the end.

556
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.520
But then what happened was so much creepier is a,

557
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:41.520
is very nice woman who saw me in San Francisco.
Uh,
you know,

558
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:43.950
she tweets me and Facebook's meaning she's just a fan.

559
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.950
She emailed me one day and she goes,
uh,
you know,

560
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:50.370
my kid loves your CD and my kid listens to like you and Mitch Hedberg.

561
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:53.370
And I'm like,
that's pretty dope.
And like he's like,
he's young.
He's like,

562
00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:55.020
he's like 11 or 10 or something.

563
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.050
And you know the first email was really nice that he's going to science camp and

564
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.360
he's like really scared.
Can you write him a little email?
And I was like yeah,

565
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:02.370
totally.
I was like oh I hope there's more smart kids like you.

566
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:04.230
And I wrote this little email and I'm like I'm a good guy.

567
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.930
And then a couple of months later,
right before the green room,

568
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:10.920
cause she was there and Paul for some reason wanted me to do that joke cause I

569
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:13.740
was not much round white and he wanted me to like Bash Texas or whatever.

570
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.170
He goes,
uh,
she writes me and she goes,
uh,

571
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.140
you know my son can't come but he wanted me to send you this.
Uh,

572
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:26.460
him and his friends love your CD so much that uh,

573
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.640
they did one of your bits and the second she said they did one of your beds,

574
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.210
my heart fucking just sank.
And I'm like,
I know exactly what bit did it this is,

575
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.340
and I plug in my headphones cause I don't want my wife to hear the uh,

576
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.000
hate speech that's about to come leaping out at my computer.

577
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.350
And I just see a line of 12 year old boys and girls,

578
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.580
all San Francisco.

579
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:51.990
So just like the widest most like fucking area and looking kids all in unison.

580
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:56.670
You pet her back the fuck up faggot.
And I just like jumped on my computer.

581
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:58.080
I'm like,
you fucking get them right now.

582
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:00.480
You explained to them like the irony that I don't say that word anymore,

583
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:01.980
they blah blah blah.
And it's like,

584
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.880
don't tell me that they don't think that word is now part of a,
you know,

585
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:09.110
an okay vernacular.
They're not going to start hate crimes but and you know,

586
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:09.531
<v 1>right.</v>

587
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:13.310
But they're 12 there 12 it would have been an awesome example if there's 30 year

588
00:29:13.311 --> 00:29:16.280
olds and you change their minds,
but for 12 year olds,
yeah,

589
00:29:16.281 --> 00:29:18.860
of course they're going to like react to that.
It's not for them.

590
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.910
The bits not for them.

591
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.570
Of course you believe that there's nothing wrong with that bit,
you know,

592
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:28.460
and for you to have that bit used in a way that is not what what you were,

593
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.090
that's like leaving a hammer around and someone throws it through a car window.

594
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.830
Sure.
No,
yeah,
it is ridiculous that,
you know,
you left the hammer around but,
but,

595
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.050
but it's not,
but it's supposed to be for everybody but a gay person's window.

596
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.130
Yeah.
And then it's sad.
Well,
you know my problem,
I had

597
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.940
<v 3>an issue with it.
I called my dog a faggot and I called some ants,</v>

598
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:49.390
a faggot and my spike TV special.
But it's not,
I don't mean he's gay.

599
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.460
It was a bit about the talking dog pod commercial.

600
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.050
My bit was like,

601
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.290
you know how mad you would be if you told your dog you loved him every day and

602
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:02.500
he didn't say shit until all the sudden he's like,
wish you wouldn't smoke pot.

603
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:07.660
You can fucking talk the whole time around.
Yeah.
Oh,
I mean we never,
yeah.

604
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.900
I mean when I said it,
we never call.
I mean,
my wife one day I was like,
wait,

605
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:14.380
when we still worked like day job,
she was like,
uh,
today somehow,

606
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:18.070
I don't know how you did it,
but you manage to call a baby and the sky a faggot.

607
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.800
It's funny though,
like,
and yeah,
obviously there is no connotation,
but you know,

608
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:27.520
just like people who listen to your podcast,
just like,
uh,
you know,
fuck it.

609
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.480
And 12 year old kids,

610
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:31.720
it's like you just don't want to be the dude who throws it out there because

611
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:32.201
look,
I mean,

612
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:36.350
there were kids at 12 year old at 12 years old that know they're gay that were

613
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.600
tossed around.

614
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.720
I wish you could just throw it around in front of gay people and I wish they get

615
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.150
thrown around in front of you.
A lot.
Great word.
If you,

616
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:46.000
if you didn't have any hate in your heart.
Well,
and that's the problem a lot too.

617
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:47.920
I mean,
Alison and I,
when we first moved in together,

618
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:50.050
we had two gay roommates and like we used to throw the,

619
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:53.080
that was when that was at the,
at the peak of our use of the word.

620
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.810
But when I was explained the whole thing about the spike thing,

621
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.270
I was explained by a gay guy who was a,

622
00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.300
an executive for a company that I will not name,

623
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.810
but he was a gay guy and he was telling me that I couldn't say it because it's

624
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:07.690
their word,
right?
He goes,
it's our word,
it's our nigger.

625
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.600
He really said it's our nigger where you just like,
you know,

626
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:12.590
you can't say that word because that's not yours.

627
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.040
I told him that that was the gay shit I've ever heard in my life.

628
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:18.160
Then he can go fuck himself and it's like,
it's a joke in my act about it,

629
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:20.920
but it really I,
that is exactly what happened,
man.

630
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.620
He literally said that and I literally said that like,
you can go for,

631
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:25.660
that's the gay shit I've ever heard.
Like that's ridiculous.

632
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.470
I can't have a word all of yourself and buy.

633
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.300
Why does everybody want to connect everything to nigger?

634
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.480
Why can't it just be a bad word?
Why does it have to be,
oh,

635
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:38.860
that's the Filipino nigger.
What the fuck?

636
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.740
Why does everybody have to do that?
Is it,
is it that ridiculous?

637
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.200
We can't figure it out any other way.
You have to say.

638
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.980
The only way I know it's bad is if you say it's your nigger.
Oh it's the,

639
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:50.020
that's what fag it is.
It's your nigger.

640
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.530
I didn't know know Louis C K has that really great bit about it too.

641
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:56.240
About the n word or just like you just made me think of the real word.
Right.

642
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.440
That's so funny.
Yeah,
it's true.
But it's tough.
It's really tough man.

643
00:31:59.441 --> 00:32:04.120
Because it's like a lot of times like it's,
it's,

644
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.180
it's hard leaving comedy or irony in the hands of people who don't know how to

645
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:13.480
use it.
It's true.
You know what I mean?
And what always scared me.

646
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:16.210
Especially cause I talk about like gay rights a lot and like,
you know,

647
00:32:16.211 --> 00:32:18.650
I'm filthy,
it's not like a prude thing.
I'm,
you know,

648
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.850
using cock sucker and stuff like that.
The only fear I would have is like,

649
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.900
I mean there are people that get legitimate like trigger kind of like almost

650
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:28.040
post traumatic check.
I mean if there was just a war,

651
00:32:28.041 --> 00:32:30.970
if you just got the shit kicked out of every day for like your sexuality,

652
00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:34.740
which at the time you're young enough not to even know if it's,
if,

653
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.640
if all the people were true,
if you really are broken,

654
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:39.410
if you're doing something wrong,
if you really should like women,
you know,

655
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.244
vice versa.

656
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.590
And that was just the word you heard and you got the shit beat out of you.

657
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:44.720
And then you hear someone who's like sticking up for you.
You know,

658
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:46.490
you're obviously pro gay rights,
you don't give a shit,

659
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.520
but then you just hear that word.
You still just get that kind of like,
ah,

660
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.850
I'm still,
he still didn't have my back,
you know what I mean?
And uh,

661
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.900
and that's just like a risk,

662
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.910
especially when like I've come up with so many grosser things to fucking say

663
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.800
when I'd just like,
all right,
don't use that word.

664
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.120
Just see something else you can do.

665
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:05.930
You can come up with just filth if you just aren't putting weird fucking word

666
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.170
combinations together and stuff like that.
It's more fun,
you know?
Yeah.

667
00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:11.990
Sometimes though,
but sometimes faggots the right word for the job.

668
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:18.170
That's what's unfortunate is I ultimately decided that it was ineffective

669
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.260
because it wasn't conveying what you're trying to convey.

670
00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.450
That's what I ultimately found.
So many people got upset at me for using it.

671
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.140
I'm like,
you're not conveying a,
you're not perceiving what I'm trying to convey.

672
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.650
So it's an ineffective word.
Unfortunately.
I think it's a great word,

673
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:37.400
but it's ineffective,
you know?
I certainly don't mean homophobic in any way.

674
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:38.450
Stretch or form.

675
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:41.390
I think you're born gay and if you don't think someone's born gay,

676
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.630
it's because you know when you're born retarded or,

677
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.390
or your Michele Bachmann's husband.
Oh Wow.

678
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.680
That motherfucker that is going to end with bodies of dead babies.

679
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.180
He killed whole shit.
Dave Foley sent me hip to this guy.
Thank you,
Mr. Foley.

680
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.180
Oh Wow.
Dave Foley,
who's tweeting about how gay,
um,

681
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.740
Marcus Bachmann is and you think that can't be that.
I'm like,

682
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.120
how could he be?
I'm like,
come on,
Dave.
You.
Yeah.

683
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.560
What did he hit on your girlfriend or something like that and what's going on

684
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:13.910
here,
Dave?
You know,
I go to the link to Dave put up and I went,

685
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.410
oh my God,
these guys need to stop.
Dude.

686
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.550
He is so gay.
He's calling them barbarians.
I mean,
it sounds like Paul Lynn,

687
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.220
I know he sounds like one of the squares and the Hollywood squares.

688
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:28.190
It states left even barbarians,
sweaty,

689
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.850
muscular barbarian with soar fat Cox.

690
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.000
It's just what is that is going on there?
I know.
Crazy as that Sam's caps,
man,

691
00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:38.420
it's such a sick of movement where they say,

692
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.020
I hope like all of those kids that go to those like anti camps just come back

693
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:44.990
with so many phone numbers.
Like I hope that's just like,
I hope those four,

694
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:47.270
that forests or certain things like a gay fuck faster,

695
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.430
there's just so much fucking,
like the trees are ashamed of their,
like,

696
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.110
I shouldn't look at this.
Totally slice is supposed to be magical.

697
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.750
Park went the other way.
I don't know if you saw that.

698
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:59.300
It was just all these kids just fucking shooting themselves.
Oh.
They're like,

699
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:02.600
all right,
see you later.
And you just hear like wonder if they wouldn't let,

700
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:05.390
so I guess South Park kind of gets a free reign.
They can do whatever they want.

701
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:10.220
Yeah.
Oh,
I mean,
this was fucking kids fucking each other to what?
Ellie,

702
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.800
can you have a cartoon kids fuck each other.
And then I allow that.

703
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.950
I saw Carmen does deck.
Yeah.
I think when you,
when you're making that much money,

704
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:18.290
people were like,
I don't give a shit with comedy central.
Just,
I mean,

705
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.390
they're never really regulated by the FCC.

706
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.590
I don't know how their cable cable is not regulated by the FCC.

707
00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:27.800
Cabled technically can do whatever the fuck they want just because they have

708
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.320
commercials,
which means they're just regular cable.

709
00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:32.540
They're not subscription cable like HBO.
Right.

710
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:34.460
They can do whatever the fuck they want.
My,

711
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.380
that's one of the things I was going to say about my special,

712
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:41.410
they allowed after 11 on Spike TV and on comedy central after 11:00 PM the aired

713
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:45.510
at night.
All the words are in fuck,
except faggot.

714
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.540
And you're saying they wouldn't let that one at?
Yeah.
Where do you live?

715
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.170
I Brooklyn.
Brooklyn.
Hard Keegan in Brooklyn now man.

716
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.760
We have like Vegan pizza delivery places and Chinese food and like we take

717
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:59.560
whenever my wife's parents come in and they get like chicken parm sandwiches and

718
00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:02.400
like cheesecake and shit and like they don't taste the fucking difference.

719
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.250
So you said something that was very important at the beginning we were talking

720
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:08.070
about honey and that you are a pro,

721
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:13.100
you use honey has some vegans that don't want even bees work and for that how it

722
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.330
is ridiculous.
You're not like super hardcore.
Do you do soy?
These are cons.
Uh,

723
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.630
yeah,
I yeah,
I will do.

724
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:21.480
So I don't do it that much just cause it's like processed and like I'm like I'm

725
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.490
going to go vegan.
I want to be like healthier.
You know?

726
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:25.830
Especially since I started like fighting,
I'm like a lot more,

727
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.770
you didn't want to cry while doing Jujitsu and I didn't want to say estrogen and

728
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.390
stuff like that.
[inaudible] had a mama is in a meeting,
he starts making milk.

729
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.540
We had Dick Gregory on our show on Monday.
Right.

730
00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:39.300
And he's like this fascinating dude who you want to talk to you because of all

731
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:41.590
of his stances,
you know,
uh,
uh,
I can see,
you know,

732
00:36:41.591 --> 00:36:43.830
and he's the one who pulled out the Zapruder film.

733
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.370
Did Gregory brought the Zapruder film to the Geraldo Rivera Show?

734
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.710
I did many years.
Holy Shit.
I didn't know the history.
That was fascinating.

735
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:52.740
I mean,
this guy's made his,

736
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:55.890
I mean he marched with Martin Luther King Jr he was the first black comic to

737
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:59.500
play an all white nightclub because you have no higher him.
Right.
Uh,

738
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.620
but he's also 80 years old and like Jordan.

739
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.550
So we're just asking like a simple question where it's just like,
oh,

740
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:09.330
how do you feel about the death penalty was like my grandkids.
Soy makes you gay.

741
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:11.940
And like,
it just like kind of trailed all over the place.
But yeah,

742
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:16.650
he brought that up,
uh,
on Monday.
I think he might be a Kim trail guy too.
Yeah,

743
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.830
I mean I,
I was really big into soy soil.
Then I switched up on in,

744
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:21.090
but when I was in the soil,

745
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:25.440
I could totally feel like I was just really emotional.
I never really felt it.

746
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.780
I just assumed,
I just assumed it was because I was a comic.
I'm like,
God,

747
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.500
I have hated myself pre soy,
but all my milks,
the shit.
Yeah.

748
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.770
The soil.
There's been like research lately about saying like all this evidence,

749
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:41.780
like it's bad for asthma,
lies soil.
Yeah.

750
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.680
And like how there's like babies,

751
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:47.200
it's supposedly like there's reports lately and I you shouldn't give baby soy

752
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.910
that there's some bad shit going on somewhere in the middle.
I mean,

753
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:52.920
any process for,
it's pretty bad.
That's why I love,

754
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.530
it's like you switched from regular milk to soy milk to almond milk and you look

755
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:57.780
at the ingredients and I was like all mince.
And I was like,
yeah,

756
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.720
that's what you want.
You know what I mean?
Like whenever,
uh,

757
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.330
whenever you do a sub,
it's like,
that's what's cool about the Vegan subs.

758
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.350
It's like,
so,
so milk's not really great for you.
Right.
Um,

759
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.540
especially if you're not getting,
you know,
it's pasta and antibiotics.

760
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:12.990
And fucking,
you know,
it's used to fatten up calves like we're not supposed to.

761
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.260
We're the only animal that drinks out of a tit,
a past infancy,

762
00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:19.740
let alone not even our tip.
Another tip.
But you know what?
With cookies,

763
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:23.460
it's the shit son.
But you stop getting silly.
You can start saying,

764
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.030
you know what else you can use raw milk.
That's what I get.

765
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.980
I get it from whole foods.
It's only good.
It seems like it was worse.
Dangerous,

766
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:36.250
but
it's like fucking bare back.
All right.

767
00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:37.780
Sometimes you get to take a chance on,

768
00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:39.580
you know you want to live with a condom you whole life.

769
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.240
So I drink raw milk when I have my vegan cookies cause I will eat the fuck out

770
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:46.240
of some vegan cookies.
I don't know what makes them Vegan,
but they're good.

771
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.800
They're gonna just help me out with chocolate chips.

772
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.200
I did the opposite of a Vegan Diet this weekend.

773
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.890
I was at a hotel that the only thing close to it wasn't Mcdonald's and a seven

774
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:57.430
11 so I had only at those two places where this was in Montana,

775
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.190
which is so crazy.
This should be eaten.
Bear burgers up there.

776
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.730
I know you're in Montana.
You can get shitty process food.
That was probably,

777
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.100
you know,
have you been there before,
Montana?
Yeah,

778
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.900
I think I was there when I was young,
but I haven't been there in my adult life.

779
00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:12.850
Do you ever murder somebody or kidnap somebody?
Go to Montana.

780
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.460
It's a great place to just hide and live your life.

781
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.870
Or Dane had a great episode on Montana Authors,
authors that live up in Montana.

782
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:22.240
It was hanging out with them and they were eating wild game and shit and like

783
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:26.560
shooting pheasants and stuff.
My Buddy Steve,
Steve Graham,
he lived in Montana.

784
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.430
He lived up there for a long time.
He was,
um,
a doctor up there.
It's on his face.

785
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.800
It's like Alison Anhydro after.

786
00:39:31.801 --> 00:39:34.390
I'm actually thought of one of your bits because one of those places where like,

787
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.730
especially if you're used to la or New York or city,

788
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:38.760
as you drive through a place like Montana or your drive through,

789
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.570
like kind of up above like San Francisco,

790
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:42.460
but I live in mill valley or somewhere were you can just see these fucking

791
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.280
mountains and it reminds you that like,
oh,
I'm on earth.
Like I'm on a plane.

792
00:39:46.281 --> 00:39:48.950
I'm not like on another fucking highway.
I'm not another fucking best by,

793
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:49.751
but you strip my,

794
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:54.190
like I'm on a planet because you just see what it almost looked like before we

795
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.990
fucking strip mall it all up.
You know?
And when I was living in Boulder,
I will,

796
00:39:57.991 --> 00:39:58.960
I was up in the mountains.

797
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.040
One of the reasons why I chose to go up in the mountains,
because the stars,

798
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.680
because what you could see at night to me,
I was like,
look,

799
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:08.300
people pay a lot of money for artwork.
You know,

800
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.320
on the wall there's no greater artwork then nature,

801
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.260
then looking at mountains and then at nighttime stars.
Yeah,

802
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:18.430
I mean you see 10 times more stars [inaudible] here because of all the light

803
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:22.200
pollution that we experienced.
The Sky was amazing,
the stars.

804
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.080
But what was even cooler was how far you could see distance wise.

805
00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:29.650
Like you don't like in La,
you don't realize that.
You can't really see that far.

806
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:33.060
Most of the time range smoggy.
This you could see miles,

807
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.270
like we saw a storm coming,
like just a black class.

808
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.650
Like it was so cool and it was just a little storm and that went away and was

809
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:45.120
like,
wow,
that's,
and you can hear shit.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

810
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.890
just here when I was quiet,
when I was up in Colorado,

811
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:52.891
it was sitting on the porch for fucking hours and just hear like eagles here,

812
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.540
squawk Golden Eagles up there.

813
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.260
You would hear all sorts of weird animals going through the woods at night.

814
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.950
He got a little creepy,
especially after the dog had eaten by a mountain line.

815
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.970
It'll go a little creepy but drink.
But,
um,
but during the day it was,

816
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.100
but you would every day I would see like a porcupine,
like a fucking pig,

817
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.180
porcupine in the middle of the road and have to wait for this fucking thing and

818
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:17.110
see deer constantly.
A buddy of mine just was biking and he just,

819
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:21.550
he's in boulder and he ran into a Mousse or riding his bike.
Holy Shit,

820
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:22.370
that's a moose.

821
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:26.530
I can go to places like that and you start to think about like our ancestors and

822
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:27.690
stuff and like the things we complain about,

823
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:32.110
it's like people hiked across this with like dying relatives strapped to their

824
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:35.540
back and like searching for wildlife.
That's insane.

825
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.600
I think it's so important to go to a place like that and sit the fuck down and

826
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:44.720
just,
just reset your brain.
Reset the way you look at civilization.

827
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.210
For me live in the mountains was so perfect because it was only 20 minutes of

828
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:52.130
boulder.
So in 20 minutes I could get down to the city.
But then I was in,

829
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:57.230
I was in the woods,
man.
You get to a view of the earth as you were saying.

830
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.990
It's like,
it really lets you put everything in perspective.

831
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:02.480
Just because there's a giant mass of people down there,

832
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:06.460
ball buzzing around in a hive doesn't mean you have to be in that totally right.

833
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.180
Everyone you've got to boulder,
that's a pretty big show.

834
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.240
Hippie think made out of co ops and shit.
Yeah,
Boulder's awesome.

835
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.420
Except for this too many headpiece.
Boulder killed my view of hippies.

836
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.760
I had a very um,
sort of,
uh,

837
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.760
idealistic view of hippies,
fortunate boulder in boulder.
They broke me.

838
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.400
It broke me with all their,
their constant requests for things.

839
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:28.250
It's brutal and they take it like wine hippie step two,
you're far.

840
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:31.220
So like they were trespassing on my property and I'm like,
hey man,

841
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:33.020
we can't walk in your drug.
This is all land.

842
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.930
That's the thing when like even with like simple things,

843
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:38.270
like there was something like amazing Vegan places.
Like I said,

844
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:40.910
well let's take our family or our friends too when we're in New York.

845
00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.130
But then like it be traveling and like sometimes again,

846
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.750
it's just one step too fucking hippie man.

847
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.280
You got there and it's like we don't believe it's silverware man.

848
00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:50.870
I was like God damn it.
Come on man.
Like he really had to fucking do that.

849
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:54.590
Or you know sometimes I think of liberals had the the um,

850
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:59.600
and especially hippies if they had the drive of Republicans would fucking win.

851
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.380
Cause sometimes I'll go to something where it's like such a good cause like the

852
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.470
Brooklyn Book Fair or like saying like no one knows we're fucking shit is like,

853
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:09.140
you know,
or you go to like a protest.
Like people have the wrong sign.

854
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:12.710
It's like if I can get free to bed or,
and it's like,
no,
you're not even fucking,

855
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.380
that's the wrong one.
You know what I mean?
It's not even that.

856
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.260
And then you look at,
Republicans are on the same page every fucking day.

857
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:19.850
There's no infighting,
there's no bullshit.

858
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:21.260
The environmentalist are mad at the vegans are,

859
00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:24.410
the gays are mad at the blacks or whatever.
You just get like 100%.

860
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:26.720
They wake up at like 6:00 AM and they were like,
Hey,
are you crazy?

861
00:43:26.721 --> 00:43:28.320
It's like you are you crazy?
You have like,
it's all right,

862
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.360
it's a fucking go be crazy.

863
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:31.910
And then they go and they get shit done because what they like,

864
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.300
what they lack and sort of empathy and facts,
uh,

865
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.600
they make up for in like pamphlet making skills and they're really good at that.

866
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.480
She had organization,

867
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.710
an organization that really get a lobbying and we're just like trespassing on

868
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:44.870
your work and his properties like,
hey,
freedom.

869
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.190
Do you remember the people that were hired or volunteered when the,
uh,

870
00:43:49.191 --> 00:43:51.920
the voting scandal that was going down in Florida and all the people that were

871
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:54.460
cheering and throwing their fists up in the nab,

872
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.600
like your around shirts and shit.
It was so creepy.
That was the creepy,

873
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.450
that's one thing that I totally agree with you on that,

874
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.090
that particular situation.
I would never see Democrats doing that exact same old,

875
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.100
I mean,
we'll look at with Democrats,
look at Barack Obama.
I mean,

876
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:10.310
look at what a gigantic,
gigantic,

877
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:15.440
a scared little vagina he's been where he's talking about,
uh,

878
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.370
talking about compromise.

879
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:18.530
It's always talking about that the country wants to stay in office.

880
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.560
The country want to compromise.
The country one compromise.

881
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.400
But here's the ironic part.
So what ends up happening,

882
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.300
he compromises and sells out the liberals,
right?
He compromises before.

883
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.770
There's even like a debate,
like if you're arguing,
if there are 35 hostages,

884
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:32.340
right?
And Obama's like negotiating,

885
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:35.070
you're going to end with like 38 dead hostages and abortion is going to be

886
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.491
illegal.

887
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:39.480
Like that's literally like disguise the way he fuckin operates because he,
he,

888
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:41.850
he will give them what they want before the debate even starts,
right?

889
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:46.020
So you're already setting the line to the right instead of how you're supposed

890
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:50.760
to debate,
ask for a lot,
then start compromising down.
Right?
And the reason,
uh,

891
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.060
Eh,
oh,
so he's doing that because he's saying,
you know,
we're,
we're,
we're,

892
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:56.850
we're in a tough economic time.
The Republicans are going to blah,
blah,
blah.

893
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.950
The bottom line is the Republicans on record,

894
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:01.740
on meet the press on every show have said their only goal is to get Obama out of

895
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:05.850
office.
So if they're going to do everything they can to fuck you anyway,

896
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.670
why not get what you want unless it's really not what you want.

897
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.990
And that's when I started to think there's more kind of in a clear way,

898
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.380
I don't think it works that way.

899
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:17.160
I don't think there's really two United groups or think there's all sorts of

900
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.560
factions inside each particular group.

901
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:23.760
The Tea Party faction of the faction that actually believed that Sarah Pailin

902
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.940
could be fucking president and they have to mingle in with the rest of these

903
00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:30.120
factions.
You know,
the pro war factions,
the industrials factions,

904
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.810
they all get together and then own little group and try to keep things as civil

905
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.200
as possible and keep things moving in the same direction.
But I don't,

906
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.830
I don't really think they're all organized.
I don't think that,
you know,

907
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:43.150
I don't think they've completely saw the,
the,

908
00:45:43.151 --> 00:45:45.720
the whole picture together and agreed on it.
No,
no.

909
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.330
I mean I definitely don't think it's like the smoky room thing,

910
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:51.240
but I do think it's that there would be awesome though.

911
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:54.480
It would be the bill Hicks joke about the Kennedy assassination definitely

912
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:57.870
explain a lot.
Cause if you don't know how this great joke about when he,

913
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.070
when would someone become president?
They bring you into a dark smokey room,

914
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:05.970
filled with cigar smoking industrialists of Industry,
roll the clip,

915
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.290
and then it shows you a,

916
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:10.620
an angle of the President Kennedy assassination that you've never seen before.

917
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.030
And then afterwards it goes,
any questions?
Just what my agenda is going to be.

918
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.170
Yeah.
I mean there's definitely somebody that theory,
but Obama,
I mean,
come on.

919
00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:19.891
Is that,
is there,

920
00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:23.610
is there ever been a bigger turnaround between what you promise in going into

921
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:26.790
office in which actually deliver?
Has there ever been a,
I don't know,

922
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:31.260
ever seen a guy that seemed to be a liberal that became a bush.

923
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.990
This is pretty bad.
I mean we'll,
Clinton was a lot more republican than people.

924
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.171
I mean,

925
00:46:34.171 --> 00:46:37.050
you remember the most homophobic legislation was passed in our cloud and all

926
00:46:37.051 --> 00:46:39.270
that telecomm merging that was under Clinton.

927
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.440
What is the homophobic stuff that was passed on to the defense of Marriage Act,

928
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.590
which now Obama shiner the officer.
Where does that come from is well,

929
00:46:47.591 --> 00:46:50.740
who's putting the pressure?
That's what I don't understand.
Why would,
why,

930
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.200
what is the pressure to make gay marriage illegal?
Where's that coming from?

931
00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:59.850
Zero financial benefit in that the insurance company thing,
the religious right.

932
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.110
I mean is it just that though?

933
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:03.030
Cause it seems like there's gotta be some money in that.

934
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.360
It seems like if in order for it to have so many legs it's,

935
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.430
there's gotta be some money,
you know,
actually care so much.

936
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.550
I kind of wish there was cause ward,
a lot of that stuff can come down to money.

937
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.670
This is legitimately like fucking racism wise.

938
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:17.550
I mean it's just like it was the next step.
We're all scared.

939
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:18.690
We need someone to fucking hate.

940
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:22.440
We need someone to scapegoat because look what's easier saying,
ah,

941
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:23.270
we have to the,

942
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.640
the entire voting systems rigged or democracy might be broken if you try to fix

943
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.770
it,
are going to be chased down by a bunch of fucking brown shirts.

944
00:47:28.771 --> 00:47:30.160
So we to completely

945
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.700
<v 4>redo our voting system or blame it on the Mexicans,
blame it on the gaze,</v>

946
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.960
blame it on the poor black women.

947
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.200
It's really easy to scapegoat these people and paint them as like the big

948
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:41.620
problem or eat mushrooms and wait for the aliens.

949
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.770
That's what I'm gonna do.
Sort everything out.

950
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.650
I don't want to be a part of this civilization anymore.
It's pretty bad.

951
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.800
I'm 43 years old.
42 that's what I'm saying.

952
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.200
I'm not getting into the point where I'm going.
You know what?

953
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:56.930
You guys are just too crazy and it's been crazy since the 60s it's been crazy

954
00:47:56.931 --> 00:48:01.931
since the 50s I listened to a hunters Thompson speech that he gave at Boulder,

955
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:06.430
a university in the 1970s and I listened to it the other day on the plane and

956
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:10.030
when I was listening to that I was like,
wow,
these are the same fucking concerns.

957
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:13.930
They were worried about the CFR.
They were worried about,
you know,
the,
you know,

958
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:14.681
the end of the world.

959
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:18.200
People were worried back then about a war with the Soviet Union and like me and

960
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.630
you know,
all this country's going down hill.
This country's going down hill,

961
00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:24.100
me and that was the echoed statement over and over again in the 1970s then here

962
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:27.640
we are,
2011 things just keep fucking putting along,
man.

963
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:29.830
I don't,

964
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.400
I don't want to keep trying to fix this fucking thing and wait my whole life
out.

965
00:48:33.401 --> 00:48:35.200
That's my number one problem with politics.

966
00:48:35.201 --> 00:48:40.120
Now I don't want to waste my whole life on some system that I had no say over.

967
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:44.440
All of a sudden I'm born into this system that in my opinion makes very little

968
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:45.220
fucking sense.

969
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.300
Seems like it's overrun with douchebags and corruption and there's no ethical

970
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:51.600
way through.
So I look at him and go,
what?
What,
what?

971
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:52.770
How much time am I going to waste?

972
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.980
Can I just make some noise in the background and hope they don't get so out of

973
00:48:56.981 --> 00:48:59.140
control that I have to deal with them in my life?
I mean,

974
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:02.480
is that my option now wait in man,
I'm not getting,

975
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:05.680
I'm not going in there and you don't want it.
But the problem is it's like,

976
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:07.870
and you can look at it from kind of like a bad ass point of view.

977
00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:10.090
It's like you look at like these activists,
there was this kid,

978
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:11.940
<v 2>oh,
there's this guy named Tim to Christopher.</v>

979
00:49:11.941 --> 00:49:13.680
And of course you got like no mainstream media attention,

980
00:49:13.681 --> 00:49:15.990
even though he was like a likable,
articulate,
funny,

981
00:49:15.991 --> 00:49:19.140
like good looking dude where they were going to auction off all of this land.

982
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:25.340
<v 4>He was,
he was really drew me to have a good smile,</v>

983
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.690
like a vampire.
Oh,
I'm drinking soy milk.
I'm sorry everybody.
I apologize.
Um,

984
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.310
and he,
yeah.

985
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.800
<v 2>Uh,
he,
uh,</v>

986
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.130
they were gonna auction off of the Bush administration was an auction off all

987
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.250
this,
like a protected wildlife and Utah.
Right.

988
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.850
And so,
you know,
Robert Redford trying to stop it and all this stuff,

989
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:47.080
no one can stop it and they're doing it to drill and this is just like this

990
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:50.860
amazing land that hasn't been touched.
Um,
and so Tinder,

991
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:54.850
Christopher's fucking driving to school and he's like,
I have to do something.

992
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:57.430
This is insane.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Maybe I'll just purchase,

993
00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.960
assign is stupid,
but I have to try it.

994
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.220
So he goes there and notices there's little security and they're letting people

995
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:04.900
in for the auction and he's just like,

996
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.040
I'm going to go and I'm gonna go in an auction.
Right?
So he goes in,

997
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.070
no one's really noticing him.
It's like he's probably like the only guy,

998
00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:16.060
not in a cowboy hat.
But,
uh,
at least that's how I envisioned it.
And he,
uh,

999
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.160
he helped bids all these oil companies.

1000
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.360
He's just keeps bidding and bidding 100,000,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1001
00:50:20.361 --> 00:50:24.970
like buys all the land.
Right?
So they realize he's a fake.
He gets arrested.

1002
00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.000
What he knew was by the time they restructured everything cause they can't just

1003
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:32.720
do the auction again.
Uh,
Obama was going to be an office and Obama,
uh,

1004
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.510
would protect the land.
So it's a really cool,
sort of heroic,

1005
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:38.000
Badass story about activism and about actually changing something.

1006
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:41.360
But the twist is a,
he just got sentenced.
He's going to fucking jail.

1007
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:46.160
So the people who tortured the people who wire tap,
the people who you know,
uh,

1008
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.301
kill civilians,

1009
00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:51.890
the government that will cut $900 million from the school system in Pennsylvania

1010
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.250
will not tax cut giving tax cuts to billionaires.
Those guys are fine.

1011
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.480
But this dude who just like,
it was a fucking t.
I mean that was that,

1012
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.090
that was old school civil disobedience.
I mean,

1013
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:03.950
the thing is it wasn't a fucking online petition.

1014
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:08.360
It wasn't like you retweeted something.
Fuck Shit Up Moses Physical Act.

1015
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.870
Well he,
I guess it was,
it was fraud.
He was posing as,

1016
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:14.840
or I don't know the actual charge,
but he was posing to someone else.

1017
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:19.730
He disrupted this,
uh,
this auction.
Um,
I don't,
I don't know the name of the game.

1018
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:24.500
He went in there and fucking raised his little stupid auction and paddle and

1019
00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:26.780
just kept raising it and just lied and fucked up the whole thing.

1020
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:30.740
So He'd lost people money and he's going to jail for the,
yeah,
I think it was a,

1021
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:32.750
I think the sentence might have been like 10 years.

1022
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.580
<v 1>Speaking of Montana,
giant fucking oil spill in Montana.</v>

1023
00:51:35.581 --> 00:51:37.500
Have you seen the photos of that?
It's horrible.

1024
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.750
Right into the fucking Yellowstone river man.

1025
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:45.320
At least 25 miles between 31 and 42,000 gallons float.

1026
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.400
It's a lot of flooding then.

1027
00:51:47.401 --> 00:51:50.370
So that's what they were talking about is how everything's flooding right now.

1028
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.600
This is not flooding.
Let her know this is oil and the oil spill.

1029
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.220
It's horrible man.

1030
00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:01.370
This beautiful river and it is just fucking disgusting with oil.

1031
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.300
It's so sad man.
If you ever go up to like you know that you were up in Montana,

1032
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.780
you know you go to that part of the world like looking at like some of the,

1033
00:52:08.781 --> 00:52:10.740
the the rivers and lakes and streams,

1034
00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:14.850
the flow through like Colorado and Wyoming and all those like a sparsely

1035
00:52:14.851 --> 00:52:16.050
populated places.

1036
00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.270
There's a few places like that where you can still see some incredible,
you know,

1037
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.580
natural,
beautiful things like that and now it's fucked.

1038
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:24.850
<v 2>Now you probably have a lot of,</v>

1039
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.820
you probably have at least some listeners who were like,
you know,
who cares,

1040
00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:29.950
we've got to get the oil,
blah blah blah blah,
blah,
like,
or something.

1041
00:52:29.951 --> 00:52:32.620
It looks pretty.
Go look on a,
at a,
at a,
at a pretty picture,

1042
00:52:32.621 --> 00:52:35.770
but people's waters or be employed water is being poisoned.

1043
00:52:35.771 --> 00:52:37.870
If you've seen that shit in New York where people come to light their water on

1044
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:40.570
fire.
Yes.
Because of the hydro fracking like insane.

1045
00:52:40.571 --> 00:52:44.850
Like people were literally being like poisoned by this shit just for more for

1046
00:52:44.851 --> 00:52:45.700
four fucking money.

1047
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:46.201
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:52:46.201 --> 00:52:50.610
Well the idea that the only way to go is with oil and the only way to go as a

1049
00:52:50.611 --> 00:52:52.770
way that pollutes the environment.
That's ridiculous.
There's,

1050
00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:54.690
they found clean sources of fuel.

1051
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:59.340
What they need to do is figure out a way to make clean sources of fuel work for

1052
00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:02.070
a large scale of human beings.
That's what they need to do.

1053
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.350
<v 2>Bill Burr had to jack about it.
I never saw him do it.
I'm like,</v>

1054
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:08.140
TV Buy America was working it out of the Boston comedy club when I was starting

1055
00:53:08.141 --> 00:53:12.150
in about like somewhere there's like some guy on a farm who like invented like

1056
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.590
the perfect like you know,

1057
00:53:13.591 --> 00:53:16.920
kind of a electric car or like natural gas and you know,

1058
00:53:16.921 --> 00:53:18.330
people come to his door and they're like,
yeah,

1059
00:53:18.331 --> 00:53:21.540
we're here from a like whatever committee and they're like,

1060
00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:22.590
let's just see the thing.

1061
00:53:22.591 --> 00:53:25.380
And then he turned around like it's right here and just funk and just take some

1062
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:26.010
out.
Just

1063
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.750
<v 3>drags him away and like that's it.
You know?</v>

1064
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:30.390
I know there was a guy that invented a car that room water.

1065
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.370
It turned up dead a couple of years later.

1066
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.470
They were talking about that on the opiod Anthony show.

1067
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:38.550
That's probably where you were talking about were bill Burke came problems on

1068
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:42.060
that episode.
You don't want to be,
you don't want to be conspiratorial sometimes,

1069
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:44.450
but here they were from artilect when you were talking about the fucking whistle

1070
00:53:44.451 --> 00:53:47.860
blowers dead dead and you hear stuff like that and it's just like,
all right,

1071
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:52.050
Jesus,
look,
you don't know.
The strange case of Vince Foster,

1072
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:54.620
you know the Vince Foster story,
right?
Oh,
he had a clean beds.

1073
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.190
Foster Vince Foster,

1074
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:59.970
some guy who knew a lot of shit about all those creepy real estate deals that

1075
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:02.970
went on where a lot of people went to jail and this guy wound up in a fucking,

1076
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.150
uh,
he was one of dead where there was no blood,

1077
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.960
there was no blood near the scene of the crime.

1078
00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:11.760
The clearly moved his body and the gun was still in his hand,

1079
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.050
which is not supposed to ever happen in a suicide case.
When you shoot yourself,

1080
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.610
your gun supposedly just goes flying out of your hand.
You can't hold onto it.

1081
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.000
Right?
So when someone's got a gun in their hand and there's no blood there,

1082
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:27.870
like I'm pretty sure that's a,
don't quote me on this.
I've read the book,

1083
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.720
the strange case of Vince Foster,
the strange death of visit the foster,

1084
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:33.840
I read it years ago for sure.
There's conspiracies,
man.

1085
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:34.920
If you don't think there are,

1086
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:37.110
if you don't think people are getting whacked left and right,

1087
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.570
let me tell you how it works.
If you have a lot of money,

1088
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:40.830
you know other people with a lot of money.

1089
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:41.970
If you know other people with a lot of money,

1090
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:43.500
you know other people that have ties to the military.

1091
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.910
If you know people that have ties to the military,

1092
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.020
you know people are mercenaries.

1093
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.660
If you know people live mercenaries and you have a problem when you get that

1094
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:50.640
problem taken care of,
he didn't get it taken care of,

1095
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:54.810
clean for not that much money.
I have friends that it worked as mercenaries.

1096
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.620
I have friends that worked for various companies overseas.
They were in the,

1097
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.210
they were in the marines and they were in,
you know,

1098
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:03.270
and they wanted to go back and make some money and they went back and they made

1099
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:06.360
a fuck load of money.
And it's not hard to find people like that.

1100
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.530
It's not hard at all.
You know,
so anybody that thinks that you can,
you know,

1101
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:15.330
run around fucking over Rupert Murdoch and that end up,
listen bitch,

1102
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.810
it doesn't even matter bad.
It doesn't even matter how public it is.

1103
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.720
That's how I'm going to say that's the scariest fucking part.
Because like,

1104
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:25.980
let's say that did happen,
right?
That means not only is he just like kill him,

1105
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:29.300
so all right,
already fucking creepy,
right?
Like take him out.
Uh,

1106
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.410
but on top of that,
knowing is going to be public.

1107
00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:34.590
Nobody's going to be that obvious.
Like,
couldn't even wait a fucking year.

1108
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.990
It's almost dead,
man.
He's almost dead.

1109
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.400
He's got a special cell phone that he keeps in his backyard.

1110
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.770
He has to pick up a rock.
He turns it on and he calls some dude.

1111
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:44.940
It looks like Charles Bronson,

1112
00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:47.990
but talks in a Russian accent and that's your ass bitch.
Fucking,

1113
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.690
he's an Australian.
Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.
It ain't hard,
dude.
It ain't hard.

1114
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:53.400
Trust me.
There's a lot of Goddamn people.

1115
00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:56.370
People can blend in and there's like 7 billion people on the planet.

1116
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.750
You don't think they could find someone to kill you?
Run Louise Boat,
by the way.

1117
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.540
I hope you don't mind.

1118
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.430
I'm sleeping over and now and just find that leaving the house.
Oh,

1119
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:08.670
you scared a little bit.
Don't be scared,
dude.
You're not saying anything bad.

1120
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.110
I don't think they would kill you for that.
I don't think so.
If you've got to,

1121
00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:13.600
you've got to be some wiki leaks.
Tech Shit.
Yeah,

1122
00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:16.170
there's a part of me that gets disappointed every time that like security,

1123
00:56:16.171 --> 00:56:18.420
they pass me along.
I'm like,
I'm not as edgy as I thought.

1124
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.260
Do you really think that like maybe you will wind up on the list someday for

1125
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:24.130
being an edgy comedian?
Yeah.
For one day.

1126
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.500
<v 2>One day.
I fucking hope so.
One day.
I hope so.
Cause I,</v>

1127
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.080
I just get bored of my fucking act that I'm like,
you sound that dude.
Uh,

1128
00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.520
the hacker thing.
So,
uh,
you brought up Bradley Manning.

1129
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:36.460
I was just watching this interview with the one guy who was pretty much has

1130
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:39.580
access to them.
This Guy David House,
we didn't actually bring him up.

1131
00:56:39.581 --> 00:56:42.730
He's the guy who wrote the Wiki leaks guy.
He's the,
uh,

1132
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:46.780
the soldier that gave up all the information and Juliana Song as part of this

1133
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:48.460
whole like hacking community.
I'm like,

1134
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.940
I want to get someone on our show where like,
you got to look into that.

1135
00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.770
Like this community is fucking fascinating.

1136
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:57.100
So I'm watching this kid to be interviewed and he's this really like a really

1137
00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:58.120
fucking smart guy.

1138
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:01.420
And I guess he was at a hacker conference and they can like spot out cause

1139
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.610
there's always like FBI agents and stuff like that.

1140
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.570
And apparently there were showing vintage footage of the civilians that were

1141
00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:09.780
killed.
The first big thing that came out from wikileaks from,

1142
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:10.720
from the helicopters.

1143
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.740
So they were showing footage of this and a horrifying horrifying.

1144
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.010
And this Guy David House was very calmly explaining.

1145
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:22.300
So I was sitting in the audience and I saw the guy next to me was an agent and

1146
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.700
Amy Goodman there,
the woman interviewing him was like,
how'd you know?

1147
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:27.610
He was an agent?
And this was like some Jason Bourne stuff.
He's like,

1148
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.100
was blackberry was tinted so he can see it at an angle.

1149
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.100
He was wearing khaki pants and a hacker tee shirt,

1150
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:36.250
which is the memo they all get when they all get emails to say to dress like us,

1151
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:39.580
except he had a shaped head that symbolized military or law enforcement.

1152
00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.150
So I leaned over to him and said,
just so you know,
you're supporting this.

1153
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.000
And the guy goes,
yeah,
yeah.
And then he left.

1154
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.900
But it's like how fucking creepy is that when you're involved in this just a

1155
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:52.270
hacker convention and it's just like,
you know that like you're saying,

1156
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.920
but it's like the guys,
like when I,
when I was 60,

1157
00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:55.030
I used to go to a phish concert.

1158
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.370
You see the guy with like the old tie dye shirt that's like,

1159
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.740
is anybody selling illegal narcotics?
And they're like,

1160
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:02.280
are you sure you're a cop dude?
Yeah.

1161
00:58:02.281 --> 00:58:04.660
I had a guy come up to me and Cleveland asked me for DMT.

1162
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:08.400
I'm pretty positive he was a cop.
Wow.
Yeah.
He was like asking me like,
really?

1163
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:11.110
Come on,
I ain't,
I get it.
Yeah.
And it was looking at the zone and so I was like,

1164
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:13.600
what are you talking about man?
Yeah.
It was weird.

1165
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:17.440
He had a crew cut and he was asking me about how to get DMT and like,

1166
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.700
I don't know how to get illegal drugs,
dude.
Wow.
We've had people at,
uh,

1167
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.960
we've got people at like our meetups and stuff,
be like,
you know,

1168
00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:25.960
so when do you think,
when do you think violence is?
Okay?
And we're just like,

1169
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:29.530
we're done.
We're done here.
You know what I mean?
Like,
let's look at you say it.

1170
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:32.560
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
That's kind of funny man.

1171
00:58:32.561 --> 00:58:36.100
That they could spot the hackers that easy or a spot.
The FDA agents that are,

1172
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:40.370
excuse me,
the hackers could spot them.
I thought that was silly.

1173
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:45.370
I know,
I know.
It's so ridiculous.
But you know,
when you have people,
I mean,

1174
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.820
there are people infiltrating like peace groups course and it's a,

1175
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:50.650
and it's crazy.
It's like that's where you're gonna put your,
you know,

1176
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:53.110
you say you're going after fucking al Qaeda and trying to keep us safe,

1177
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:54.490
but really the antiwar people,

1178
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:57.550
you're afraid to it that are going to commit violence.
I forget the pot story.

1179
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.960
Something about some growers up in the northeast or northwest or other,

1180
00:59:01.961 --> 00:59:05.900
and the way they found out that there was a,
um,
uh,

1181
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:07.820
an inside guy that was a,

1182
00:59:07.821 --> 00:59:11.420
a grower that was actually an FBI agent was he died in a motorcycle accident.

1183
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.900
I remember that it was revealed as a state cop.

1184
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:17.580
They covered under [inaudible] what the fuck.
Like you,
you,
you would've,
would've,

1185
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.470
would've waste of money you guys are doing here.
It's so ridiculous.

1186
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:22.580
We interviewed like this,
like hardcore

1187
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.910
<v 3>animal activist is getting Peter Young who was like part back in the day.</v>

1188
00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:28.160
It was part of the Animal Liberation Front.
Like,
oh,
those guys are,

1189
00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:30.260
no one went to jail for arson and shit.
Well though,

1190
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:32.060
they don't think you should even have pets.

1191
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.410
They think that every animal should be free.
Oh,
interesting.

1192
00:59:35.411 --> 00:59:38.210
That's their ultimate goals to release dogs and trip.

1193
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.690
Most of the animal activists that,
like I talked to our,
uh,

1194
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.040
incredibly pro adoption,
they're anti breeding,
but like,
yeah,
of course,

1195
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:50.720
pro adoption.
Um,
but anyways,
so,
uh,
so he actually had a woman,

1196
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:54.560
uh,
he essentially was dating an FBI agent.

1197
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.340
Like she infiltrated that way when all these road trips and just started asking

1198
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:02.210
all the right questions and he was banging her while he was at least we kind of

1199
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:05.060
alluded he was at least like hooking up and what does that mean,

1200
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:09.620
the cop to suck his dick?
I'm like that.
It's more worth it.
Do a little jail time.

1201
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.940
You know you fucked the shit out of that cup.

1202
01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.780
But I like what level of like evil is like that boss that it's like,

1203
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.180
go fuck this guy for information.

1204
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.880
What level of evils that girl and she can do that.
Yeah,
seriously.
Wow,

1205
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.150
that's dark dude.
Yep.
Ooh,
that's someone's daughter.

1206
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.020
Someone's daughter used her pussy to catch some animal terrorist guy.

1207
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.000
You know you're a snitch and kind of a slutty like you're both of those things

1208
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:35.990
dirty bitch or they just said that they arrested 14 people from it anonymous

1209
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:37.120
today.
Oh,

1210
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.330
they'd been arrested as part of an ongoing operation targeting the hacking

1211
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:44.030
collective.
Goddammit Joe,
we are on the list.
I'm staying here.

1212
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.180
Does it just happen?
Listen,

1213
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.200
I'm going to Republican fundraiser tomorrow or you want to go?
I

1214
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.450
might want to join in,
dude.

1215
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:58.190
I man just cut your hair a little closer to the scroll and wear a long sleeve

1216
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:01.970
shirts.
The light man.
Yeah.
No people see the light.
They'll be excited.

1217
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.060
They'll feel it.
They'll feel edgy.
Do they want to have one that was,

1218
01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:05.360
cause we have tattoos,
dude.

1219
01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:08.190
We fucking talk to a different group of people that they don't know.

1220
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.200
It's access to some people,
you know,
you know,

1221
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.030
they don't get those democracy now characters,
you know,

1222
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.440
you keep fucking put some sense into their head through you serious dude,
I,
I,

1223
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.300
I have to tell you,
I series man,
this Miller the whole deal.

1224
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.260
He did,
right.
Oh,
what happened man?
I'm wanting to ask him once,
man,

1225
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.530
I've only talked to him a few times.
I've talked to him on the rear,
on the radio,

1226
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:32.750
on his show.
And this has been very cool to me and I liked him.

1227
01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:33.880
He's a very nice guy.
Sure.
And,

1228
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:37.040
but one time we were alone in the bathroom taking a leak right next to each

1229
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:40.370
other and they're just trying to be like this is an act.
Right.
Cause he was,

1230
01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:45.100
this was 2003 this when fear factor or just starting to take off it goes Joey

1231
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:47.480
got yourself full hit there.
Congratulations.

1232
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.590
Or peeing next to me feel that I want to go.
What the fuck is going on?

1233
01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.470
I know Bush you hanging out with him.
What happened?

1234
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:58.360
What does that like you're going and hanging out at their house and an FBI
agent.

1235
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.100
This is fucked up.
You have an HIA.
What's weird?

1236
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:02.240
Cause I think he was legitimately,

1237
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:05.390
I think a lot of people got very like after nine 11 they definitely like

1238
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.860
legitimately at least on the war on terror front got a little republican each

1239
01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:11.210
cause everyone was fucking scared.
Right?
Rightly so.

1240
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.740
But then I just saw him recently on like Bill O'reilly and 70 he's like making

1241
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:17.360
fun of poor people and Shit like that.
It's like,
dude,

1242
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:20.160
you can be Republican on one level and not have to sell out everything

1243
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.530
<v 2>you used to believe in.
Like that's your kind of blows my mind.</v>

1244
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.290
Like someone said to me like,
Whoa,
wait,
you get some money and you'll,

1245
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.370
you'll become a republican.

1246
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.440
And like that was some of the most insulting she had where it's like,

1247
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.910
so you're saying that what I be kept money,

1248
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:32.180
I'm just going to sell out everything I ever believed in.

1249
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.590
Like I'm sure there are people who do it,
but Jesus Christ,
man,

1250
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.770
how can you be so shallow to say that and be okay that that came out of your

1251
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:38.140
mouth?

1252
01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.290
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1253
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:41.980
It's so silly to think that you would all of a sudden join that other team and

1254
01:02:41.981 --> 01:02:42.240
you know,

1255
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.300
you have a pretty open minded spectrum of ideas that you've adopted from a bunch

1256
01:02:46.301 --> 01:02:48.790
of different places.
Yeah.
Well you would all the sudden go,
no,

1257
01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:52.330
I'm here to protect all my goal.
You know,
instead of,

1258
01:02:52.331 --> 01:02:55.520
instead of being open minded and kind of like looking at the whole big picture

1259
01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:58.760
and said,
well they're both kind of crooks and you know what you do,
you know,

1260
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.590
you wouldn't do that.
You'd all sudden become a Republican.
It's so ridiculous,

1261
01:03:02.591 --> 01:03:04.370
you know,
and get some money.
Yeah,
I start prayer.

1262
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.710
The best thing money gives you the best thing is you don't worry about money.

1263
01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.390
That's the best thing money gives you.
Yeah,

1264
01:03:10.391 --> 01:03:13.600
I'm sure it's the number one thing it gives you people who don't,
you know,

1265
01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:16.390
they'll look at it like,
you know,
like Oh man,
it's not all about money.

1266
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.510
You're right.
But it's like a tool.
It's not all about hammers,

1267
01:03:19.511 --> 01:03:21.670
but if you want to build a fucking house,
maybe you shouldn't have a hammer.

1268
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.730
Right.
Okay.
Cause Hammers are awesome to build houses with.

1269
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.630
You going to use rocks and nail those nails.

1270
01:03:25.631 --> 01:03:29.230
You could build a house with a rock and,
and,
and,
and,
and nails.

1271
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.900
But you're way better off making some money.
Right.
We,

1272
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.260
we've been her off figuring out how you don't have to get rich.

1273
01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.230
Just get to a point where you can be comfortable.

1274
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.650
You don't have to wake up in a fucking sweating.

1275
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.200
Like I always used to do exactly what you were like,
fuck,

1276
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:43.070
how am I going to feed myself this week?
Yeah.
Well,

1277
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.700
when you get to a point where you don't have to worry about those things,

1278
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:48.460
you're not going to change and become a Republican.

1279
01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:51.410
You're not going to fucking all of the sudden say fuck the world I needed,

1280
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.140
which Wa that's ridiculous.

1281
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.930
<v 2>Get his any republican who doesn't have $1 trillion.</v>

1282
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.750
You know what I mean?
Who isn't just so rich?
And it's like,

1283
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.560
I think it's because they,
and again,
our representation,

1284
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.670
the Democrats representation liberal stereotype,
like it's horrible.

1285
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.010
But anytime I talked to like a level head,
a conservative,

1286
01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:12.480
and like we actually have a conversation,

1287
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.120
we realize we're all being fucked by the same people.
Right?

1288
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.540
And the bottom line is Republicans have gotten really good as,
what did they say?

1289
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.970
They say,
we don't want to raise taxes.
So if you're poor,
you're middle class,

1290
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:22.350
you hear that and you go,
yeah,
that makes sense.

1291
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.940
Because I need every penny that I can get.

1292
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.330
What they're actually saying is we're not going to raise taxes on the upper 1%,

1293
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.990
which the majority of people are not.
Obviously the upper 1%.

1294
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.690
So that means that someone who already has $1 billion,

1295
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:37.350
it doesn't want to give away a tiny percentage of that,

1296
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.250
which they won't even fucking notice is there.
And because of that,

1297
01:04:41.251 --> 01:04:45.450
that's going to defund however many schools that's going to,
uh,
you know,

1298
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:46.950
that money could have been used to create jobs,

1299
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:49.440
to create infrastructure with all these fucking bridges that are collapsing.

1300
01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:53.600
Right?
And so it's not you.
They don't want to fucking rob you all the,

1301
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:56.820
the Bush tax cuts.
Look,
they're talking about the debt ceiling right now.

1302
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.040
We've raised the debt ceiling under every recent president.

1303
01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:00.120
The only one we didn't,

1304
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:03.800
the only one who didn't George Bush raise the debt ceiling several times over.

1305
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.990
<v 4>We don't want it.
There's a black president.</v>

1306
01:05:05.991 --> 01:05:08.150
The last thing you want him to do is running up his credit card.

1307
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:10.040
That's very true.
That's what's going on.

1308
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:14.990
This guy's trying to get shit on layaway.
Is it?
We know how they are.

1309
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:18.040
They're very bling bling.
But the only one did the worry fancy.

1310
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.500
The only one who did it or their fancy,
the only one who didn't raise it,

1311
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:23.410
that's the name was Bill Clinton because we actually had a surplus under
Clinton.

1312
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.010
Then Bush came in and I remember a lot of these same republicans who are cutting

1313
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:30.070
all the,
this,
the,
the funding from Medicare and stuff.
Uh,
there,

1314
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.840
they're still an office.
They were in an office with Bush.

1315
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.720
Bush comes in and cuts tax cuts for the rich,
uh,

1316
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:38.410
and goes to war and suddenly we all this money and we're back in bed and it's

1317
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:42.250
like,
it wasn't,
it wasn't the democratic problem with taxes.

1318
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.740
My number one problem is,
you know,

1319
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.380
saying that you're going to take away more money from people,

1320
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:49.220
whether it's from rich people or whether it's from poor,

1321
01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:50.830
where would the fuck you it?
Yeah.

1322
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.430
I don't trust you to manage that money correctly.

1323
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.390
So I don't believe that if you take more money from rich people,

1324
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:00.190
it is going to necessarily fix anything.

1325
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.880
I think it's probably going to create a bunch of fucking jobs that we don't

1326
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.740
really need.
That's what's really gonna happen.

1327
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.240
It's gonna get more money for taxes and what does this incompetent fucked up

1328
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:11.074
government going to do?

1329
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.060
What they're going to create more jobs to to require more money so they can

1330
01:06:16.061 --> 01:06:18.250
continue to get more taxes every year.

1331
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:22.480
I don't believe that it's going to funnel directly into education.
Yeah.

1332
01:06:22.481 --> 01:06:24.790
I mean that community improvement as I did,

1333
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.970
if I thought it was handled by competent people,
I would support it.

1334
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.120
But when you start talking about 48% tax brackets and ridiculous shit like that,

1335
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.380
I got to go,
where's this money going?

1336
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:39.020
And Are you getting a a direct result,

1337
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.850
a fair proportion of resources for what you put in?

1338
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.880
Well that's a problem is so it's passionate up a system that's completely

1339
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:51.090
fucked.
Well,
the on the backs of the successful people,
I think in the success,

1340
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:51.700
sorry,

1341
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.420
I will just say one more thing and I do agree that successful people have made

1342
01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:57.940
it to be successful because of this system and they should,

1343
01:06:57.941 --> 01:07:00.700
could probably contribute more.
I absolutely think that,

1344
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:04.270
but I think I don't trust the people that are in charge of doing it to be

1345
01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:07.580
competent in it.
Who the fuck would want to be handling taxes?
Right?

1346
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.050
Who the fuck would be wanting to be distributing wealth and,
and doing it,

1347
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:13.120
you know,
uh,
all these people are paying taxes.

1348
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.340
You've got to figure out where the fuck it goes.
God Man.

1349
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:18.040
Who the fuck would want that some creep?
Yeah.
Well don't get me wrong.

1350
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:19.540
I mean there's definitely something in the middle of like,

1351
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.800
I want to say socialism works,

1352
01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:22.960
but if I could have been on the underground farm and see the hell and that can

1353
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:25.150
break colors there,
everyone has been on a message board just kind of like,

1354
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:25.451
all right,

1355
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:30.100
maybe we need some totalitarian socialism doesn't work because there's too many

1356
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:30.671
weak cons.

1357
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:33.580
There's too many lazy fucking people who are not going to do their share.

1358
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.840
If everyone was cool and every one was of sound character and we had this sort

1359
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:41.680
of a,
a community where,
you know,
I need a coconut.
You A,
you know,

1360
01:07:41.681 --> 01:07:44.600
you can let me borrow some woods.
I remember a lot of these legacy costs are,

1361
01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:47.470
you know,
whenever you say lazy con are you say Welfare Queen,

1362
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:48.940
what do you think of you think of the fucking end,

1363
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.410
some poor black family who has like,

1364
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:52.660
I don't think of that saying lazy white guys.

1365
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.510
So many of the pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

1366
01:07:55.511 --> 01:07:59.200
People were born into that wealth and they're like,
why don't you do what I do?

1367
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:02.200
It's like what?
Go come out of your mom's badge.
Like there's nothing.

1368
01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:04.810
I can't be born into what your real issue is.

1369
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.480
The numbers are out of control.

1370
01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.760
There's too many human beings that we're trying to manage.

1371
01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:13.090
We're supposed to be in small tribes of 5,200 people.

1372
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:16.010
We should know each other shit in my for you,
because I don't

1373
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.020
<v 2>know the answer to this because I don't not agree with you.</v>

1374
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:19.580
What you said about the government being an APP,

1375
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.600
you know this is the first year that a citizen radio actually like we pay taxes

1376
01:08:23.601 --> 01:08:26.720
on it,
right?
And there was part of me,
I'm like,
yeah,
I'm fucking proud.

1377
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:29.390
Like this is this.
This is one,
I could have turned it to a Republican,

1378
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:32.180
but I'm gonna,
I'm gonna pay tax,
I'm gonna fun schools,
I'm going blah blah blah.

1379
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:34.250
And I'm like,
yeah,
mailed off the check and then I was like,

1380
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.290
that's probably going to kill some Iraqis.
You know what I mean?

1381
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.260
Like you don't know where that fucking money is going on.
But with that said so,

1382
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:43.460
but what's the other option?
So it's either you have been an ex patriot,
Thailand.

1383
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.130
Yeah,
Noble Shit off the Internet in Thailand with taxes,

1384
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:48.530
you either have the inept government you were talking about,
right.

1385
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:52.100
Or the greedy for profit Republicans.
Both are Shitty,

1386
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.880
but what's fucking worse?
And then it's a good question.
What's the in the middle?

1387
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:59.330
Do you ever think about that?
Because you were a really extremely politically,

1388
01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:03.890
politically active guy and your,
your radio show is based around,

1389
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.450
I mean essentially a lot of it is of our own politics of Noam Chomsky's you ever

1390
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:12.430
feel like,
man,
maybe I'm a commentator on pro wrestling or any,
this is awesome.

1391
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.000
Fucking phony horse shit.
And I'm caught up in this pretending it's all real.

1392
01:09:17.001 --> 01:09:18.920
And getting everybody,
you know this

1393
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.830
<v 3>Glenn Beck,
September 12th rally to the American,</v>

1394
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.290
you're a part of the problem almost.
Yeah.
Almost

1395
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.420
<v 2>legitimizing this horse shit now.
I mean,
I think,
I think it's,</v>

1396
01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:31.420
I think it's really easy to think that because again,
it seems,

1397
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.910
<v 3>by the way,
it's just a question.
It's just a question.
Yeah.</v>

1398
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:35.250
And the people are out dealing.
Get you mad.

1399
01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:37.260
You were attacking him for being active.
Absolutely not.

1400
01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:39.850
I'm just proposing this and I don't,
I don't necessarily mean

1401
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.370
<v 2>that way or the other way.
Well,
people could either be like,</v>

1402
01:09:42.371 --> 01:09:44.350
you're attacking him for being accurate.
Be like,
talk about tits.

1403
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.340
<v 3>There's a lot of that makes a lot of talk about farts right now.</v>

1404
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.970
Eating my girlfriend's asshole this weekend.
You got caught.

1405
01:09:50.971 --> 01:09:55.770
[inaudible] grown man caught me eating my girlfriend's ass.
Those happen.
We,

1406
01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:58.720
she's featured dancing.
So we're in the green room and were born.
I'm like,

1407
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.170
can I just start eating her asshole?

1408
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.120
I thought I locked her door and the guy walks in and goes,
oh,
sorry.
And I had to,

1409
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.000
I wasn't an invitation for you to completely change the subject.
By the way,

1410
01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:12.610
the Oh fucking Weirdo.
I'll try to segue back.

1411
01:10:12.611 --> 01:10:15.100
The old asshole eating industrial complex

1412
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.220
when you're trying to eat some ass.

1413
01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:23.221
Brian has been banging way over his head so just allow him cause indiscretion

1414
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:28.480
standard.
Very happy,
very happy to have a girl,

1415
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:32.770
doesn't want to have anything to do with him and he can eat her asshole at the

1416
01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:34.840
drop of a dime.
So he likes to talk about anything.

1417
01:10:34.841 --> 01:10:38.020
So just like entertaining though because he doesn't understand that it's really

1418
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.180
for other people.
They're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
All right dude.
Show.

1419
01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:42.940
You know how horrible it was talking like a grown man,
like,

1420
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:45.250
like he didn't leave and be like,
oh I'm sorry.

1421
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:48.520
He was still talking to my girlfriend going like instructions for it to do

1422
01:10:48.521 --> 01:10:50.710
something and I had to like slowly stand up,

1423
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.320
sit there and just act like I didn't slowly wipe your mouth with,

1424
01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.590
well at least you didn't get douchey like most boyfriends of strippers would.

1425
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.360
Yeah,
no,
it's really funny when they have rules,

1426
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:08.520
chicks yet on the stage,
now you're fucking creep.
Meanwhile,

1427
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.890
she's out there s shoving dildos in her mouth and shit.
That's okay.

1428
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.070
Those are ours for my home into

1429
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.100
<v 5>the room without knocking.
Right.
You know?
Yes.</v>

1430
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:17.880
They knocked to make sure that she's okay.

1431
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:20.340
Is a certain amount of privacy that you must respect.
Oh,

1432
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:22.040
I didn't know you're getting your ass hole Eaton.
Yup.

1433
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.770
It's weird how much feature dancing and comedian goes together.

1434
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:29.280
Like it was exactly like being on the road with you except that you,
you,
you,

1435
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:29.521
you know,

1436
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:31.980
you don't take off your clothes but in stuff like that and play cooter ball.

1437
01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.970
But it was exactly the same that you get picked up at the airport and you have a

1438
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:39.570
hotel.
Like it was so weird.
You hate your father.

1439
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.340
And then the club operated the same.
It's gotta be a weird stalkery thing.
No,

1440
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:45.180
she isn't.
She,

1441
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.810
we're in the middle of Montana and there she's dancing and they know that she

1442
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:52.730
has fans.
I guess she even has fans that are like Twitter fans that are awesome,

1443
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.650
that knew who I was just because of falling her on Twitter.

1444
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.120
So they wanted to meet you too.

1445
01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.990
Now they just stared at me and like Hamilton Gade dance with your Carol frame.

1446
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.610
He is way dances.
Like lap dances.
Yeah,

1447
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.600
I would murder everybody just started [inaudible] she like,

1448
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.840
she has to like sit on dude's lap.
So Dude's off the Internet.

1449
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:17.870
They know you girlfriend and then they go and they can get lap dances from your

1450
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:22.530
girlfriend.
Absolutely.
What the good thing is is that she goes and goes,
okay,

1451
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.270
I have time for two.

1452
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.220
I would've picked this old rich couple over here and dance for his wife and I

1453
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:33.030
might choose that big fat old kid with the glasses that looks like he's never

1454
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:36.600
been laid.
So she'll just do that instead of like she gives away charity.
Pussy.

1455
01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:37.434
Yeah.

1456
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:42.150
I think there was like a fraternity there at that odd and wouldn't do any of

1457
01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:46.050
them.
I know people who are swingers,
you know,

1458
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:50.130
and I don't this,
I don't know.
That's,
that's the next level.

1459
01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.020
I do know people,

1460
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:55.770
I know people who will get together as couples and they'll go and try to fuck

1461
01:12:55.771 --> 01:13:00.300
other couples and they're like,
be in the room,
watch some guys railing your wife.

1462
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.770
Just fucking the shit out of her and they get off on it.
Yeah.
Like what,

1463
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:08.810
<v 2>uh,

1464
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:09.771

1465
01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:12.130
He was kind of was hoping you weren't going to say me and preventative.

1466
01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:12.973
We're going to gang bang,

1467
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:20.170
<v 2>uh,
each other lap dances hoping I'm fucking,</v>

1468
01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:24.880
his wife I episode of the Green Room hasn't aired yet as an admin on the show

1469
01:13:24.881 --> 01:13:28.650
somehow.
Yeah.
Premiered last week.
Um,
and uh,

1470
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.150
I said she really good man for the first,
uh,

1471
01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:35.950
the first I was said it was like channeling and Apatow and fucking,
anyway,

1472
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.400
so,
uh,
so fucking,
uh,

1473
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.590
so we were in this podcast and he was kind of going after me for being like a

1474
01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.420
prude and stuff cause he's like,
yeah,

1475
01:13:43.421 --> 01:13:47.440
he's very like in that sort of sexual revolution.
And uh,

1476
01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:50.290
and so there were a bunch of grood how will you approved?
Oh,
I mean,

1477
01:13:50.291 --> 01:13:55.000
just like very like a meat and potatoes.
Fucking not swingers and that,

1478
01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:55.721
you know what I mean?

1479
01:13:55.721 --> 01:14:00.100
Like those fucking some happy days type shit.

1480
01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:04.820
Yeah.
Everyone's in a good mood and like,
we're like,
we're doing this all right,

1481
01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.150
let's fuck.
And uh,
and so masks or ball gags or,
yeah,

1482
01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.160
it's pretty like,
it's pretty,
there's not much you have to clean

1483
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.030
<v 3>up afterwards.
Like we can still look at each other in the eye,
you know,</v>

1484
01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:20.240
breakfast together without happy and like what you did was awful.
Um,
and,

1485
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.380
and Paul asked,
you know,
he's like,
how many girls in here?

1486
01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:27.260
I have rape fantasies now.
We were not,
we were not in like,
uh,

1487
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.113
with like dancers or anything.

1488
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.920
I was fucking science convention and there were girls in the room,
a big,
small,

1489
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:37.750
pretty unattractive,
uh,
probably 18 to like 40 and married.

1490
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:42.130
All of them raised their hands,
by the way,
it doesn't give the audience too.

1491
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.070
If the audience is listening,
I'm like,
oh,
well if that's what they want.

1492
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.250
But I was definitely where I'm like,
man,

1493
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:51.060
there was a lot of sexual shit that I do not know about.
Like,

1494
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.970
they'll never understand what it's like to be a woman.
We,

1495
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.300
we've tried to pretend we do,

1496
01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:58.690
but I think you know how like a woman will never understand what it's like to be

1497
01:14:58.691 --> 01:15:02.920
you and you just kind of try to be cool round her and try to be what she would

1498
01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:03.880
like from you.

1499
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.030
It's not the fuck it up when things down just to keep anybody from getting
crazy.

1500
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.150
Well it's with that,
with them even though much more extreme way.

1501
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:13.740
We don't know what the fuck it's like to want to get held down and fucked.
Right.

1502
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:17.740
Cause I used to date a girl who was a very nice person and she was very educated

1503
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.880
and she like getting held down and fuck.
She would try to get up.

1504
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That was her thing.
She was fucking smart man.
She had,

1505
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:28.150
I don't want to say what school she went to,
but she was a very,
very,

1506
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:31.630
very bright person.
Very highly educated and she liked getting raped there.
Okay.

1507
01:15:31.631 --> 01:15:32.261
That was her thing.

1508
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.140
And She just wanted to get raped by somebody she liked to force.
Yeah.

1509
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.660
That was where the thing was.
I couldn't understand that.
I don't know.

1510
01:15:37.661 --> 01:15:40.930
I didn't understand it.
But there's nothing like a huge difference between,

1511
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:45.240
you know,
no one wants to get my,
hey everybody,
sorry.

1512
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.030
I was young back then and I was quite a bit more savage than I am now.

1513
01:15:49.031 --> 01:15:50.260
I'm quite a bit more civilized,

1514
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.130
so I was really worried like I would like really get into rape and chicks this.

1515
01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:56.470
She might,
she might be my fucking

1516
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.260
thing that I didn't know about it.

1517
01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:03.280
She was really hot and she was really kind of crazy and fun,
you know?

1518
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:06.590
And so I was like,
shit,
I hope I don't like just get into this.
Right.

1519
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.620
This isn't my new thing now.
You know?
I don't want to need to rate people.
Yeah,

1520
01:16:10.621 --> 01:16:13.390
that's right.
I like,
like you know,
you look,

1521
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:18.630
obviously we don't completely understand how human behavior comes to fruition.

1522
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.990
We know that there's factors,
but we don't completely understand all of them.

1523
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.290
Yeah.

1524
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:27.160
I mean it's very possible that something could happen to turn you down a dark

1525
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:28.510
road.
Yeah.
I mean,

1526
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:31.420
I don't know if it has to happen during the formative period of your,

1527
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.900
of your life or if it's possible for some weird shit to happen.

1528
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:38.680
Like if you go to prison or you get addicted to a drug and it also may not even

1529
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:43.150
be like as darker road as like,
you know,
you think it is because I again,

1530
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:46.860
I don't think,
you know,
obviously they wouldn't want to get raped.
Uh,

1531
01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.230
but it could just be like people like aggressive sex,
you know,

1532
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:51.440
guys fantasize about aggressive sex.
The same thing,
you know,

1533
01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:55.790
you don't want to get rid of it.
Just the,
the,
she wanted to fight back when no,

1534
01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:57.390
there was a little rape of wow.

1535
01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.420
I they did girls get slapped and I was like always like free.

1536
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.520
Like at first I was just like,
I don't want to do this.

1537
01:17:03.521 --> 01:17:06.080
And I was thinking it later in life.
Am I going to start elbowing her?

1538
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.940
I didn't realize when I first started dating her why she wanted to date me in

1539
01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:14.330
the first place.
Cause I was,
I had never graduated college.

1540
01:17:14.331 --> 01:17:19.060
I went to Umass Boston.
I just say that she went to Harvard and,
um,
she just,
uh,

1541
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.900
she was just,
Oh,
Becky,
shut the fuck off.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
But,

1542
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:26.950
um,
you know,
what she wanted was,
you know,

1543
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.500
some young savage person,
right.
The fuck the shit out of her.

1544
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.190
It's just like a guy who's an intelligent guy.
Like I've seen,

1545
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.970
I know a guy who was an executive that lost his entire career because he was a

1546
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:41.960
brilliant guy just of stop.
He couldn't stop going after young hot pussy.

1547
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.650
Like he would,
he would and eventually got them in all sorts of trouble,

1548
01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:48.380
but it was young,
dumb,
hot pussy.
That's what he wanted.

1549
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.440
That's what does grow on it.
Yeah.
It's interesting Matt,
and like,
and,

1550
01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:54.450
and you know,
I don't like dudes who used the whole like biological things,

1551
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.650
like as an excuse to cheat,
but there definitely is something there.
But like,

1552
01:17:57.651 --> 01:18:01.280
anytime that,
like there's a girl,
and especially for comics because like,
I mean,

1553
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:04.340
you,
uh,
you were probably,
I'd read a situation and maybe,
but like,

1554
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:06.920
I didn't get girls until I became a comic.
Um,

1555
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:09.410
so there's part of me that I'm like,
I'm making up for fucking last time

1556
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.050
this wasn't fair.
Like,

1557
01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:15.260
this is for every fucking girl that was like my best friend and just like fucked

1558
01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:18.200
me over and called me when her boyfriend like was a Dick,
you know?

1559
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:22.860
And so I just started fucking and fucking and,
uh,
and say,
look,

1560
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.900
you're marching
for holidays.

1561
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:34.280
And uh,
and,
and uh,

1562
01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:38.900
and I just remember like,
uh,
I don't even know where that was going.

1563
01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:41.950
Like I think was part of me.
There's just like,
yeah,
I did that.
Ah,

1564
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.730
that was awesome.
But you were saying,
so then,
uh,

1565
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:51.080
so now,
you know,
like,
I'm like so happily fucking married,

1566
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:52.490
like I don't think about it,
you know,

1567
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:54.710
once you get someone on like an intellectual level,

1568
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.790
even like the hottest girl can come up to you and a second she's just dumb or

1569
01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:01.880
mean or selfish,
you just becomes like,
just not hot.
So anyway,

1570
01:19:01.881 --> 01:19:05.870
so the point though is you've experienced that.
Yes,
exactly.

1571
01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:08.510
That's the thing that some people never have.
And some people,

1572
01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:13.240
their relationships are always just sexual nature.
Exactly.
Taller than,
yeah,

1573
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:17.960
that's what it becomes easy to cheat nowadays.
Like anytime I've even like,

1574
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.810
you know when you have like a hot girl for like a split second and talk to you

1575
01:19:20.811 --> 01:19:24.320
after a shower,
when you were like,
oh,
did you get nostalgic for the old days?

1576
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.320
Or whenever you go home to your hotel,
you jerk off and it,
it's,

1577
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:34.190
it's the,
it's the best kind of jerking off because it's not,
uh,
not just sexual,

1578
01:19:34.191 --> 01:19:37.520
but it's also such a mental relief because you forget when guys fantasize about

1579
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:39.830
cheating,
all they think about is like the fucking or the comic.

1580
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:42.680
They forget about like the conversation that leads to that.

1581
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.530
They forget about how would the conversation afterwards,
afterwards,

1582
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.110
the awkward section,
you know,
how about the six months where you're like,
oh,

1583
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:51.710
is she crazy and get to pretend to be fucking pregnant.
Like,
how about,
oh,

1584
01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:55.490
that shit,
all that shit.
You totally forget about it.
And then once you jerk off,

1585
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.940
I'm like,
you know,
the worst thing I have to do fucking clean up,
get,

1586
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:01.580
I have a friend who is,
he?
He's,
he's so crazy.

1587
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:03.530
Like he's always banging the nuttiest chicks over.

1588
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:08.260
This girl blew him and was trying to convince him that she's pregnant.
Stop

1589
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.720
<v 4>it.
Yeah,
she's that crazy.
I go,
how crazy these girls,
he goes,
the craziest,</v>

1590
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:16.070
the craziest,
just the worst.
I'm just nuts.
And I go,

1591
01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:17.460
what the fuck is wrong with you,
man?

1592
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:21.330
You're letting these people into your life like you're letting insane people

1593
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:22.860
into your life and the only,

1594
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:26.430
the only standard they have to reach as a sexual one.
All right?
You don't,

1595
01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:28.860
you don't need to know that much about their personality.
You don't care.

1596
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:29.791
You're just so crazy.

1597
01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:33.630
You let some nutty bitch suck your Dick and now you're trading phone calls with

1598
01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:36.210
her and you have to change your phone number because she's trying to convince

1599
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:40.020
you that she blew you and got pregnant.
Check gives me such anxiety,

1600
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:47.790
some naughty ones out there,
man.
Fucking people out there.

1601
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:49.500
Some are there could be just a weird deformed baby.

1602
01:20:49.501 --> 01:20:54.050
Maybe it actually happened just like you have to believe it maybe.
Well,

1603
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.630
there has been one,
the African story that's a,
uh,
believe it's a true story.

1604
01:20:57.631 --> 01:20:58.890
I don't think it's been debunked.

1605
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:02.610
A woman got in a knife fight shortly after she gave a guy a blow job and then

1606
01:21:02.611 --> 01:21:05.610
she became pregnant and the reason she became pregnant because the knife went

1607
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.041
into her.

1608
01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:10.650
You know her whole fucking girly parts under to load actually carry through from

1609
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:14.340
the knife into the a womb.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
I mean,

1610
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:17.130
I hope this is a bullshit story.
I hope it's not a bullshit story.

1611
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:20.800
I don't want to review it because I like to tell it.
I hope it's still real hot.

1612
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.430
This I have no vagina.
That was the point.

1613
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.490
That's the reason why it was so interesting.
The woman was,
she's African.

1614
01:21:26.491 --> 01:21:29.970
She was born with no vagina and that's why it was crazy that she got pregnant.

1615
01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.340
They're going to be a lot of knife fighting.

1616
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.170
Vaginalis women listening to this show that are very upset.
Right?
I don't know.

1617
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.690
I can't do what many more.

1618
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:40.320
That was the one fucking pleasure I had was knife fighting after a good blow
job.

1619
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:43.530
Well,
I don't believe in the immaculate conception.

1620
01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.990
I don't believe in the Virgin Mary.
I don't think that's a miracle,

1621
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.020
but maybe the messiah comes from a blowjob knife fight.

1622
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.970
Maybe that's the Messiah that maybe that child will grow up and realize the

1623
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:56.040
folly of his ways.
Everything.
Yeah.

1624
01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:58.200
What kind of a woman's looks at Dick and then gets in a knife fight.

1625
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:00.540
His mom must be fucking crazy.
So from the get go,

1626
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:03.630
he's going to have to figure out things for himself.
So you know,

1627
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:07.330
it might be what's going on.
That might be the Jesus.
I'm pretty,

1628
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:11.070
let's go with that.
It was going to,
so keep an eye on him,
man.

1629
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.080
Somebody get them around then that Marcus Barkman guy.
Man,
I can't figure it out.

1630
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:20.940
Figure it out.
If that little African boys,
the Jesus,
I hope I,
I hope,

1631
01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.170
I hope so.
Cause I'm like if,
if the,

1632
01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.560
if the religious people are right and if there is a guide right now and if there

1633
01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:27.760
is like a Jesus,
like you're,
you guys are cons,

1634
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.670
you're letting a lot of bad shit happen.

1635
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.340
I think this whole world is a fucking illusion,

1636
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.980
I think is just a really complicated,

1637
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:39.390
fantastically created figment of your imagination.
Fig Newton,

1638
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:41.940
you're living your figment.
I'm living my figment.

1639
01:22:41.941 --> 01:22:46.470
And they all combined together in some sort of a weird fucking quantum physics

1640
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:50.190
soup.
That's what I think the older I get,
and the more pot I smoked,

1641
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.380
slippery or reality gets folks.
I'm not buying it anymore.

1642
01:22:55.890 --> 01:23:00.120
Guys named Wiener get busted for taking pictures of their Dick.

1643
01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.110
And when the war keeps rolling on the Internet is true.

1644
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:06.780
That is funny to think about.
Like it's just someone fucking with us.
Like,

1645
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:08.650
let's see if they,
let's see if they buy this shit.
Really?

1646
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:11.380
You couldn't put it together after the wiener thing.
Keep going.

1647
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.690
I think as the apocalypse gets closer and closer,

1648
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.240
it's going to be more and more ridiculous.
You know?

1649
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.050
I think that's what furries are all about.

1650
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.100
I think that that's what this world is all about,
man.
It's as,

1651
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:24.460
as we get closer and closer to the end of our each individual lives,

1652
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.530
our imagination is going to spiral this nutty fucking reality further and

1653
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:31.360
further out of control.
It's like the Truman show,

1654
01:23:31.361 --> 01:23:34.750
but we just didn't figure it out.
We just kept were like,
this is nice.
Dot Dot,

1655
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:37.350
dot.
It's just way more complex.
You know what I mean?

1656
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.590
If you listen to Kurtzweil or any of these futurists that talk about the

1657
01:23:41.591 --> 01:23:45.160
potential artificial realities that will be constructed in the near future,

1658
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:47.790
you know,
within uh,
uh,
you know,

1659
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.270
a lifetime for sure they will be able to construct some sort of an artificial

1660
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:54.450
reality that is indistinguishable from this room.

1661
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:55.400
<v 2>Well,
that's why I love,</v>

1662
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.720
that's why I love science so much more than religion and kind of do AIG

1663
01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:02.630
spiritual shit is because like,
I feel like with religion people were like,

1664
01:24:02.631 --> 01:24:05.000
I'm done.
We figured it out.
I'm a science.
Like what's the goal?

1665
01:24:05.001 --> 01:24:07.760
The science of science is to keep asking questions is to prove yourself wrong,

1666
01:24:07.761 --> 01:24:10.380
is to keep looking and looking and looking.
Yeah.
And,
and,

1667
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.680
and that to me like you can't just say you're fucking done.

1668
01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:13.940
You would have to keep looking like that.

1669
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.110
I mean that could be one of the points of life's just,

1670
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.510
it's just figuring shit out.

1671
01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.890
<v 4>It certainly is,
but I think there's something to religion as well.
And what,</v>

1672
01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.010
what is to religion is,
even though it's not real,
if you believe it's real,

1673
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:27.790
it can do amazing things for you,
man.
It's a mental thing.
Really.
Yeah.
Well it's,

1674
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.210
there's something to the extreme positive thinking.

1675
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:35.890
There's something to the idea that,
you know,
you are working towards God's goals,

1676
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.690
you know,
and if you really truly believe that,

1677
01:24:37.691 --> 01:24:40.230
I think that's incredibly empowering,
sort of.

1678
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:42.790
I think it's empowering in the sense that like there are definitely people who

1679
01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:45.850
are like,
I'm working for God and then like get abortion doctor.
And I was like,

1680
01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.550
wow.
Well there is that.
And that's unfortunate,
but that's not in the,

1681
01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:54.160
in the mind of God,
the mind of the true Christian religion,
ideas of God.

1682
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:56.830
It's love your brother,
love people as if they were you.

1683
01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.880
<v 2>Have you ever thought about this though?
Cause like,
so that's what I used to say.</v>

1684
01:24:59.881 --> 01:25:02.840
Right?
And then,
uh,
two things happen.
Uh,

1685
01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:06.300
and they're both completely fucking,
I hate talking about it.
Uh,

1686
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:09.600
but the first one was,
so I was very like spiritual,
but not religious,
right?

1687
01:25:09.601 --> 01:25:10.210
Where I'm lacking

1688
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:13.220
<v 4>well,
religion.
So it sounds like what a stripper was a yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.</v>

1689
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:15.960
Or just like everybody in college,
why don't you smoke it?
Yeah.

1690
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.430
Well it kind of spiritual,
but not really,
really

1691
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:22.210
<v 2>it be,
there's gotta be something out there.
Yeah.
That was,
that was may.
And uh,</v>

1692
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:26.180
and I remember,
uh,
I use this kind of guy cause you can,

1693
01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:30.310
you can do the opposite of what you were doing.
Like I remember I go,
uh,
I would,

1694
01:25:30.311 --> 01:25:34.180
we were at Niagara Falls and I pulled this shit on my wife who's a,

1695
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:38.290
who's an atheist and I did the thing that's so many people who are spiritual but

1696
01:25:38.291 --> 01:25:42.790
not religious do or it's just like,
look at that,
look at that magical,

1697
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.650
how would you say that's something didn't create it.

1698
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:49.750
She very politely walked me over to the sign that told me how Niagara Falls was

1699
01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:53.590
made and I was like,
oh,
that's awesome.
Like that's really fucking cool.

1700
01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:55.490
And like I would have never thought about that before.

1701
01:25:55.491 --> 01:25:58.480
And when it comes to what you were saying with like that doing something greater

1702
01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.530
than yourself.
I was actually much more selfish until I was atheist.

1703
01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:03.980
And if you

1704
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.490
<v 3>actually look at a like a map and pulls to the most,
uh,</v>

1705
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:10.700
charitable countries are the most secular.
So why is that?

1706
01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:13.190
Because we always think of religion is doing all these charities and stuff with

1707
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:16.070
the majority of charities are doing number one,
just go right back to the church.

1708
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:19.010
Sure.
You have a lot of people helping poor kids in Africa,

1709
01:26:19.011 --> 01:26:21.650
but they're also stealing that condoms and telling them that he just created by

1710
01:26:21.651 --> 01:26:24.410
God.
Right.
So that's more fucked up.
I think they're,

1711
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:27.170
the reason the more secular country isn't that a lot of the reason that atheists

1712
01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:28.160
are more charitable,

1713
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:30.860
it's cause there were so many times where I see a homeless person or I'll see

1714
01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:34.010
something and it wouldn't be affected by it because I'm like God has a plan and

1715
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:37.130
it just kind of gives you this out and it gives you kind of carte blanche just

1716
01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:40.960
to ignore shit.
That's a negative aspect of it.
The gating,

1717
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:44.120
the positive aspects of not having like my sister's fucking a born again

1718
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:46.790
Christian and she built a school for poor kids in Saint Louis and I can't be

1719
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:49.360
like,
you're stupid.
The Bible has contradictions.
I'm like,
no,

1720
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.360
keep helping the poor kids.

1721
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.590
I don't necessarily think it had to be Christian either to just be by by saying

1722
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:57.230
the believing in religion or believing in God,
believing in something.

1723
01:26:57.470 --> 01:27:00.470
I think it's,
you can say that it's a mental crutch,

1724
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:04.750
but it can also be a framework for getting through this existence.
Sure.

1725
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.380
But I mean they're atheists,
you know what I'm saying?

1726
01:27:06.381 --> 01:27:09.740
Like I'm going to [inaudible].
The reality is,
man,

1727
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:12.800
you have a certain amount of fucking time here from beginning to end and the

1728
01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:15.950
most amount of this time that you can spend in a positive light,

1729
01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.310
the the best that's,
that's the best option.
And if you can,

1730
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:23.600
if you can figure out how to enjoy it the most and if the enjoying it is going

1731
01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:26.360
by this idea that as you,
as you end,

1732
01:27:26.361 --> 01:27:29.960
you will give in to some sort of a higher power that sort of has this,

1733
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:33.440
there's this vision of this the way the world is supposed to be.

1734
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:36.420
But is that almost even,
is that even real positivity in the sense?

1735
01:27:36.421 --> 01:27:41.260
Have you ever done psychedelic drugs?
Yeah.
Uh,
just mushrooms.
Uh,

1736
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.870
I think Allison and I are probably not like just like three times.
How big,

1737
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:48.950
how much money?
No,
at once.
Whatever they gave us.
Oh,
okay.
And were you just,

1738
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.840
I mean seen God yet homey.
We can straighten that out if you like.

1739
01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:58.700
If you guys want to stay an extra day when a girl slumber parties,
you should,

1740
01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:01.880
that you need to see man has become legal.
I sure hope you mark it out.

1741
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.370
It could be the fucking catch phrase.
Just you haven't seen God homie joy.
It was,

1742
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:09.080
I was saying about that guy who was saying May 21st is going to be the end of

1743
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:11.600
the world and was having all these billboards and God's coming and what were you

1744
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:14.540
going to do when God comes?
You can see God,

1745
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.890
you need seven grams of mushrooms and a quiet dark room and you can see God,

1746
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:23.891
you can see everything that anyone has ever thought of ever all at once.

1747
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:26.360
What's so cool about it?
It's like that's fucking with levels in your brain,

1748
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:28.100
right?
And maybe not.

1749
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:32.390
Maybe it's introducing an organic life form from another fucking planet that's

1750
01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:34.910
super intelligent and communicates with you through eating it.
Sure.

1751
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:36.500
But both of them are fucking mad.
I mean,
what,

1752
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:38.180
I guess what I'm trying to say is like both of them,

1753
01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:40.300
both of them might not be a good thing now.
No,

1754
01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:44.210
but mushrooms are an amazing point of them are just as magical because let's say

1755
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:46.670
which side?
It's just as manageable.
Both.

1756
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.670
It's either just your brain or if it's some other intelligence,
right?

1757
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.370
Because if it's your brain and that's what people,

1758
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.000
they're always kind of looking for.
It could be a hyper nutrient,

1759
01:28:55.001 --> 01:28:58.310
so I'm sort of a hyper mental nutrient,
so so far science has just,

1760
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.110
it fucks for certain parts of your brain,
right?
Well,

1761
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:02.190
they think it actually decreases a certain

1762
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.860
<v 4>amount of blood flow to certain areas.
Yeah,</v>

1763
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:07.650
but they don't totally understand that they need a lot of time doing it and

1764
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:10.960
there's some really cool people doing research,
but I you can't discount,
sorry.

1765
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.600
Getting to write about that.

1766
01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.120
You can't discount the subjective experiences and when people are actually

1767
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:17.420
getting from or how much they're,
they're gaining from it.

1768
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:21.420
Some psychedelic drugs have changed me as a human being.
Oh,
absolutely.
I mean,

1769
01:29:21.421 --> 01:29:23.010
I think they've changed most people who have done it.

1770
01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.430
What I think so cool is you can say it's a higher power or whatever,

1771
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:30.660
but it's even cooler to me to be like,
or it's me,
it's inside me.

1772
01:29:30.661 --> 01:29:35.060
It was my fucking brain is when you've had,
when you've had a real blow outs,

1773
01:29:35.061 --> 01:29:36.150
psychedelic experience,

1774
01:29:36.151 --> 01:29:39.690
the first thing that happens is you're taken to another place and you don't know

1775
01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:43.830
if that other places just some sort of a misfiring of synapses or if it is

1776
01:29:43.831 --> 01:29:44.970
actually another place.

1777
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.540
But what we do know is that the most potent chemicals are the ones that are

1778
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:52.950
produced by your own mind and the most potent ones in like eating mushrooms.

1779
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:57.120
Mushrooms are,
I think,
I forget the exact chemical term,

1780
01:29:57.121 --> 01:29:59.160
but it's like four or five bucks for a lock.

1781
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:02.670
Sully nn dimethyltryptamine I might've said that wrong,

1782
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:06.900
but the point is nn dimethyltryptamine is actually produced by the human mind.

1783
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:12.020
So this is like another form of this human neurochemical.

1784
01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:16.260
So there's like a human neurotransmitter and there's a mushroom that fucking

1785
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.830
mimics and add some other shit to it.
Yeah.
And when you take this,

1786
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:23.870
you have these incredible experiences and does nothing negative to your body.
No,

1787
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:27.810
for sure.
And you learn from it.
I agree with that 100% well,

1788
01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:29.370
I think you need to do some of that shit.

1789
01:30:29.371 --> 01:30:32.910
And then rethink this whole God thing because there might be some information

1790
01:30:32.911 --> 01:30:35.970
that you're not applying.
And I'm not saying there's God like the Christian Guy,

1791
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:40.500
I'm just saying there's probably an order to,

1792
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:43.510
all of the way I live,
the way I live is this.
I live like they're there.

1793
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:47.130
Like there is no god.
And so what that's done is,
and again,

1794
01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.590
you know you're not driving,
I live like there is no god.

1795
01:30:49.591 --> 01:30:52.140
Why not just live like you don't know because well,

1796
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.780
because I always want to because I always want to ask questions.

1797
01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:57.450
She would always ask questions and I think that's the key thing.

1798
01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.060
I think most people who do believe in God said there's definitely a God I would

1799
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:01.980
consider myself when I would you say there's definitely not.

1800
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:03.300
Why wouldn't you can't?
I would say,

1801
01:31:03.301 --> 01:31:05.360
right and I would say right now on this podcast,

1802
01:31:05.361 --> 01:31:08.070
if a fucking fist came through the ceiling and was like,
I've got,

1803
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:09.030
I wouldn't be like,
no,
you're not man.

1804
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.490
I've read Richard Dawkins like I'd be like check.

1805
01:31:11.491 --> 01:31:13.800
And I think that's the difference between science and religion is I bet you

1806
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:18.120
could below Richard Dawkins fucking socks off with a powerful DMT trip.

1807
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.430
I bet he would come back and he'd be like,
well,

1808
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.110
there's some new things to consider.

1809
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.220
He'd fucking sit down with his laptop and start writing a whole new book.

1810
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:27.420
That's what Graham Hancock did.

1811
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:32.100
It's all about dragons and cock was all about ancient civilizations and all this

1812
01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:35.940
different shit until he went to the jungle and took fucking the Iowasca with the

1813
01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:38.970
Peruvian shamans and all of a sudden he wrote that book supernatural.

1814
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.470
Or he believes that the entire human race has evolved from monkeys because of

1815
01:31:43.471 --> 01:31:46.800
psychedelic chemicals and that these chemicals are getting us in touch with some

1816
01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:50.040
sort of higher intelligence that figures the world out for us.
And that's,

1817
01:31:50.050 --> 01:31:53.040
that's how human civilization was formed.
I mean,
I think that,
I think that,

1818
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:53.671
I think the real,

1819
01:31:53.671 --> 01:31:57.060
I think that what's proven so far is just as trippy and just as fucking magical

1820
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:59.710
is that that we came from the fucking stars.
You know what I mean?
That we,

1821
01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.560
that we came from particles of stars that every child,

1822
01:32:02.561 --> 01:32:06.250
you can tell every child came from a fucking star and you look at the Big Bang

1823
01:32:06.251 --> 01:32:08.800
and you look at the chance that it took and you looked at the way we evolve

1824
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:11.080
using our,
using our brains and amazing physical prowess.

1825
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:14.140
I mean that shit to me blows my mind just just as much.

1826
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.290
That's because you've never done enough mushrooms.
I'm telling you man,

1827
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:20.740
there's a big fucking deal to you or does evolution?
No,

1828
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:23.530
it doesn't turn you against anything.
The,
there's clearly,

1829
01:32:23.531 --> 01:32:26.230
there's a process of things evolving and becoming.

1830
01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.290
You mean scientists don't like to use the term evolution for anything that

1831
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:32.340
doesn't include genetics,
but if you just look at social evolution.
Sure.
Look,
can,

1832
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:34.120
we were talking about before,
but we were,
you know,

1833
01:32:34.121 --> 01:32:35.800
we both give homage to Lenny Bruce.

1834
01:32:35.801 --> 01:32:38.380
Lenny Bruce is one of the pioneers of standup comedy.

1835
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:42.280
If it wasn't for Lenny Bruce,
really there would be no Jamie Kilstein.

1836
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:44.110
There'd be no George Carlin.
It'd be no,

1837
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:48.670
anybody who's out there really saying something on stage that you believe in

1838
01:32:48.671 --> 01:32:51.550
that may or may not be controversial or may go against the grain.

1839
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:53.060
He was the originator of that.
Right.

1840
01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.140
But going back and watching it now is like reading stale academic journals.

1841
01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.450
Interesting.
I'm not funny.
He's,

1842
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:03.000
he has a few funny lines that will come up with a name and we'll,

1843
01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.490
you can go around my house,
Dude.
I Have Lenny Bruce Posters.
Oh,

1844
01:33:05.491 --> 01:33:07.570
I concert is going of him being arrested.
Yeah.

1845
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:09.070
I've got his shit all over the place.

1846
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:13.000
I pay homage to Lenny Bruce [inaudible] with Bruce and with Hicks.

1847
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.970
There's a few of those guys.
You're not supposed to criticize.
You know,

1848
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.230
it's supposed to ever say anything.
And you know,
in remotely bad about that.

1849
01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.770
Even saying that their old stuff is not that interesting anymore.

1850
01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:24.240
But I think that's some sort of,
uh,
an,
uh,

1851
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:29.430
an evidence of this never ending comp complexity and never ending progress.

1852
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.600
And it applies to our culture.

1853
01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.820
And it obviously applies to the universe from the Big Bang to the cooling stars,

1854
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:37.210
to the single celled organisms,
to multicellular organisms,

1855
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:41.170
to life moving in some sort of a,
it's an,
it's a very obvious direction.
I mean,

1856
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:43.630
my whole deal is,
if you want to believe that,
I think that's amazing.

1857
01:33:43.631 --> 01:33:44.321
As long as you,

1858
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:47.500
which you don't stop as long as you don't use that as an excuse to stop asking

1859
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:50.320
questions and keep digging and Campbell,
why would you stop asking questions?

1860
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.080
You don't have to stop asking you questions to think that there's some,

1861
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.380
some sort of a hyper order to everything,

1862
01:33:56.381 --> 01:34:01.120
that there's some sort of loving energy and that positive energy is probably

1863
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:04.600
what this idea of God really is.
But I think that I,
I think that right now it's,

1864
01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:06.230
it's not,
it's almost like you're,

1865
01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:09.460
you're almost being too optimistic in the sense that a lot of people don't think

1866
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:12.490
that way.
You know?
I mean,
I knew addicts and I'm sure you did,
who,
you know,

1867
01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.280
went to fucking Aa and they would use a god.

1868
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:18.320
Every time they relapsed they would be like,
oh,
sure.
But higher power,

1869
01:34:18.321 --> 01:34:19.380
it is a different plan or I'm,

1870
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:23.560
I'm not really concerned with their errors and thinking what I'm concerned with

1871
01:34:23.561 --> 01:34:28.561
is the possible positive affects of thinking that there's some sort of a higher

1872
01:34:29.261 --> 01:34:31.330
power.
And I don't mean it in a,

1873
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:34.780
in a sense of one person or one deity or one thing.

1874
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:39.220
I almost mean in terms of just that this dimension,

1875
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:42.390
as complex as it is a supposedly,
you know what is,

1876
01:34:42.391 --> 01:34:44.970
you're supposed to be 11 dimensions are something that can be proven.

1877
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.680
Quantum physics.
I don't even know what that means.

1878
01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:50.950
I'm just talking out of my ass and that none of us can fucking even visualize

1879
01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.150
that.
But I guess what I was saying is like,

1880
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:57.350
if you have you and Brian Wright and like Brian's being a good person and,

1881
01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.310
<v 3>and living his life and,</v>

1882
01:34:59.311 --> 01:35:03.380
and loving like everything you said because he loves his family because he loves

1883
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:06.890
eating his girlfriend's ass hole because he lives,
uh,
you know the podcast.

1884
01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:09.530
He loves his life,
he loves nature around him.
He loves all that stuff.

1885
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.830
And then someone else is doing it.
And again,
this isn't what you're doing,

1886
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:15.290
but for a lot of religious people just talking about finding the positive and

1887
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:18.050
God they do it either because they want to go to heaven and be able to eat a lot

1888
01:35:18.051 --> 01:35:20.870
of pancakes and see their dead fucking cat or they do it because they're afraid

1889
01:35:20.871 --> 01:35:23.510
to go to hell.
Who's really living the more pure life.

1890
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.970
I think it's the person that's doing it for the,
in the moment,

1891
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:27.260
for the right reasons,
for the person.

1892
01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:29.930
They love real life as opposed to the people who were doing it because they're

1893
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:33.320
either scared or they're trying to kiss God's ass.
Yes,
I agree.

1894
01:35:33.321 --> 01:35:37.820
I think we agreed on that.
Um,
I think we all need to be very careful of,

1895
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:39.860
and I have friends who are atheists that will,
you know,

1896
01:35:39.861 --> 01:35:40.790
they will like give me this.

1897
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:44.450
There is no god conversation like Penn Jillette is one of those dudes.

1898
01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.700
He will give you.
There is no god and you know,

1899
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:49.430
and I've never had a drop of alcohol in my life.
You know,
he doesn't drink.

1900
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:52.350
He doesn't do drugs.
I do anything.
I'm like,
the reason why you saying that,

1901
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.310
that's cause you never done any drugs,
right?
If you did some fucking DMT,

1902
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:58.370
you would have some goddamn questions.
You would come back and you'd go,

1903
01:35:58.371 --> 01:36:00.140
how was that right there?
How did that happen?

1904
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:04.850
Or how is it that I can take this stuff and I am transmitted instantly to some

1905
01:36:04.851 --> 01:36:09.851
place that is beautiful beyond my fucking wildest imagination and filled with

1906
01:36:10.281 --> 01:36:13.620
energy and information.
I think all of that shit should be investigated.

1907
01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:16.520
And I think the answers could be incredible.
We don't know.

1908
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:18.060
That's the bottom line.
We don't,
we,

1909
01:36:18.061 --> 01:36:22.750
we are a fucking a Gnat on an ant's ass trying to figure out the universe.

1910
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:26.440
But if we don't accept that we're crazy having more fucking idiots and were

1911
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:28.250
temporary,
we know that we end,

1912
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.950
we end and we want to pretend that we have it figured out.

1913
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.350
Leave your fucking mind open,
man.
This could be nuts.
You know,

1914
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:37.310
I don't think it is a man in the clouds with the harp and angels,

1915
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:41.060
but all the Shit that I've seen on mushrooms that's way less crazy.

1916
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.500
And I imagine if that's all it was,

1917
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.560
if you got there and they're really wants a gate and a dude with a fucking a

1918
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:49.220
thing,
like a book that shows all the Shit you did.
I sit down,
he's like,

1919
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:52.010
are you feel bad about that?
Dot.
I feel terrible.
I evolved.
I grew.
Okay,

1920
01:36:52.011 --> 01:36:54.140
come on in.
Yeah.
There really is a fucking guy like that.

1921
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:56.700
That wouldn't be as weird as some of the shit that I've seen you on.

1922
01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.730
Psychedelics is that reason I always pictured a,

1923
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:01.640
if there was a guy to being the dad from the Little Mermaid,
I don't know why.

1924
01:37:01.641 --> 01:37:04.410
Like that's always the fucking name of dance from the Little Mermaid shows that

1925
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:08.420
weird fucking guy with the big beard and the whole crowd.

1926
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:12.530
Although he had a fan,
so I don't know how I'd explain that.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.

1927
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:17.050
The the underwater Dad Titan,
I think it is.
I think it's king tide

1928
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:19.810
has involved somewhere

1929
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:23.850
<v 5>there's,
there's synthetic drugs that do the same as like certain drug,</v>

1930
01:37:23.851 --> 01:37:26.010
like you can probably make a synthetic mushroom.

1931
01:37:26.011 --> 01:37:29.600
I'm sure that that there is that where you take the same chemicals in it and

1932
01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:30.800
they say the same thing

1933
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.700
<v 3>besides silicide.
When there's silicon,
there's,
there's several different,</v>

1934
01:37:33.730 --> 01:37:37.000
different psychoactive substances that exist in mushrooms.

1935
01:37:37.001 --> 01:37:39.370
So if you want it to get the exact effect of mushrooms,

1936
01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:42.820
you would have to make an artificial one,
right?

1937
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:44.860
Wouldn't be as simple as just a suicide,

1938
01:37:44.861 --> 01:37:46.300
but you would have to have it in the exact,

1939
01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600
the way it interacts with the silicon and the weather.

1940
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:50.830
They interacts with a bunch of different shit inside of it.
It's not,

1941
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.110
it's not just one thing.
Yeah,
I think

1942
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.610
<v 5>it's synthetic pot and stuff like that.</v>

1943
01:37:56.611 --> 01:38:00.510
And it opens up certain things in your brain that makes you see things and you

1944
01:38:00.511 --> 01:38:03.030
can consider that as like,
like that's like a religion.

1945
01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:05.070
That's a guy that cause your,
your bodies,
you know,

1946
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:08.730
your brain's reacting to this drug and you can even do it synthetically or you

1947
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:11.620
can pick it off the ground.
So I think that that,
that,

1948
01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:14.560
that whole concept is probably like,
you know,

1949
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.750
psychedelics might not be anything other than that.

1950
01:38:18.751 --> 01:38:22.920
Your brain reacting to something crazy up,
you know?
But if anything,

1951
01:38:22.921 --> 01:38:25.770
I think of what it's interesting that died.
If it does do something,

1952
01:38:25.771 --> 01:38:29.390
it's probably has something to do with just using parts of your brain that I

1953
01:38:29.391 --> 01:38:30.500
have never been used using it

1954
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:32.740
<v 4>before.
That to me is so fucking cool.</v>

1955
01:38:32.741 --> 01:38:35.080
The fact that we use show little of our brain,
it's like,
wow,

1956
01:38:35.081 --> 01:38:37.110
how do we tap into the fucking arrest of it?
Yeah.

1957
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:40.180
It doesn't have to be a god like what's fucking up here that we haven't even

1958
01:38:40.181 --> 01:38:43.930
fucking seen before?
Like that blow his mind.
Here's what we absolutely know.

1959
01:38:43.931 --> 01:38:48.040
We absolutely know that we exist in some sort of a state right here and right

1960
01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:50.230
now and that we know that this state,
this physical state,

1961
01:38:50.231 --> 01:38:52.980
that we all exist and we can experience it.
I,
you know,

1962
01:38:52.981 --> 01:38:54.850
I think therefore I am and you knock on wood,

1963
01:38:54.851 --> 01:38:58.600
it's right there when you have the psychedelic experiences,

1964
01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.390
what it may be doing in,
in,
you know,

1965
01:39:01.391 --> 01:39:05.830
it may may be doing by blasting your brain with all these thoughts and ideas.

1966
01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:10.980
It may be pushing evolution or pushing progress into a certain direction.

1967
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:14.980
And that may be the very code of the universe itself.

1968
01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:19.960
That may very well be the idea of love and God is that exist in,

1969
01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.070
in promise.

1970
01:39:21.071 --> 01:39:24.940
It exists in potential in certain substances that interact with the brain in a

1971
01:39:24.941 --> 01:39:29.140
very positive way that makes life move forward in a positive direction.

1972
01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.510
So in a sense,
it is connecting you with God,

1973
01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:35.950
but in a sense that God doesn't really exist.
The God is an idea.
The God is,
is,

1974
01:39:35.951 --> 01:39:39.550
is,
uh,
as a potential.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
It could easily be that.

1975
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.520
It can easily be that there's something positive about it though.

1976
01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.080
And that's also why it's illegal.

1977
01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:46.990
That's why Charlie Sheen's girlfriend had to go down to Mexico to get that.

1978
01:39:46.991 --> 01:39:51.400
I begin cleaning itself up off that crack.
Uh,
yeah,
she was,

1979
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:54.160
she was called a crack pipe recently.
She said it was a weed pipe,

1980
01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:57.850
but come on bitch and just smoke weed and then go get some Ibogaine treatment,

1981
01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.260
you know.
Sure.
Come clean.
She's going down to Mexico to get this,
uh,

1982
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.120
this incredible psychedelic drug.

1983
01:40:04.121 --> 01:40:07.630
That's illegal in America has an incredible rate of curing addiction way better

1984
01:40:07.631 --> 01:40:08.950
than doctor drew.
Oh Wow.

1985
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.350
<v 5>I've been running into a lot of people lately that have been,
uh,</v>

1986
01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.000
putting cocaine on weed lately.
Whoa.
Who the fuck you were hanging out with?

1987
01:40:16.001 --> 01:40:19.900
The strippers friends,
man.
He's an asshole and quiet dark rooms and,
no,
no,
no.

1988
01:40:19.901 --> 01:40:23.530
These are people I've met at comedy clubs.
Really?
They're like,
hey man.
Yeah,

1989
01:40:23.531 --> 01:40:27.810
this is late.
Or a club.
Like audience members.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.

1990
01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:31.450
They've always told me,
but it's happened maybe twice.

1991
01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.840
<v 4>I love that.
Hey,
you know this,</v>

1992
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.780
you know this weed that used to kind of open your mind and make you sort of more

1993
01:40:35.781 --> 01:40:39.260
creative and funny.
You want to add complete shaky paranoia to,

1994
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.840
how about some fucking sweat night terrors,

1995
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:47.330
the dripping sweat off Satan's ball sack race,
your joint with it.

1996
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.880
I don't smoke weed that people is,
we try to get smoked weed and me,

1997
01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:54.460
I know a friend who was also a very famous fellow that got dosed

1998
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:54.850
<v 3>alright.</v>

1999
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:57.250
And he smokes and we with somebody and there was something in it that wasn't

2000
01:40:57.251 --> 01:41:01.330
weed and he was fucked up for like a day and a half.
So that's it.
I'm done.
Sorry.

2001
01:41:01.331 --> 01:41:05.290
I wish I good.
That happened to me when I,
when I was a kid I want to move.
Was it?

2002
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.650
Ah,
ah,

2003
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:11.330
so I either think it was crack or I think it was uh,

2004
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:12.490
one of our,

2005
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:16.750
one of our sober x dragging users tweeted when I described the story on the show

2006
01:41:16.751 --> 01:41:21.050
and they thought it was some kind of like a involvement in bombing tech smoke

2007
01:41:21.051 --> 01:41:21.884
shirt.

2008
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:26.560
And I remember just like taking a hit with this shady kid on my porch and then

2009
01:41:26.561 --> 01:41:29.310
he was just like pretty cool about it.
He was like,
by the way,
man,

2010
01:41:29.311 --> 01:41:32.440
this may maybe late.
And I'm like,
oh,
that's why I feel like I'm going to die.

2011
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.960
<v 5>Mike.
And I knew,
yeah,
I didn't do read for</v>

2012
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:38.340
more I think than we think.

2013
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:40.950
Like I think there's like these ghetto guys that are playing place,

2014
01:41:40.951 --> 01:41:43.140
they was like,
dude,
this shit's better than regular weed.

2015
01:41:43.141 --> 01:41:46.290
I put some balm and fluid on it.
Let's get Joe Rogan hot.
You know,

2016
01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.200
like I think it's like someone's just telling us that someone was trying to get

2017
01:41:49.201 --> 01:41:51.380
them high with her coked up joint.
Yeah,
it's,

2018
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:54.420
it's more than we think because that it's happened to me twice in the last
month.

2019
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.140
Think

2020
01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.560
<v 3>about drugs like that is like,
so I like,</v>

2021
01:41:57.561 --> 01:41:58.880
I stopped drinking and stuff cause I don't,

2022
01:41:58.881 --> 01:42:02.000
I don't do it well and a and having them,
just a few people do.

2023
01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:08.090
There's something bad,
biggest failure rate as far as people would do it.
Correct.

2024
01:42:08.091 --> 01:42:09.890
You know what I fucked in when I stopped drinking.

2025
01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.620
Literally a month later I started making a living as a comedian and I was like

2026
01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:16.280
so much.
You tell people that drinking is bad,
it has negative correlations.
Well,

2027
01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:17.540
it's terrible for your energy,

2028
01:42:17.541 --> 01:42:21.290
but it is great for having a good fucking Todd show what he wants to be that

2029
01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:25.070
Paul Newman and the hustler or he'd down bloodshot and makes that trick shot and

2030
01:42:25.071 --> 01:42:28.280
wins all the money in the bar and walks out.
I everybody wants to be that guy.

2031
01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:29.640
I could really handle his liquor.

2032
01:42:29.641 --> 01:42:32.310
So they're like Paul Newman if they're just so I can like hit his wife and just

2033
01:42:32.311 --> 01:42:35.360
like kind of a sad or Paul near event.
No,
they don't want that.
Paul Newman.

2034
01:42:35.410 --> 01:42:38.270
But he did grab Piper Laurie in that movie and Shaker,

2035
01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.960
which was really not alone.
Oh,
but I'll just say like,
so with the,
with the weed,

2036
01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:42.950
with the coke and weed,

2037
01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:46.100
like that's so interesting to me because someone is saying with their body like,

2038
01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:48.800
okay,
so I want to get high.
Right,
but that might make me too tired.

2039
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:50.780
So then I got to balance it out and get coke.
And it's like,

2040
01:42:50.781 --> 01:42:55.190
so are you just smoking yourself back to normal?
It's like you were fucking fine.

2041
01:42:55.191 --> 01:42:58.370
You were literally,
you were that and now you're just doing that.

2042
01:42:58.371 --> 01:43:02.660
But it's addictive.
But my friend Johnny was a crackhead.
He actually died.
I mean,

2043
01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.760
he'd had a bunch of different things that used to do,

2044
01:43:04.761 --> 01:43:06.860
but he was my best friend in New York.
And he would,

2045
01:43:06.861 --> 01:43:09.560
he would always smoke crack and he'd tell me he'd smoke coke,
smoke crack,

2046
01:43:09.561 --> 01:43:10.394
like whatever he get.

2047
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:14.300
And he would have to drink 40 ounces to calm himself down cause he would get to

2048
01:43:14.301 --> 01:43:17.630
the point where he was sweating and his heart was beating a hundred miles a

2049
01:43:17.631 --> 01:43:21.800
minute and he had a drink 40 ounces to denormalize them.
Right.

2050
01:43:21.801 --> 01:43:23.600
And you're just like,
well maybe if you know,

2051
01:43:23.601 --> 01:43:28.520
if he just didn't smell it because apparently the way it was explained to me by

2052
01:43:28.521 --> 01:43:31.710
my friend Steve,
who's an addiction specialist and he used to work and,

2053
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.830
and try to work in treatment centers is you fire up that dopamine and you fire

2054
01:43:36.831 --> 01:43:41.040
up those levels when you do the coke and then your shit crashes and you're in.

2055
01:43:41.041 --> 01:43:45.110
It's such a depressed state that if you don't like fire it back up again

2056
01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.750
artificially.
You like feel terror and fucked up his,

2057
01:43:47.751 --> 01:43:51.170
I remember and a lot of people don't like know stuff like that because the at

2058
01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:52.230
five HTP,

2059
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.940
<v 4>well the first time you smoked crack apparently it's horrible.
It's fucking,</v>

2060
01:43:55.941 --> 01:43:59.570
you just feel like the worst you've ever Fuckin felt yet you go back because

2061
01:43:59.571 --> 01:44:03.400
it's that addictive Brian Smoke crack.
It was just like doing cocaine.
Now,

2062
01:44:03.401 --> 01:44:04.650
me and my friend got back wreck

2063
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:12.530
all of these fucking lame crack dealers out there.
Honestly,
it was just like,

2064
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.480
oh yeah,
that was just like,
that was correct.

2065
01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:18.940
So I wanna I to switch gears before we end this thing because um,
there,
uh,

2066
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.450
you're,
you're out here and you're,

2067
01:44:20.451 --> 01:44:24.090
I'm meeting with managers and you know Jamie Kilstein,

2068
01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:26.180
it's like one of these hot young comics.

2069
01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:29.060
It's like you can make a noise out there and there's a bunch of people looking

2070
01:44:29.061 --> 01:44:31.190
at you trying to see if they can make some money off him.

2071
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:35.660
I watched this movie called overnight.
All right.
Do you ever seen overnight,

2072
01:44:36.710 --> 01:44:39.380
overnight is based on the guy who made the boondock saints?

2073
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:43.120
I literally just had this conversation last night.
Have you seen it?
No,

2074
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:46.640
but I got the full fucking synopsis from my friends from Derrick comedy the

2075
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.100
other night.
Oh my God.
Somebody brought it up.

2076
01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.860
Somebody brought it up on the message board.
I just said,

2077
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:54.560
I don't know where somebody had boondock saints as their,
um,

2078
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:58.010
their screen name and they said something stupid that I didn't agree with.

2079
01:44:58.130 --> 01:44:59.960
So I just correlations correct.

2080
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:03.950
So I just wrote boondock saints was a fucking terrible,
you know,

2081
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:07.010
and then of course people were like,
well,
it's no zookeeper.
I'll dare you.

2082
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:13.610
But she'll keep her head,
heart,
motherfucker.
Those animals are cute.
I'm talking.

2083
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.670
So then this guy goes,
have you seen this documentary on the guy who made it?

2084
01:45:16.671 --> 01:45:18.650
And like,
I have the documentary,
I have it at home,

2085
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.060
but it never bothered watching it.

2086
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:23.810
But I pressed this youtube clip and I started watching it.
I said,
what the fuck?

2087
01:45:23.811 --> 01:45:24.980
Let me just see what this is all about.

2088
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:29.600
That I'm hooked immediately hooked yet it is amazing.

2089
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.450
It's a guy who,
well,
first of all,

2090
01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:35.210
his own friends made this documentary.

2091
01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.650
He was so full of himself that he thought that he was going to document this

2092
01:45:39.651 --> 01:45:44.060
rise to power at the boondock saints.
We all need to make that very clear.

2093
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.110
The boondock saints were ever even made and no one knew how bad it was.

2094
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:51.470
This guy was a bartender at this fucking place in Hollywood,

2095
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:56.180
and he was like this tough guy from Boston smoking cigarettes talking about
shit.

2096
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:59.750
And Harvey Weinstein bought his Weinstein.
Weinstein.

2097
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:02.960
Whoever it is is a bad motherfucker.
You don't fuck with them.

2098
01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:07.790
I learned that from this movie.
So this guy starts talking mad shit.
He's gonna.

2099
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:09.950
No one's ever been in a position like this before.

2100
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:13.630
We get the number one fucking band,
the country,
the number one fucking movie.

2101
01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:15.410
It's in project work know.

2102
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:20.590
So apparently all of his Braggadocia snus and cockiness and eventually turned

2103
01:46:20.781 --> 01:46:24.530
Harvey Weinstein off and he told me to go fuck himself and he canceled the

2104
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:27.680
project.
Give me back some of my money.
Go it.
We're not making your movie.

2105
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:32.300
And the document,
the movie,
the documentary details,

2106
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.540
this guy who was like completely thought he was the shit on top of the world.

2107
01:46:37.551 --> 01:46:39.770
Treating people like,
you know,
he's a fucking like,

2108
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:41.210
he's just the baddest motherfucker.

2109
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.840
He's going to own Hollywood to everything falling apart to all these people

2110
01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:48.820
turning on him and him turning on them and was screaming in his band members.

2111
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:50.130
Apparently.
That's what was so great

2112
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.790
<v 3>is first of all,
if anyone doesn't know what movies Harvey Weinstein has made,</v>

2113
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.350
it's all of them.
It is.
He made every movie that's ever made every mirror.

2114
01:46:57.351 --> 01:47:00.780
It's like one of those dudes like I'm not a movie buff.
I know I like movies,

2115
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:02.820
but if you say Harvey Weinstein,
you,
Oh yeah,

2116
01:47:02.821 --> 01:47:05.040
well that guy's one of those bad motherfucker dude.
It's like he has,

2117
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:08.010
he has a list somewhere of that blessed we were talking about,

2118
01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:12.060
he knows mercenaries.
That's who he is.
Oh,
for sure.
Actually.
And uh,
and so,

2119
01:47:12.061 --> 01:47:15.180
but what my friends were telling me is that what's so funny is so the friends

2120
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:17.790
are making this documentary and he's a,
he's a cut to the friends too.

2121
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.480
So as the movie progressed,

2122
01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:23.130
you slowly realize that the friends figure out what this movie is going to be

2123
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:25.070
and now it's going to be about this guy's breakdown.

2124
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.140
And apparently they just start kind of pushing them a little bit and just poking

2125
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:30.360
a little bit and that they push him and poke him.

2126
01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:33.990
It seemed like he knew the cameras were rolling and he didn't have to do it.

2127
01:47:33.991 --> 01:47:34.501
That's to me,

2128
01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:37.650
what was the most spectacular thing about that level of self awareness?
I mean,

2129
01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:39.480
and we meet people like this every day,

2130
01:47:39.481 --> 01:47:41.940
whether it's they're just a cocky fighters,

2131
01:47:41.941 --> 01:47:45.400
are there other comics who were just terrible but socog and it's just like I,

2132
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:49.340
I've never understood that mentality.
Like when you have that level of denial or,

2133
01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:53.300
or ego or nurses might block out everything,

2134
01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:56.780
a time move obsession.
It's an obsession with incorrect thinking,
right?

2135
01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.360
And this incorrect thinking is reinforced by all these people's adulation.

2136
01:48:00.361 --> 01:48:02.940
So you get really confused and you start thinking that's the correct way to

2137
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:04.860
think.
And still you're smoking cigarettes,

2138
01:48:04.861 --> 01:48:06.210
talking about what a bad mother fucker you,

2139
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:09.540
our boys were together were the brood and they're doing shots together and it's

2140
01:48:09.541 --> 01:48:13.860
just Douche baggery on a level that's like you cringe while you're watching your

2141
01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:16.610
toes curl up,
right?
Here's some of the things he says.
And he goes,
oh,

2142
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:18.630
and also you,
you say,

2143
01:48:18.670 --> 01:48:22.200
if you say thank God it wasn't me who was in his situation because I might have

2144
01:48:22.201 --> 01:48:26.310
done the exact same thing and his time in his life with his life experiences

2145
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:29.730
because people nowadays or it's like they don't think like entourage is as much

2146
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:32.490
as I fucking television show or was it just like a something to strive to be,

2147
01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:34.920
you know what I mean?
Just to be that level of fucking famous and,

2148
01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.030
and the problem,
I think you're right about the hang around there,
there,

2149
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.600
there was a,
there was a pretty famous comic who,
uh,

2150
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.970
who I was doing the show without in Australia.

2151
01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:45.150
And it was the first time I saw a comic with an entourage.
And,
and,

2152
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:47.610
and I don't think it was the entourage,
like doing shit for him,

2153
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.270
but every interview,
so like before the taping of the show,

2154
01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:53.960
we all did like a little press around and we're like,
we'd go to each interview,

2155
01:48:53.961 --> 01:48:56.490
we're and just do an individual thing and you'd just do it by yourself and you

2156
01:48:56.491 --> 01:48:59.800
have to deal with a stupid fucking report or a new try to be like,
Huh.
And,
uh,

2157
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.661
pretend you don't hate them.

2158
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:02.370
And then you move on to the next guy and do the same thing.

2159
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:05.850
And this dude with his entourage came and did the interviews with him and would

2160
01:49:05.851 --> 01:49:08.910
literally give him applause.
Brakes.
Whoa.
He's walked around and they were like,

2161
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:13.120
Yay,
give up his name.
Uh,
it's,
uh,
well I'm not gonna,

2162
01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:17.460
I'm not going to use the names,
but if I was,
I would do it in the movie phone,

2163
01:49:17.461 --> 01:49:19.230
voice,
and then the Arnold Schwarzenegger voice.

2164
01:49:19.231 --> 01:49:24.050
And then my name would be Pablo Francisco [inaudible].

2165
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:29.340
And,
uh,
and the weird thing was I talking to him backstage,
pretty nice,

2166
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.770
you know,
like Super Nice.
But it's just like when you get to that level of,

2167
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.440
he's crazy though.
You can't talk to him sometimes.
I love that guy,

2168
01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.170
but like we were outside of the company store ones and him and I were having a

2169
01:49:40.171 --> 01:49:43.020
conversation and went over to Brian and go,
you go talk to Pablo right now.

2170
01:49:43.021 --> 01:49:44.550
It's absolutely impossible.
Glove,

2171
01:49:44.551 --> 01:49:47.950
a conversation with them and he goes up going on over here at

2172
01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:54.050
<v 4>this position.
And that's the thing is,
you know,
he,</v>

2173
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.760
he doesn't seem like a bad guy,
but was when you went,
when you get to that level,

2174
01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:00.810
when people just say,
hey man,
you're always funny.
Hey,
keep doing the voices.

2175
01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:04.360
And I'm almost like slowly like retards you back down to like,

2176
01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:06.790
you're almost like a kid if you're only,
you know,

2177
01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:08.490
I think the people that stay humble or the ones like,

2178
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:11.290
I had a shitty life growing up.
I didn't have fucking a lot of friends.

2179
01:50:11.291 --> 01:50:14.140
I didn't have whatever.
So when you start to get things,
you really appreciate it,

2180
01:50:14.141 --> 01:50:16.060
you know what I mean?
And I think everyone needs that.

2181
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:18.290
Everyone needs to work fucking retail once in their life or when he's talking

2182
01:50:18.291 --> 01:50:20.650
shit on,
everyone needs to go on a fucking road trip and break down.

2183
01:50:21.370 --> 01:50:24.770
I believe in Jujitsu.
That's also why I believe and I believe in,

2184
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:26.650
in performing standup comedy,

2185
01:50:26.651 --> 01:50:29.870
that's also a thing at humble instantly Jujitsu.

2186
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:32.380
Does martial arts do pull those?

2187
01:50:32.381 --> 01:50:35.600
I love the game pool because a ball either goes in or it doesn't go in.
It's,

2188
01:50:35.601 --> 01:50:38.680
it's very difficult to keep everything together and all on the stroking line.

2189
01:50:38.681 --> 01:50:39.491
That's what I love,
man.

2190
01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:43.630
You can be the typical dude and you have the top out in digits.
You can,
you know,

2191
01:50:43.631 --> 01:50:46.070
think you're a really funny guy and you go in front of that audience and then

2192
01:50:46.071 --> 01:50:48.740
you can try.
It doesn't work that instant.
Well,
especially if you,

2193
01:50:48.741 --> 01:50:52.240
if you don't respect them,
it's just like you don't respect an opponent.

2194
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:54.130
You know you can get caught in an arm bar real quick.

2195
01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.220
If you don't respect an audience,
you don't respect their attention span.
Man.

2196
01:50:57.221 --> 01:50:59.590
They can get to a point where we're like,
we don't like you.
And I'm like,
Shit,

2197
01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:02.680
I thought you liked me and I like to couple of minutes ago when you started off

2198
01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:04.750
pretty funny,
but now we don't like anymore.
Yeah man.

2199
01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:08.830
That's feel after every joke is like time started down start again and it's real

2200
01:51:08.831 --> 01:51:12.060
and every time you throw out a fucking special you do,
you do a special old,

2201
01:51:12.061 --> 01:51:15.250
that's an hour that's gone.
Now it's time for a whole new hour.

2202
01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:19.660
You better have evolved.
Was that the last question you think there is,

2203
01:51:19.661 --> 01:51:22.300
but it's just forcing yourself into a situation.

2204
01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:25.260
Louis C K is the best example of that and he,
you know,

2205
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:29.330
the way he described it was really kind of cool.
He said if you tomorrow,
uh,

2206
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:33.460
we're going to,
you couldn't use your material anymore.
You just had to stop.

2207
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:36.180
Would you just stop doing comedy if you could not use it?

2208
01:51:36.181 --> 01:51:38.650
It was absolutely impossible.
For whatever reason,
whatever stupid reason,

2209
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:40.300
I'm already know you wouldn't stop doing comedy.

2210
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:41.400
You would just come up with new jokes.

2211
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:44.350
You said that and I started thinking of another like premise and like a panic.

2212
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:48.270
I'm just like,
why would I write about,
that's,

2213
01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:51.490
that's the pot lace coke have entertained the,
the,
the,

2214
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.320
the humility though is a huge factor.
But in Hollywood,
humility is,
um,

2215
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:59.890
it's,
it's one of the weird,
sort of a breeding ground for,

2216
01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.350
for Hubris and even in,
in,
in,
in,

2217
01:52:02.351 --> 01:52:06.460
and cockiness and people who are just really delusional man,

2218
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:11.540
because it's world of make believe because it's a world where the bad mother

2219
01:52:11.541 --> 01:52:11.921
Fucker,

2220
01:52:11.921 --> 01:52:16.720
all he has to do is be able to pretend he's a bad motherfucker when the cameras

2221
01:52:16.721 --> 01:52:19.810
are on.
It's not a real bad motherfucker.
It's a guy who,

2222
01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:23.700
there's writers and they've spent weeks formulating his dialogue,

2223
01:52:23.701 --> 01:52:25.930
do the absolute perfect economy of words,

2224
01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:29.190
and the music comes on when he's on screen and he gets all of that adulation.

2225
01:52:29.191 --> 01:52:33.160
It starts thinking he's the shit.
And it's,
it's the same thing with this,

2226
01:52:33.161 --> 01:52:34.540
this guy who was in this movie.

2227
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:38.500
It's the same thing with anybody that's a narcissist or anybody that's over the

2228
01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:43.330
top.
And then we feed into it.
You know,
it's like there was,
um,
there was this,
uh,

2229
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.310
whenever,
when we were,
when we were younger,
uh,

2230
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:49.070
<v 2>I'm a Hawaiian,
right?
And so would you stay?
We were poor,</v>

2231
01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:51.830
but we'd go to Hawaii to see family and stuff and a lot of times we would sneak

2232
01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:55.670
into these fancy hotels and this is 100% sure what you're sticking to these like

2233
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:57.770
fancy hotels and just kind of Beverly hillbilly it and say,

2234
01:52:57.771 --> 01:53:01.460
my dad was checking in and then would go like swimming pools and shit and a,

2235
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:04.490
you got to these places,
man,
and you stay there for long enough and you're like,

2236
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.180
uh,
the,
they get what everyone gets whatever they want,
right?

2237
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.800
No one's necessarily a dick about it.

2238
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.680
They're just used to getting whatever they want.
There's,

2239
01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:13.910
there's no danger around,
there's nothing to worry about.

2240
01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:18.290
And then you leave that area and then you see like for the first time,

2241
01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:20.450
no matter how good of a person you are and about how empathetic you are,

2242
01:53:20.451 --> 01:53:22.340
you see like a homeless person,
you and your first reaction is like,

2243
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:25.070
what the fuck is that?
Because you're just,
you're not used to it.

2244
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:28.400
You know what I mean?
We're in the resort and you're just surrounded by comfort.

2245
01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:31.550
Um,
and does that make you a bad person?
No,
but I,
I,

2246
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:35.000
you know what the one thing Obama did say that I really fucking like before,
uh,

2247
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:38.950
I voted for him and he destroyed everything that,
uh,
I believe then,
uh,

2248
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:42.320
was he said,
we have this country has an empathy deficit disorder.
Right.

2249
01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:46.070
And it's like a little play on words,
but,
uh,
but I think that's really true.

2250
01:53:46.071 --> 01:53:49.730
Like I didn't start to have empathy until I started to travel.

2251
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:52.400
And I remember when fucking prevents it brought me to China to open from when I

2252
01:53:52.401 --> 01:53:55.330
was younger and still like living out of my car.
I got to China,

2253
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:58.040
my first thought was,
I didn't know this was a real place.

2254
01:53:58.190 --> 01:53:59.630
Like obviously like I wasn't an idiot.
Like,

2255
01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:01.340
I didn't just think of it like a spot,
but to me it was just like,

2256
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:04.370
I knew what the shape of the map when I'd see the new stories,

2257
01:54:04.371 --> 01:54:05.810
but that's why you can watch,
you know,

2258
01:54:05.811 --> 01:54:08.820
you'll be watching day three of the earthquake in Japan footage and you're kind

2259
01:54:08.821 --> 01:54:11.660
of like,
there'll be part of you.
And I hate saying this,
that's like,
all right,

2260
01:54:11.661 --> 01:54:14.540
I get it.
There's a fucking earthquake.
Because like you've never,

2261
01:54:14.630 --> 01:54:18.170
you don't know how bad that shit is.
And once you see places,

2262
01:54:18.171 --> 01:54:20.270
once you meet people from other places,
I remember we did it.

2263
01:54:20.271 --> 01:54:23.780
I did a show in Oklahoma City and like there's a murder in Oklahoma city a

2264
01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.610
couple months later.
And my first I was,
oh my God,
I know a person there.

2265
01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.400
And I'm like,
I would've just blown off that fucking story otherwise.

2266
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.040
And like I think you just have to,
every time you're like,
oh,

2267
01:54:31.041 --> 01:54:33.620
why doesn't that fucking person get a job?
Just think about like,

2268
01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.360
if you don't have kids,
if you don't have a job,

2269
01:54:35.361 --> 01:54:37.820
how fucking scary it is to wake up every fucking morning.
Be like,

2270
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:39.500
do I look for a job?
Do I take care of my kids?

2271
01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:41.300
Do I pull my kid out of school to watch?
I mean,

2272
01:54:41.301 --> 01:54:44.540
there's so much shit that you just have to just shut the fuck up and just think

2273
01:54:44.541 --> 01:54:47.000
about what it's like to be that person.
I mean,

2274
01:54:47.001 --> 01:54:50.420
that's really what I think it comes down to you for just being like decent.

2275
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.190
You just have to have fucking empathy.
That's it.

2276
01:54:52.690 --> 01:54:57.400
<v 4>It's definitely easy to lose your perspective if you're in a resort all the</v>

2277
01:54:57.401 --> 01:54:57.790
time.

2278
01:54:57.790 --> 01:55:02.440
Or if you're some Hollywood douche bag that got handed a half a million dollars

2279
01:55:02.441 --> 01:55:05.830
from some huge production company to make your first film and you really start

2280
01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:08.260
believing you are the shit.
Even though had people talk to me this week,

2281
01:55:08.261 --> 01:55:11.810
I'm just like,
that's not a real sense.
You don't believe when you're on,

2282
01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:13.990
you're in the grooming stage,
you're in,

2283
01:55:13.991 --> 01:55:16.570
you're in the stage where people are looking at you and they're,
you know,

2284
01:55:16.571 --> 01:55:17.890
they're courting you.
Yeah.
You know,

2285
01:55:17.891 --> 01:55:20.170
they're trying to see if they could make some money out for you.

2286
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:23.450
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
I mean like,
yeah.
It's one of those things where it's like,</v>

2287
01:55:23.451 --> 01:55:26.000
I feel like we were talking about like what's selling out is,

2288
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:29.240
and I think that I think that as long as you're saying what you want to say,

2289
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:29.870
if you know,

2290
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:34.870
if I make $1 billion going after these fucking giant corporations and uh,

2291
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:38.070
you know,
not compromising and attacking the Democrats and Republican,

2292
01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.530
like I deserve that billion dollars.

2293
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:44.060
[inaudible] how are you going to make the billion dollars though?
You

2294
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.680
<v 3>know what I'm saying?
I mean,
in the most hypothetical situations,
the show so far,</v>

2295
01:55:46.710 --> 01:55:48.840
it's what are you doing?
You know,
if you're doing something you don't like,

2296
01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:51.660
you know what the biggest,
the feeling of selling out for me ever was,

2297
01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:54.990
was doing a bad sitcom.
When I did a hardball,

2298
01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:59.580
I had never been more miserable performing work then performing a bad sitcom.

2299
01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:00.390
It was,

2300
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:04.050
it's when you're reading shit that you know is really bad and the audience is

2301
01:56:04.051 --> 01:56:06.570
not laughing and you're forced to do it over and over again and you know it's

2302
01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:08.550
going to be on TV.
That's when you're like,
wow,

2303
01:56:08.551 --> 01:56:11.570
this is unfulfilling and has nothing to do with the CIC common.

2304
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.590
It was the fact that creatively it was a bad sick.

2305
01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:15.850
I'm newsradio funny fucking set comp.
Yeah,

2306
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:19.650
well I got really fortunate and I went from worse possible scenario to best

2307
01:56:19.651 --> 01:56:23.970
possible scenario in a row.
But what it made me think was like,
okay this ride,

2308
01:56:23.971 --> 01:56:26.820
it's too fucking crazy.
I want to get off like the Sitcom ride.

2309
01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:28.710
It's like you're either feast or famine.

2310
01:56:28.711 --> 01:56:31.290
You either have brilliant writing or you have dog shit.

2311
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:34.970
And I did some guest spots on some shows that weren't so hot and I,
you know,

2312
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:36.510
read some scripts that weren't so hot.

2313
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:39.080
It's like there's a lot of lot of bad shit out there.

2314
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.100
Previews on TV I saw pretty good for the uh,
the one where like fucking end,

2315
01:56:44.101 --> 01:56:47.740
Jason Bateman and Green Lantern Piss into a fountain and then they change

2316
01:56:47.741 --> 01:56:51.420
because one's a family man.
I'm one.
Oh yeah.
What the fuck is that?

2317
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:52.620
And it's literally someone walked in.

2318
01:56:52.621 --> 01:56:54.330
It's the exact same plot of all these other movies.

2319
01:56:54.331 --> 01:56:57.170
But the twist is like the pest in a fountain and it shows you,

2320
01:56:57.171 --> 01:57:00.570
I will show was you and you see that movie.
Have you seen that ad

2321
01:57:02.090 --> 01:57:02.970
that's making fun of itself.

2322
01:57:02.971 --> 01:57:06.480
It's like a hot tub time machine now that's the whole point they're taking.

2323
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:11.370
That's kind of what it is though.
It doesn't look funny enough to,

2324
01:57:11.371 --> 01:57:14.190
to for them to take credit for that.
But what I was gonna say,

2325
01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:17.220
so I mean take any fucking bad movie example.
Right?
What's so funny?

2326
01:57:17.221 --> 01:57:19.650
So you look at it and your first thought is that looks like a shitty movie,

2327
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.100
but then you think about how much money was spent.
Someone wrote it,

2328
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:26.070
someone wrote a first draft and was like pissed it a fountain.

2329
01:57:27.450 --> 01:57:31.190
You know the movie that I just did,
man,
there's fucking talking animals.
You know,

2330
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.970
there's no reason why they talk and there's a code.

2331
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:35.340
They're not supposed to talk in a differences.
It's a kid's movie.

2332
01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:37.680
You know the kids might be is really,
it is ridiculous.

2333
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:41.220
The idea that you can fucking just sell the fact that what no rock came from

2334
01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:44.160
outer space.
Now all sudden they can talk.
No,
they just always talk.

2335
01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.860
Someone pitched it to someone that someone went through,
someone edited it,

2336
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:50.400
some Wa,
you know what I mean?
Like they pissed in a fountain.
They shouldn't be.

2337
01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:52.620
There shouldn't be a scene where after they pitched it and found one of them

2338
01:57:52.621 --> 01:57:55.140
goes,
what's we pissed in the fountain and now we switched roles.

2339
01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.180
That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.

2340
01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:59.960
They do what the movie's about.
It actually says it like that.

2341
01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:03.060
Actually I get looks good.
I'm going to get,
you're trying to trick us.

2342
01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.560
By the way,
he's famous for not researching things.

2343
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:11.400
You'll not going on Google right now looking for the quotes.

2344
01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:14.350
I think even in the trailer they say like it's a

2345
01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:19.920
stupid joke.
There's movies man,
where you just see the movie and you go,

2346
01:58:19.921 --> 01:58:23.610
I wish I was there while they were making this like showgirls.

2347
01:58:24.570 --> 01:58:29.350
That must've been a cocaine rampage movie.
People got rejected from that.

2348
01:58:29.351 --> 01:58:31.770
When people auditioned and people audition and then we're like,
oh,

2349
01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:34.740
I didn't get into fucking showgirls.
Like I mean like there was so much.

2350
01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:35.731
But then conversely,

2351
01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:38.580
the good news is then every once in a while something like the wire gets made or

2352
01:58:38.581 --> 01:58:40.530
something.
Yeah.
And those pitch meetings to me or even more,

2353
01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:43.690
it makes more sense to me that whoever made the zookeeper can walk in and be

2354
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:45.520
like talking to animals,
Kevin James Redundant.
They're like,

2355
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:49.560
here's a million or $1 billion.
And then they let them use the monkey.
Yeah,

2356
01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:52.480
it makes less sense to me that someone fucking pitch to Wally.
Right?

2357
01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:53.830
Someone went in there and was like,
all right,

2358
01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:55.990
so it's going to be anti corporation is going to be pro environment.

2359
01:58:55.991 --> 01:58:59.200
Here's the twist.
No fucking dialogue for like the first hour.

2360
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:00.310
It's just a fucking robot.

2361
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.830
But you can tell his personality through his eyes and someone was like,

2362
01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.420
all right,
we'll do it,
or the,
or.

2363
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:08.350
Let's make a show that actually makes drug dealers a complex and makes cops are

2364
01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:10.210
bad sometimes.
And here's the twist,

2365
01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:13.060
not that many gunfights and it makes violence look disgusting.

2366
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:15.880
Someone fucking took a chance and made it,
you know what I mean?
So cool.

2367
01:59:15.881 --> 01:59:19.090
Shit's still can't happen,
but as sort of seems to happen,

2368
01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:22.040
if nobody fucks with it,
that's the,
that's really the thing I was,

2369
01:59:22.041 --> 01:59:25.010
I lose some shows are good.
Yeah.
Perfect example.
It,

2370
01:59:25.011 --> 01:59:28.300
it has to come from an individual point of view.
You know,

2371
01:59:28.301 --> 01:59:31.280
when I was talking to Anthony Bordain,
if you've ever watched the show notes,

2372
01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.420
I know,
I know the show that show,

2373
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:36.400
this is a show that Mark Marin tried to cock block me on.
But uh,

2374
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:37.600
it's a brilliant show.

2375
01:59:37.601 --> 01:59:41.800
But one of the more brilliant aspects of it is that it comes from an individual

2376
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:42.634
point of view.

2377
01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:47.500
It comes from one man who has a passion in view of,

2378
01:59:47.501 --> 01:59:50.650
of food and of the world and of exploring all these different cultures.

2379
01:59:50.651 --> 01:59:52.900
And it comes from him.
He's narrating in,

2380
01:59:52.901 --> 01:59:56.710
he's writing things down and that that is missing,
man,
that you,

2381
01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:58.900
that individual unique point of view.

2382
01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.080
And there's far too many times where any project gets started.

2383
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:05.620
And too many fucking people have a vision of how this thing should be.
Yeah.

2384
02:00:05.670 --> 02:00:09.020
You know what I mean?
Your audience may,
it may,
this may get a little cheesy.
I'll,

2385
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.500
I'll be really need to tell you this.
One of the funniest thing.

2386
02:00:11.501 --> 02:00:13.270
So we were having trouble getting in touch this weekend.

2387
02:00:13.271 --> 02:00:16.720
Could you were away and I was traveling.
We were both traveling and uh,

2388
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:19.420
I remember I was like,
I'm not really sure if I'm doing the show.

2389
02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:24.250
And then yesterday suddenly I got like 200 new Twitter followers and I go to

2390
02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:27.700
check my mail on.
The first one I see is legalized weed is now following you.

2391
02:00:27.701 --> 02:00:31.500
And I'm like,
Oh,
I'm doing Joe's podcast.
Uh,

2392
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:37.700
but uh,
but w w what's really,
what the fuck are we talking about?
God dammit.
Um,

2393
02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.680
we the the Oh yeah,
the,
yeah,

2394
02:00:41.890 --> 02:00:45.940
the single person being in charge.
Um,
what's,
what's now called,
I forgot

2395
02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:48.800
<v 5>Cecil B demented.
Have you ever seen it?
Check out?</v>

2396
02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:53.200
This is an old school movie from the past where the projectionists of this movie

2397
02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:56.530
theater got so tired of like Hollywood movies and stuff like that.

2398
02:00:56.531 --> 02:01:00.610
So they ended up like kidnapping,
like everyone and making their whole movie.

2399
02:01:00.611 --> 02:01:02.830
It's pretty,
it's a John Waters Film.
It's pretty out there.

2400
02:01:02.831 --> 02:01:07.090
But it's kind of like about the,
you know,
the old independent,
you know,

2401
02:01:07.091 --> 02:01:08.890
one person's vision or at least,
you know,

2402
02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:12.240
<v 3>well,
I've seen it in when we try to do the man show,
you know,</v>

2403
02:01:12.241 --> 02:01:14.650
when you have too many people from networks and you know,

2404
02:01:14.651 --> 02:01:17.580
if too many people from the production side of it trying to give their own

2405
02:01:17.581 --> 02:01:22.170
opinion,
change things,
it's,
it's very hard to get an individual like,

2406
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:25.290
like what South Park does because they're so successful.

2407
02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:27.390
And these and these and these motherfuckers too.

2408
02:01:27.391 --> 02:01:30.690
Like you're doing a standup special and you have someone trying to edit you

2409
02:01:30.691 --> 02:01:33.390
right in charge of content and someone's pitching you,
you know,

2410
02:01:33.391 --> 02:01:36.580
instead of saying pussy say this,
it's not another fucking comic.
Is that you?

2411
02:01:36.590 --> 02:01:39.680
It's a goddamn lawyer.
Right.
It's a fucking lawyer.
They don't about comedy.

2412
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:41.470
They don't anything about jokes.
But I was going to say,
uh,

2413
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:44.840
before is that I feel like with stand up,

2414
02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:47.990
especially the edgiest thing you can do nowadays,
you know,

2415
02:01:47.991 --> 02:01:51.800
people do think you're edgy by,
by,
by dropping the fucking and word or by,

2416
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:54.440
or we're using the faggot.
Are we making a rape jokes or whatever.

2417
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:57.110
The edgiest thing you can do is be fucking honest.
You know what I mean?
Do you,

2418
02:01:57.130 --> 02:01:59.120
I just think I think you can do is be like vulnerable.

2419
02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:01.430
You can do all those things,
but like you watch these old comics,

2420
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:05.110
none of them will ever fucking tell them about like a fear they have or sometime

2421
02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:08.780
they fight.
It's all this fucking detached sort of like,
oh well look,

2422
02:02:08.781 --> 02:02:09.680
I have a chart.

2423
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:12.530
So that makes me different because I'm the guy with charts and it's just like,

2424
02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.550
just fucking who are you?
You know what I mean?
Just stays on me fucking honest.

2425
02:02:16.551 --> 02:02:17.150
And I,

2426
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:19.860
I really do think nowadays that's the edgiest thing you can do is just be on,

2427
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:21.350
have your own fucking point of view.

2428
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:25.460
How'd that come from a Twitter follower thing where you get there?
Oh,

2429
02:02:25.461 --> 02:02:28.070
the Twitter follower thing.
I think I had a long time ago and then a pop that

2430
02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:34.210
it came from.
I know you tried to see the trail.
It came from boarding.

2431
02:02:35.010 --> 02:02:37.220
I think it came from Brew Day in and just when you were saying having your own

2432
02:02:37.221 --> 02:02:40.610
point of view and I'm like that is a lot rarer and comedy than it should be

2433
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:41.720
because that's what companies should be.

2434
02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:44.680
It's hard to really have an individual point of view,
you know?

2435
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:47.270
I mean you have to really fucking think things through and you have to have some

2436
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:49.180
personal sovereignty.
There's three still.

2437
02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:51.950
I always say in my opinion there are three steps to comedy.

2438
02:02:52.130 --> 02:02:55.610
Step one is when you first started now and then you do whatever you think works

2439
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:59.750
terrifying to be onstage bomb half the time I tried to be Jim Norton.

2440
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:03.140
Did you really?
Yeah,
I used to listen to opie and Anthony a lot and uh,

2441
02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:08.000
I was just like so and now what?
Talking about rape and anything with Jim,

2442
02:03:08.001 --> 02:03:11.150
what I didn't realize about Jim that makes him so good is Jim's not after gym.

2443
02:03:11.151 --> 02:03:12.770
All of the,
especially cause I was in New York,

2444
02:03:12.771 --> 02:03:15.530
all of the people who want it to be like Jim Norton would just be like blah,

2445
02:03:15.531 --> 02:03:18.380
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
The prostitute was in my car.
And like that's,
you know,

2446
02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.870
that's kind of the punchline was like I fucking killed her.
And it's like,

2447
02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:21.670
all right.

2448
02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:24.470
But what's so cool about Jim is Jim was doing that on his vulnerable thing that

2449
02:03:24.471 --> 02:03:26.450
we were just talking about where he was saying like,
no,

2450
02:03:26.451 --> 02:03:29.840
this is a fucking problem.
And that's what made it so different.

2451
02:03:29.841 --> 02:03:32.480
It's this was his addiction.
This was something that he couldn't fucking stop.

2452
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:34.190
And then he was filthy and funny on top of it.

2453
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:37.490
But that's the difference is it was something personal on top of the fucking

2454
02:03:37.491 --> 02:03:38.990
filth.
And that's what made it so interesting.

2455
02:03:38.991 --> 02:03:43.040
So I think the first step is you just trying to say anything that will get a

2456
02:03:43.041 --> 02:03:46.370
reaction from the audience.
Right?
And then step two,
once you get a little better,

2457
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:48.500
he started saying things that you actually think are funny.

2458
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.720
Things that actually make you laugh.

2459
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.260
And then step three is when you get into the black gold shit,

2460
02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.330
that's when you start making fun of you start the concepts and ideas and you

2461
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:01.220
start bringing philosophy into the,

2462
02:04:01.221 --> 02:04:05.150
into the picture and you start having weird points of view that you figured out

2463
02:04:05.151 --> 02:04:06.970
a way to make funny,
you know,

2464
02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.170
and then you can introduce ideas into people's minds.

2465
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:13.370
Like when you said very good point earlier that conservatives can come up to you

2466
02:04:13.371 --> 02:04:16.400
after a show and say,
I didn't agree with you but you made me laugh.
Right?

2467
02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:19.490
But that's one of the most important things about being a standup comic is you

2468
02:04:19.491 --> 02:04:22.850
can introduce it and idea into the mind of someone who might not necessarily

2469
02:04:22.851 --> 02:04:24.590
have ever considered that before.

2470
02:04:24.591 --> 02:04:28.280
Just by doing it in a way that makes them laugh.
Because if you say something,

2471
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:30.590
you get onstage and you say,
I believe Blah,
blah,
blah,

2472
02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:32.930
someone in the audience is going to go,
well,
I kind of disagree.

2473
02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:36.680
I think this and that.
And you know we have an,
I have a point of view too,

2474
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.050
but if you say something and you make them laugh,
then they go,
ha,

2475
02:04:41.051 --> 02:04:43.380
and I'll agree with you,
but you're a fucking though.
It was pretty fun.

2476
02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:46.440
I got to consider it's the Machita kick.
You're just suddenly like,

2477
02:04:46.441 --> 02:04:49.220
what the fuck was that?
Oh yeah,
no,
we're cool.
It's fine.
Anyone of them.

2478
02:04:49.221 --> 02:04:52.950
A Cheetah kick is some fucking karate kid.
Bullshit all comes around,
man.

2479
02:04:52.951 --> 02:04:53.521
Now I was,

2480
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:58.230
the only thing that saved me from this whole Steven Seagal bullshit is I'm like,

2481
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:02.490
if junior dos Santos hits a fucking jump kick a hot bed,
I'm like,
all right.

2482
02:05:02.491 --> 02:05:05.490
It's like all,
you know what I mean?
Like Mochida all right,
fine.
But I'm like,

2483
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:08.280
if junior who I've never,
I don't even know if he like kicks.
I was just like,

2484
02:05:08.281 --> 02:05:13.080
if he starts to jump kick [inaudible] to his arsenal,
for sure he will,

2485
02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:16.020
but he doesn't.
I don't think he's training with those guys anymore.
Junior moved.

2486
02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:19.380
See,
that's the other thing that's weird about Jamie Kilstein.
He's a lefty,

2487
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:22.440
but he's a mixed martial arts fanatic.
Love is a Vegan,

2488
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:26.070
but he likes cage fighting.
How the fuck do you reconcile those things?
Well,

2489
02:05:26.071 --> 02:05:27.570
there's different,
I was telling,
I said,

2490
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:30.700
I was telling Ron this weekend that I was saying that,
uh,
you know,

2491
02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.750
one of my friends was like,
I want to go to a UFC event.

2492
02:05:32.770 --> 02:05:36.780
You think I'm gonna get into a fight?
And uh,
and I go,

2493
02:05:36.781 --> 02:05:40.920
the people you don't have to worry about are the big fucking dude screaming the

2494
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:42.300
ones in the tap out shirts.
They're fine.

2495
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:45.570
If you see a kid by himself reading a book with a Hoodie,

2496
02:05:45.730 --> 02:05:47.730
that kids that Hugh Jitsu,
he will fucking kill.

2497
02:05:47.731 --> 02:05:51.420
You see a little skinny guy with some fucked up ears,
stay away from him.

2498
02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:54.570
My brother has cauliflower ear and these two fuckers tried to start a fire with

2499
02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:56.310
him at a bar and he's really chill and it just kind of like,

2500
02:05:56.311 --> 02:05:57.840
you don't want to do that.
Like he's a,

2501
02:05:58.070 --> 02:06:01.820
he's a division one wrestler and like is like with Ricardo and made his team now

2502
02:06:01.821 --> 02:06:04.530
and,
and they were just like,
you fucking pussy was every cliche bar thing.

2503
02:06:04.531 --> 02:06:08.490
And then one of the guys literally just stared at his ears and just like stops

2504
02:06:08.491 --> 02:06:10.500
is that the French just like shut the fuck up,
shut the fuck up.

2505
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:12.860
And then they just walked away like the cauliflower ear.
Man,
that's fun.

2506
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:16.920
I'll look for that man can call me float you for the most part,

2507
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:20.130
he's probably wrestling a lot more than you are my friend.

2508
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:23.760
This get dominant Darcus uh,
he was a hilarious Improv guy from UCB.

2509
02:06:23.761 --> 02:06:26.870
We were talking about that yesterday because he doesn't get to two and a,

2510
02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:28.680
he was like,
even if the guy's not a wrestler,

2511
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.430
that means something else fucking dark end.

2512
02:06:30.431 --> 02:06:33.660
That means he took a fucking brick to the year or like he still does something

2513
02:06:33.661 --> 02:06:35.310
fucked up where that happens,

2514
02:06:35.311 --> 02:06:38.430
especially if they're both Jack's high now when you get the real fat one,

2515
02:06:38.431 --> 02:06:41.690
like have you ever seen what lean Ishmael and the leg,
they call him,
he's,

2516
02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:46.380
he's fucking ears.
It looks like a mouse with like a bullet hole in it.

2517
02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:50.190
That's what his ear looks like.
It doesn't even look like it's a real ear.

2518
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:54.960
It's so fucking fat and there's no,
you know,
this whole design of the ear,

2519
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:57.080
there's a reason for all that.

2520
02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.460
The sound comes in and it echoes off of that and it's,
it's,
you know,

2521
02:07:01.461 --> 02:07:03.720
it enhances everything.
He gets none of that shit.

2522
02:07:03.721 --> 02:07:08.240
He has a hole in the hole and this is big clump of,

2523
02:07:08.241 --> 02:07:12.150
of clotting.
Jesus is leading and hardening.
Ah,

2524
02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.180
they should be able to just chop it off,
throw a new year,
you know,

2525
02:07:15.181 --> 02:07:19.560
they can fix it.
They,
my,
my friend Brent had his fixed,
he,
uh,
he got too bad.

2526
02:07:19.561 --> 02:07:22.980
So they slice off the ear,
they pull it back,
they cut all the,
the,

2527
02:07:22.981 --> 02:07:25.860
the scar tissue and all the shit out and they put it back together and it looks

2528
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:28.860
reasonably good,
but it has real problems with some guys.

2529
02:07:28.861 --> 02:07:32.760
Dave terrail started getting some serious infections were,
uh,
his ears.

2530
02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:35.740
They had to take his ears off and then they had a quarter rocks.
Yeah.

2531
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:40.330
Cauterize inside his ear.
So you man,
that's why your guards bro.
Oh fuck.

2532
02:07:40.331 --> 02:07:42.970
With that regards.
That's why I don't worship God.

2533
02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:45.430
I will fucking a warship science when they're like,
might you rehearse like,
oh,

2534
02:07:45.431 --> 02:07:48.010
I'm just gonna take it off.
Going to pull the shit through fucked.

2535
02:07:48.011 --> 02:07:50.500
He's been fucked for over a year for this.
She spins.
It's really,

2536
02:07:50.501 --> 02:07:53.140
it's a really bad situation.
Yeah.
It kept him from fighting.
Yeah.

2537
02:07:53.141 --> 02:07:55.480
He's had a bunch of different operations.
She's the worst I've ever heard.

2538
02:07:55.570 --> 02:07:56.051
But soccer,

2539
02:07:56.051 --> 02:08:00.310
rob a lost is a year and a flight and you see that [inaudible] mom's keys hit

2540
02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:03.130
him and it's fucking ear.
Like literally it was hanging off.
Yeah,

2541
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:04.870
but that's because the zero is like a brick.

2542
02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:09.750
It's like there's a hard ass fucking piece of rock attached to the skin in

2543
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:14.130
Sakharova.
Man.
He's a guy that's been around for the longest time.
Yeah,
I'd Hey,

2544
02:08:14.131 --> 02:08:16.690
did you see the leave in Munios got assigned for today?
Yeah.

2545
02:08:16.691 --> 02:08:18.010
That's going to be in the UK that you can't,

2546
02:08:18.011 --> 02:08:19.990
people are pissed off about that fight.

2547
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:23.770
It took us a couple of pillar fun eyesight and killer fucking fly.

2548
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:28.240
A bunch of wine is obese.
Shit.
He caught of the hand the you came eight.

2549
02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:31.300
That's a great fight.
And who knows what the undercard is going to be,

2550
02:08:31.301 --> 02:08:33.780
but I guarantee it's going to be great to the,
uh,

2551
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:36.970
they try to make those UK fights is,
is exciting as possible.

2552
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:38.530
That's a good fight to me.

2553
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.080
She's a fucking killer and sick wrestler and,
and it's a monster now,

2554
02:08:44.081 --> 02:08:46.570
especially coming off that Vandelay Silva knockout like man,

2555
02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.390
never still was the leap Akiyama where it's like,
fuck you.

2556
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.700
It's the biggest fucking messy,
sloppy SLAAC fast.

2557
02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.650
And then it ends in a perfect triangle.

2558
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:58.780
Managing [inaudible] actually got to the point where he could rechallenge

2559
02:08:58.781 --> 02:09:02.800
Anderson Silva and if he actually made a fucking flight out of it.
Yeah.
You know,

2560
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:06.250
wild.
That would be,
man,
he never fucking know.
I mean,

2561
02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:09.160
I would imagine that if you watched that first fight,

2562
02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:11.200
the way he charged out after Anderson Silva,

2563
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:13.690
I would imagine if you put the two of them,
the octagon again,

2564
02:09:13.691 --> 02:09:16.510
he would never do it that way.
I'm sorry there.
We never fight that way again.

2565
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:20.560
That said,
Anderson is the most accurate guy that's ever fought.
I mean,
he's a,

2566
02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:24.700
he's a fucking assassin.
If there's openings,
he takes him,
you're fucked,

2567
02:09:24.701 --> 02:09:29.020
you get lit up.
I show any,
any of my fucking friends are fans who were like,
oh,

2568
02:09:29.021 --> 02:09:30.180
I'm really like boxing.
You know,

2569
02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.010
you show him both Don Frye staff and they can turn and be like,
oh,

2570
02:09:33.011 --> 02:09:36.040
the sweet science is for,
I just had the guy's neck just punch,
punch,
punch.

2571
02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:40.480
But you show him that Anderson Silva Forest Shit.
And,
and I mean every,

2572
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:43.600
you show it to anybody who doesn't know anything about fighting and they're
like,

2573
02:09:43.810 --> 02:09:44.980
oh,
that looks like a movie.

2574
02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.820
The Lieben fights the best example for me because that's what happens when a guy

2575
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:52.630
who's just wild and aggressive comes charging after guy who just going to call

2576
02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:56.430
assassin.
Yeah.
He's in the Matrix and he just nails him with everything.

2577
02:09:56.431 --> 02:09:59.440
It doesn't get hit with anything.
Nails done with everything.
Super accurate.

2578
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.490
And he does it with clinical precision.
Yep.
You know,
I'm,

2579
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.850
I'm very excited to see that.

2580
02:10:03.851 --> 02:10:06.640
I would love to see leaving versus a lot of guys right now.

2581
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:10.420
We've been after that Vandelay Silva knockout leap bins on fucking fire.

2582
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:13.150
I mean you gotta think he stumbled in the Brian Stann fight.

2583
02:10:13.151 --> 02:10:15.400
I give him a pass on that cause I knew he was sick.

2584
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.650
And Brian's stands up beast.
Anyway.

2585
02:10:18.651 --> 02:10:20.830
I'm sure you know Brian Stann can fuck you up dude.

2586
02:10:20.831 --> 02:10:24.400
If you get hit by Brian Stann,
Brian's stamped fucked up Santiago.
You know who?

2587
02:10:24.401 --> 02:10:27.640
Fuck up a lot of guys,
man.
These people are sleeping on stand on his rights.

2588
02:10:27.641 --> 02:10:31.840
Pretty Fun guy.
Brian.
Stan was in the shit.
Okay.

2589
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:36.050
He was over there with bullets flying through the air and smashing into people's

2590
02:10:36.051 --> 02:10:37.640
heads near him that,
you know what I'm saying?

2591
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:41.120
When you've been through that a regular fight,
like an MMA fight,

2592
02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:44.030
it takes on a totally different,
it's a totally different experience.

2593
02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:46.010
It's got to seem pretty easy.
It's like,
Hey,
you know what?

2594
02:10:46.011 --> 02:10:49.310
You can't do call on your friends to bomb me.
Yeah,
he can.
Yeah,

2595
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.570
he's him and Tim Kennedy's a few of those guys like Tim Kennedy,
special Kennedy.

2596
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:57.600
I heard the Fuckin at one really good guy and I love his fucking Jujitsu.
Yeah,

2597
02:10:57.601 --> 02:11:00.530
yeah.
That's for everything is standup's good.
His jujitsu's could.

2598
02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:04.090
But those guys mean you don't go from that environment,
you know,
to,

2599
02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:07.910
to cage fighting.
It's gotta be pretty easy.
It's a pretty easy transition theory,

2600
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:10.790
man.
The chairlift fights interesting though,
because,
uh,

2601
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:13.050
because it's jail channels a beast.
Yeah.

2602
02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.610
He's a serious wrestling and take away all his shit talking,
which is monumental.

2603
02:11:16.611 --> 02:11:18.280
He's the greatest shit talker that's ever existed.

2604
02:11:18.281 --> 02:11:23.281
That newest one was crazy with Ariel or with the Nogueira brothers when I was

2605
02:11:24.701 --> 02:11:27.580
gonna say I have about Anderson,
but he was,
he,

2606
02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:32.680
you think he beat me when a guy's beating your ass for four and a half minutes

2607
02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:37.490
and you wrap your legs around his head for eight seconds,
you think you won.

2608
02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.330
And what's so funny is you see that and you start laughing and you're like,
yeah,

2609
02:11:41.331 --> 02:11:43.850
fucking jail,
God.
Him.
And then you press stop and you're like,
oh yeah,
no,

2610
02:11:43.851 --> 02:11:46.710
he did one.
That's exactly what happened is he got you to tap out.

2611
02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.940
He's brilliant though.
It's not,
it's not based in reality.

2612
02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:53.090
It's just based in fucking theatrical.
It's the asics are incredible.

2613
02:11:53.091 --> 02:11:55.900
But I love about Anderson.
What's so cool about the UFC right now?
I,

2614
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:57.740
the reason I think it's the most excited and it's ever been,

2615
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:59.390
it's because you look at it,
a lot of the champion,

2616
02:11:59.391 --> 02:12:03.200
she looked at a lot of the people who have the most hype and they're doing the

2617
02:12:03.201 --> 02:12:06.500
craziest shit out there.
They're riskier shit.
Fucking John Jones.

2618
02:12:06.501 --> 02:12:08.330
You have Anderson,
you have Dominick Cruz,

2619
02:12:08.331 --> 02:12:10.990
you're half a Anthony Pettis got people were bad.
Hundreds.

2620
02:12:11.010 --> 02:12:14.690
I mean you have people who are just doing such new innovative.
Yeah.

2621
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:17.990
I mean that Carlos Condit fight man.
We just had him on the fucking show,

2622
02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:21.800
the full set of wine.
He was great.
Ah,
but cooler than the fucking flat.

2623
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:24.720
That butterfly sweep needs to be talked about more.
Fuck yeah.

2624
02:12:24.850 --> 02:12:27.930
That was the cause that he was in a truck,

2625
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:29.360
but that was the one place where it's like,
oh,

2626
02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:33.080
he's going to get light on him as a serious judo guy.
Yeah.
You're just like,

2627
02:12:33.081 --> 02:12:35.490
he's just going,
he's about to get sucked up now for the entire route.

2628
02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:39.320
He's against smaller team over easy mount and then trying for the gala.

2629
02:12:39.321 --> 02:12:43.550
200 is a beast.
Conduit is a fucking beast.
He's right there in the hunt.

2630
02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:45.290

2647
