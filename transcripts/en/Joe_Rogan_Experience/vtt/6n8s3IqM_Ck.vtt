<v Speaker 1>He started a fake university degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>mill,</v>

86
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say in some ways maybe it was</v>

88
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>fake or maybe it was just a precursor to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like Phoenix University of</v>

89
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but his real problem wasn't the school</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

91
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>they've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government never went after him and</v>

92
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running a scam school.</v>

93
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>The government went after him for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

94
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committing mail fraud and for um,</v>

95
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>a tax evasion was the big one because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes</v>

96
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>they felt otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he ended up in jail for um,</v>

97
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four years over that.</v>

98
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Well actually it was sentenced to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

99
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but then he claimed to be a drug addict</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he wasn't,</v>

100
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>never did drugs and they gave him some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off his sentence from enrolling in</v>

101
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>a drug treatment program.</v>

102
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.740

<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

103
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:47.860

<v Speaker 1>I wish I had that ability like my dad</v>

104
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

107

<v Speaker 1>like ceos of major companies that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>had degrees from Lasalle University.</v>

121
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Super successful even with fake degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly are not the only limiting</v>

125
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>factor in someone's competency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.720

127
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 1>something science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a different story.</v>

128
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't think he,</v>

133
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.603
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>

136
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>that's not the most egregious example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone being a con person.</v>

137
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

138
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chop your hands off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot you right in.</v>

153
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:39.950

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have a,</v>

155

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.840

158
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>His whole faith is ready to be shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm assuming there's a brain</v>

159
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>When everything else is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't project.</v>

166
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>You'll have some sort of a speaker on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside.</v>

167
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>There's so many veins and important</v>
<v Speaker 1>arteries that run around the neck here.</v>

168
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.520
