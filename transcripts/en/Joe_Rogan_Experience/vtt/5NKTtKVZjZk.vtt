00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the starfield ceiling they do,</v>

10
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>which is they put all these fiber optic </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights into your headliner and it looks </v>

11
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>like the stars and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 15 grand option,</v>

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but I bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>So bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only will they do it so you can </v>

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>get your standard star pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just whatever the guy,</v>

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>just random random lights or they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you exact constellations if you </v>

16
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.371
<v Speaker 1>prefer writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were one of those astrology </v>

17
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:52.371
<v Speaker 1>pdf or they will make you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>the sky directly above your house if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a coordinate,</v>

19
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of a bad ass bad ass.</v>

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

21
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you're balling so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were driving around with a car with </v>

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>stars in the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.231
<v Speaker 1>so the last thing I said before you hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>live was that they have just announced </v>

24
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>they have come out with a shooting star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how it works.</v>

25
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess you could do.</v>

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You can get shooting stars and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

27
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.261
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing a big lcd pattern or </v>

28
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:27.261
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess or I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can.</v>

30
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>You could have run on an led or a fiber </v>
<v Speaker 1>optic line that,</v>

31
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>that works in a kind of a train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

32
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:39.241
<v Speaker 1>I emailed once I got that press release </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get press releases and I just </v>

33
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:39.241
<v Speaker 1>delete them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

34
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw a shooting star ceiling,</v>

35
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.831
<v Speaker 1>I responded kind of further info in </v>
<v Speaker 1>video on this and they said they'd get </v>

36
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:45.831
<v Speaker 1>back to me.</v>

37
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So I've never even been in one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

38
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

39
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must,</v>

40
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like in there?</v>

41
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like sailing yachting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman had a really,</v>

42
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>really old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an old Bentley.</v>

43
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean like really like sixties old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

44
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>older than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 30 years old.</v>

45
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I paid attention to cars back </v>

46
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then it was when I just started</v>

47
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>getting on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't.</v>

48
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was broke,</v>

50
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I always loved cars when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I was broke.</v>

51
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>My attitude was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think about some shit you're never</v>

52
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to afford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just don't think.</v>

53
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan with all the toys somewhere to</v>

54
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:31.281
<v Speaker 1>park them somewhere to park them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had this old ball looking thing.</v>

55
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:36.411
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like something out of a citizen </v>

56
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:36.411
<v Speaker 1>Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

57
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Just this incredible boat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pontoon fenders,</v>

58
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

59
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.311
<v Speaker 1>Shifted it on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably I would say if I had to guess </v>

60
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>something ball or that Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would say Bentley,</v>

61
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>continental [inaudible] would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

62
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It might've been a candidate that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stunning automobile,</v>

63
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but he loved that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just have this giant smile on </v>

64
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>his face with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

65
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves cars.</v>

66
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil Hartman's bit like that.</v>

67
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember because like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said back then like if you asked me to </v>

68
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.080
<v Speaker 2>do like there's cars that I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit about like rolls royces or Bentley,</v>

69
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>but if you show me like an old porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

70
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a 73 long nose.</v>

71
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I know that we all have our areas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerdom,</v>

72
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>like muscle cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

73
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good muscle car guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understand most muscle cars.</v>

74
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you could pick them out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lineup,</v>

75
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.180
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

76
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Bentley and Rolls Royce were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a weird one because they have sort </v>

77
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.101
<v Speaker 2>of this intertwined history where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were separated and then they became </v>

78
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:35.101
<v Speaker 2>together and then they became separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

79
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:40.051
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of rolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Royce's and Bentley's that are mostly </v>

80
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>the same car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

81
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 2>that's like super baller level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you like,</v>

82
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>okay look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about it.</v>

83
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get a car that's makes no </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like you can't say anything.</v>

84
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Hoses are really amazing cause they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking cool.</v>

85
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine,</v>

86

<v Speaker 2>and even like to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of car guys,</v>

87
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 2>especially like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know you,</v>

90
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 2>you want your car to be like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to a race car.</v>

91
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I can be in dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gritty,</v>

92
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 2>like I wanna I wanna feel the rocks as </v>
<v Speaker 2>our drive over them for you would,</v>

93
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you would appreciate a Rolls Royce is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to make a hundred percent of </v>

94
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>that disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

95
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Like disappeared entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like there's really neat details.</v>

96
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you are the word flying or floating</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sailing is so true because you don't </v>

97
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:34.261
<v Speaker 2>really drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of fucking will it down </v>

98
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:34.261
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

99
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And you know how like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a porsche or a sports car will </v>

100
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>have like the thumb grips on the wheel </v>
<v Speaker 2>at night and three.</v>

101
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 2>So Rolls Royce has thumb grips at four </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eight.</v>

102
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You drive them?</v>

103
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Underhand gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extremely gangster under.</v>

104
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me try that.</v>

105
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Let me feel this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you.</v>

106
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's underhand.</v>

107
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't even lift your arms </v>

108
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Speaker 2>above shoulder height and then you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>your car has a tech commoner,</v>

109
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows you your Rpms.</v>

110
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Is there a rough indicator of how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>power you're using?</v>

111
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly?</v>

112
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.641
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before people go crazy about the </v>

113
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:14.641
<v Speaker 2>lack of a technical term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolls royces,</v>

114
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:19.021
<v Speaker 2>don't have tech amateurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a power reserve gauge which </v>

115
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:24.091
<v Speaker 2>shows you how much power the car has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you are not using at any given </v>

116
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

117
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>

118
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>if you're coasting along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at 100 going down a hill.</v>

119
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just off the gas off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brake,</v>

120
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 2>coasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

121
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Power Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're coasting,</v>

122
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you're using zero percent of your engine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is to keep that gauge low </v>

123
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 2>because you want to be able to pass cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cruise down the road while using 25 </v>

124
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.460
<v Speaker 2>percent of this car's engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

125
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>And they're stupid horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

126
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Like crazy bomber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Like not like crazy crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like for four to 500.</v>

128
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

129
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

130
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

131
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that funny that saying that it's </v>

132
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 2>not that hard for car of today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our standards are so crazy blown out.</v>

133
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Our standards or the Internet has fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>us all up.</v>

134
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You gotta understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about a new Miata,</v>

135
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>which by the way might be like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most underrated cars ever.</v>

136
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.930
<v Speaker 2>The new MIATA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lovely.</v>

137
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

138
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for the bang for the buck,</v>

139
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 2>for a fun little car to drive that Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>has real nimble.</v>

140
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 2>That's around their fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was only like a hundred and 50 </v>

141
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>horsepower that's there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the new Miata.</v>

142
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 60 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like,</v>

143
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you hear that and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

144
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know there's a company in </v>

145
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Colorado called Flying Miata,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know them,</v>

146
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where I'm going with this.</v>

147
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put an ls three in one of these.</v>

148
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 2>So I drove on that has a 575 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>ls three and it's fucking great.</v>

149
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>That must be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

150
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's got these long legs,</v>

151
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a little car,</v>

152
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's got the corvette long legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your third gear's good for like 90.</v>

153
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

154
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're driving a car like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the balance fucked up by then?</v>

155
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually similar weight it,</v>

156
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

157
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I think the ls conversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

158
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like maybe that's the older </v>

159
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

160
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>that they do it to a newer one as well.</v>

161
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like a few extra pounds in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front,</v>

162
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 2>but actually they have to use the rear </v>
<v Speaker 2>differential from a Camaro.</v>

163
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:40.091
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the extra weight goes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and so the cars maybe a hundred </v>

164
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.880
<v Speaker 2>pounds heavier with the v eight in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

165
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's four times the weight of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Miata,</v>

166
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.330
<v Speaker 2>like 2150.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That so like.</v>

167
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And then you see that that thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture was called an extra set which is</v>

168
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exoskeleton thing that says flying </v>

169
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.331
<v Speaker 2>me out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is an interesting photograph </v>

170
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:01.331
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

171
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 2>podcast people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to two vehicles on a track </v>

172
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.291
<v Speaker 2>from flying me out of the one in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a an exoskeleton car with really no </v>

173
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 2>body work on it at all and that's called</v>
<v Speaker 2>an excess set and so what is,</v>

174
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:16.481
<v Speaker 2>you buy that chassis and you buy a Miata</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you take apart the Miata and you put</v>

175
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 2>all the Miata shit on this chassis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you end up with a 1200 pounds things </v>

176
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 2>and you can put turbos and you can put </v>
<v Speaker 2>vh and you can do all different kinds of</v>

177
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

178
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it street legal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

179
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>it is street legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>car legal.</v>

180
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>And then the thing is called a bower cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

181
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you say carb legal like as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a missions?</v>

182
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

183
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you use a car legal,</v>

184
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.620
<v Speaker 2>like the Iraq engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

185
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>like John Ward likes or the stock Miata </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine for sure.</v>

186
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you use a carb legal engine,</v>

187
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's California legal.</v>

188
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've driven them there fast,</v>

189
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:56.651
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not nothing about excess sets design </v>

190
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 2>should be taken from this statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel safe in them.</v>

191
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to insult or the open.</v>

192
00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

193
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 2>it's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like having a body around me,</v>

194
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's way safer than a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

195
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>But a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this.</v>

196
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>A motorcycle offers an experience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be replicated and if you are </v>

197
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 2>going to take the kind of risks involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in riding a motorcycle,</v>

198
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.280
<v Speaker 2>that experience is kind of worth it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

199
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 2>to me in short bursts.</v>

200
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I don't think the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving a car with no body on it is </v>

201
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>worth you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think teachers either,</v>

202
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 2>but fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can get a lot of awesome car</v>

203
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.130
<v Speaker 2>with bodywork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like the thrill of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles,</v>

205
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 2>like it is either you either have it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

206
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.750
<v Speaker 2>like you're either in a convertible or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a motorcycle and the,</v>

207
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.880
<v Speaker 2>and the leaning of courses is really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that thing any more thrilling </v>

208
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>than a regular convertible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

209
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

210
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not faster than all convertibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having the no,</v>

211
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.780
<v Speaker 2>the no roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

213
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you just feel connected to the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and you can go because it's </v>

214
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 2>so light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 2>you can use an a relatively mundane </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine and go very,</v>

216
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 2>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Imagine 1200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

218
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

219
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

220
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>and you put up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>

221
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 2>imagine a corvette engine in that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can do.</v>

222
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are crazy.</v>

224
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I dropped some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is dangerous.</v>

225
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I know you're one take video series that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do where you're kind of people let </v>

226
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>you drive their fucking crazy hot rods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No souped up cars.</v>

227
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wooh.</v>

228
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I've just retired from driving people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal cars.</v>

229
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw this.</v>

231
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.200

<v Speaker 2>this is these weird software guys built </v>

232
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>this thing in Reno that's called a test </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's actually got quite a lot more tire </v>

275
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:36.930
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

276
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I had a complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have that muscle car ass.</v>

277
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.350

<v Speaker 1>thing came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.080

<v Speaker 1>He bought it off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The guy that I sold it to thing hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been around.</v>

296
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great looking car that,</v>

297
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>that year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all those years,</v>

300
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.730

<v Speaker 1>of the hellcat is in that same kind of.</v>

301
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty close,</v>

302
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:42.241
<v Speaker 1>but I really wish it was the same size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hellcat is a hundred and 25 or 130 </v>

303
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>percent inflated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overinflated scale version of that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000</v>

313

<v Speaker 1>Was it $5,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

315
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 1>My reverse map doesn't go back that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

316
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I think like five to 6,000</v>

317
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:23.240
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be out of the question.</v>

<v Speaker 1>8,500</v>

320
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.780
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read.</v>

323
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Reevaluate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to reevaluate.</v>

324
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And four slash 26 Hemi Cuda.</v>

326
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go right above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was Jamie coming in with a dollar </v>

327
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking assault?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love winning the show for 2016 for </v>

328
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Twenty six Hemi Cuda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which year?</v>

329
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 77.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goodyear.</v>

331
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two years of my favorite year of 70 </v>

332
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 3>and 71.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy one and the same.</v>

333
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I think 70 one's got four headlights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two.</v>

334
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 also has the smaller grill face,</v>

335
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:06.730
<v Speaker 3>like the teeth are small in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I had.</v>

336
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I had a 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas 71 has the full real.</v>

337
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

338
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:12.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really more aggressive.</v>

339
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.590
<v Speaker 3>I think 71 might be a little bit better </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>

340
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't recall if one year is more </v>

341
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.451
<v Speaker 3>valuable than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy one I think is probably the </v>

342
00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are the results in Jamie window sticker?</v>

350
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my favorite look and any muscle </v>

351
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>cars in 1971.</v>

352
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just like this aggressive </v>

353
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 3>American some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is.</v>

354
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 3>That is about as fucking aggressive as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>grill can get.</v>

355
00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.900
<v Speaker 3>It's got a mouthful of teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a Barracuda really does </v>

356
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 3>actually fucking nailed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

357
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.270

<v Speaker 3>what they looked like back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

360
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 3>looks sting ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's still a little bit.</v>

361
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.850
<v Speaker 3>The works kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like a fucking Barracuda </v>

362
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:18.850
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does that.</v>

363
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.021
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it's going to get you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're not going to fix that guy if he's</v>

465
00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:38.421
<v Speaker 1>so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's driving a giant log down a public </v>

466
00:20:38.421 --> 00:20:40.410
<v Speaker 1>road 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look on the other side of the road.</v>

467
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at the marks like the log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

468
00:20:42.721 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>as I go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the mark of dirt like moving</v>

469
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.960
<v Speaker 1>back and forth across the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was easier to see the other way I </v>

470
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:51.960
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

471
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

472
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess he couldn't pick it up.</v>

473
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It looked too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I don't see how that's an </v>

474
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.271
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would he be so convinced that the</v>

475
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 1>log is going to stay attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain?</v>

476
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:11.821
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does he know about logs and </v>

477
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:11.821
<v Speaker 1>chains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 1>and he seemed like an advanced chain </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists in the specialty of logs.</v>

479
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Fucking assholes out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

480
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Dragging a log behind a car on a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>road has a big ass log to log,</v>

481
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

482
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That chain is not going to hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That law is going to bounce and go </v>

483
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.920
<v Speaker 1>through someone's fucking windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Man,</v>

484
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.890
<v Speaker 1>they got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't mine.</v>

485
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It was borrowed like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how long it is.</v>

486
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy and I mean now that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to like,</v>

487
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back in the video,</v>

488
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trail of whatever its leaves on the</v>

489
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like that trail.</v>

490
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I had noticed starting like a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like half a mile or so before that on </v>

491
00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:01.291
<v Speaker 1>the road and the trail is going back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth across both lanes of traffic and </v>

492
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple of signs down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy shit to.</v>

493
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 1>You mean you're making obstacles for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are driving,</v>

494
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're on a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on a motorcycle and you're </v>

495
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>coming around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing,</v>

496
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

497
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 1>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like date motorcycles don't want sand on</v>

498
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

499
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't.</v>

500
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And you're putting it on the road 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent with that smokers.</v>

501
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I also don't want to get clothes lined </v>
<v Speaker 1>by logs and chains and my buddy a wiping</v>

502
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:33.391
<v Speaker 1>out on a turn on some sand was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the major reasons why I was taking </v>

503
00:22:33.391 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle safety classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get my license and I was</v>

504
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 1>going to get me in a couple of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends for fear factor.</v>

505
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:40.190
<v Speaker 1>We were going to get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get motorcycles,</v>

506
00:22:40.191 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>a couple of guys at work there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>as things went on,</v>

507
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:45.490
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this couple.</v>

508
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

509
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 1>two of them went through with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two of US bailed.</v>

510
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Alonzo Boden is all about the bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bikes,</v>

511
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.060
<v Speaker 1>how many books he broke in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he broke his arm on a </v>

512
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>bike a couple years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he did.</v>

513
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

514
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>think it's a bad risk.</v>

516
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I ride a scooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a little Yamaha scooter that I </v>

517
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.641
<v Speaker 1>ride around Venice and running errands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going to my office and stuff like </v>

518
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>because I can lane split and it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes my life a lot easier.</v>

519
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm terrified.</v>

520
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I had a motorcycle and I wrote it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>canyons maybe four or five times.</v>

521
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem pushing a car,</v>

522
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit in the canyons.</v>

523
00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 1>But on a bike like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravel,</v>

524
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

526
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Motorcycle people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know what it's like to rehab from </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious injury and like I am just so not</v>

531
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:44.521
<v Speaker 1>into that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've had two back surgeries in </v>

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:53.330

<v Speaker 1>First one lasted 11 years and then my </v>

536
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>bad decisions led to it being reinjured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second surgery was fine.</v>

537
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the best shape now that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>counters are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about tendon issues,</v>

568
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 1>folks whose never had tendon issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had them until this elbow.</v>

569
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it on elbows before,</v>

570
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 1>but I did it smart and I didn't keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out this time.</v>

571
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I tried to meet head my way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>where I'm four months later it wasn't </v>

575
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 1>healed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow healing thing,</v>

576
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're slowly tendons.</v>

577
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any blood supply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got a bunch of shit.</v>

578
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the platelet rich plasma works so </v>

579
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>well because it just gets it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

580
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It's very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

581
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.130
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's I think the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect is what we're talking about is </v>

582
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.280
<v Speaker 1>those therabands and actually it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheapest twisty,</v>

583
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>a blue thing that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a big Avatar Dildo.</v>

584
00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And you hold it out in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had it with me and then he </v>

585
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:01.810
<v Speaker 1>twisted like that.</v>

586
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I hold it like this and then I </v>

587
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.710
<v Speaker 1>let it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

588
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>So I just got one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you like.</v>

589
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.020
<v Speaker 1>And when you do the untwisting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthens for,</v>

590
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my issue on the inside.</v>

591
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the outside so I go the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

592
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be.</v>

593
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:19.421
<v Speaker 1>There's another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll show they have diagrams with </v>

594
00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:19.421
<v Speaker 1>different things you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's different,</v>

595
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's just those kinds of muscles </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get strengthened a lot.</v>

596
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.640
<v Speaker 1>My muscles and my hands picking things </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and I'm doing chin ups in rows and </v>

597
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.750
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was never doing anything twisty.</v>

598
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So started to add that the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving I do isn't good for me.</v>

599
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For your back or my hands are for </v>

600
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:38.890
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's flux on my whole body.</v>

601
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you put a lumbar pad or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

602
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but most cars I drive have like real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sporty,</v>

603
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seats and</v>

604
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them I'm lucky enough to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustable lumbar Mercedes right now is </v>

605
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.860
<v Speaker 2>killing the seat game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes seed game is so fire.</v>

606
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just they um,</v>

607
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 2>they work with this spinal center in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

608
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To develop all their high end seats and </v>

609
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>the seats on the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the s class,</v>

610
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 2>the amg s class is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so ridiculous.</v>

611
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he,</v>

612
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:11.900
<v Speaker 2>they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

613
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.600
<v Speaker 2>So they have a simulated hot stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>massage function that works.</v>

614
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.860
<v Speaker 2>It's boss as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a nine zone massage seat in </v>

615
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 2>the s class coupe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while you're driving,</v>

616
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.700
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a hot stone massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference between a hot </v>

617
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>stone massage and a regular massage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The air pockets that get inflated,</v>

618
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:35.420
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

619
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like behind the seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leather.</v>

620
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 2>There's like these pockets of air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like old reebok pumps,</v>

621
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

622
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 2>We're going to pump them up and inflate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and deflate them in sequence to simulate</v>

623
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:51.411
<v Speaker 2>needing or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the Mercedes s class heats those </v>

624
00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:56.091
<v Speaker 2>pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're actually the not with hot </v>

625
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:56.091
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

626
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a thermal thing on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so gangster.</v>

627
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a hot stone massage.</v>

628
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 2>They took it to the next level they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

630
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And in fact I got the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like a $225,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and I got it for a week.</v>

632
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I drove it around a road trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this.</v>

633
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I ended up writing 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>words on the seat.</v>

634
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 2>The hot stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fit has the fans behind your neck </v>

635
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>that blow the hot air because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>convertible,</v>

636
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.610
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

637
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you got the convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

638
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the backseat there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

639
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for the front seat because that's </v>

640
00:28:35.541 --> 00:28:35.541
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

641
00:28:35.541 --> 00:28:37.430
<v Speaker 2>The front seats are just just </v>
<v Speaker 2>delightful.</v>

642
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is amazing that we are in the </v>

643
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.520
<v Speaker 2>zones six zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that we're in this time </v>

644
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.250
<v Speaker 2>where the technology has gotten to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>level where cars,</v>

645
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:54.290
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working so hard to improve upon </v>

646
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:54.810
<v Speaker 2>what is already ridiculous in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

647
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have you,</v>

648
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.770
<v Speaker 2>have you experienced any of this semi </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous stuff yet?</v>

649
00:28:58.771 --> 00:28:59.650
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

650
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised as intellectually curious.</v>

651
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Interested in cars that drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

652
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:09.381
<v Speaker 2>They can go fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not interested in a brief </v>

653
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:09.381
<v Speaker 2>experience into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

654
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she should be Pam,</v>

655
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.720
<v Speaker 2>but for the most brilliant mind cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those cars are going to take away our </v>

656
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:14.720
<v Speaker 2>right to Dr.</v>

657
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you should join the human </v>

658
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 2>driving association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>

659
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're beginning of starting a lobbying </v>

660
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 2>association for the rights of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers.</v>

661
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Will it sounds like a fucking goof right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

662
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

663
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.950
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

664
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Because this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we don't want to ever have is a </v>

665
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 2>situation where you summon your </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous pod and you say,</v>

666
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 2>take me to wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes,</v>

667
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

668
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you're not going there today because </v>
<v Speaker 2>some political situation.</v>

669
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:48.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government tells you the war on </v>

670
00:29:48.481 --> 00:29:48.481
<v Speaker 2>driving is here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick your side.</v>

671
00:29:48.481 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

672
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 2>An Rs America on the left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a sign.</v>

673
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be an older car by the career.</v>

674
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 2>A whale tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my nine slash 11.</v>

675
00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What years?</v>

676
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Your nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an 87.</v>

677
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Were built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a safari build.</v>

678
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

679
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.640
<v Speaker 2>so you're making it like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer rally cars.</v>

680
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

681
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

682
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:14.270
<v Speaker 2>the Kenya project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Lee keen is a reporter racing </v>

683
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.941
<v Speaker 2>driver and he built one for himself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the most glorious thing I've ever </v>

684
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:23.401
<v Speaker 2>driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's everything that you love about </v>

685
00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 2>a nine slash 11 applies to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on loose surface.</v>

686
00:30:26.501 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your car.</v>

687
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My car is going to look like that,</v>

688
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 2>although it will be a different color </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have a roof rack and it'll be,</v>

689
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 2>it'll be slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly different.</v>

690
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>That seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually is a Richard Tuttle build </v>

691
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 2>from England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a keen sofar k,</v>

692
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:48.511
<v Speaker 2>e n and you'll see closer to mine </v>
<v Speaker 2>tuttle's the guy that made a greencard.</v>

693
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>

694
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:53.480
<v Speaker 2>This is my video of driving lease car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

695
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

696
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

697
00:30:58.331 --> 00:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I was fatter there.</v>

698
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's just drifty woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversteer and,</v>

699
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

700
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.790
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rear engine kind of snapped back </v>

701
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 2>thing that everyone's all afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine slash 11.</v>

702
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.890
<v Speaker 2>The pendulum thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you get that when you slide and </v>

703
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 2>then it catches and comes back on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose surface.</v>

704
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 2>There's no catch a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you slide it,</v>

705
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have the scary snap back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just drifts in the gums back drift.</v>

706
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Lee,</v>

707
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 2>he's building the thing that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good to have a rear engine bias.</v>

708
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.120
<v Speaker 2>It is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the most controllable.</v>

709
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got four inches of extra </v>

710
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 2>suspension travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So La speed bumps,</v>

711
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 2>ruts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about this in Los Angeles.</v>

712
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:50.281
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to drive this rally car </v>

713
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:50.281
<v Speaker 2>around La?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

714
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:50.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

715
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not a race car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a street car.</v>

716
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a streetcar.</v>

717
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

718
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:59.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks like so much fun trying to </v>

719
00:31:59.161 --> 00:31:59.161
<v Speaker 2>get in the dirt.</v>

720
00:31:59.161 --> 00:31:59.161
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have so much desert here.</v>

721
00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have Mirage.</v>

722
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 2>There's trails like there's no speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

723
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to be honest.</v>

724
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Speaker 2>There's two videos that made me get </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interested in older porsches.</v>

725
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.250
<v Speaker 2>One of them was the Chris Harris build </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the tuttle and another one was you </v>

726
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.520
<v Speaker 2>driving that project?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nasty cough.</v>

727
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Joey seely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a local as well.</v>

728
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 2>That car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

729
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

730
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

731
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Just like get it down to the raw dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

732
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>He took everything out of that car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Richard Tuttle,</v>

733
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:30.160
<v Speaker 2>who did Chris's car in England is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rally,</v>

734
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>master.</v>

735
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

736
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.590
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a project nasty.</v>

737
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And there's joey who built it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also,</v>

738
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I love the little things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did make the exhaust come through the</v>

739
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:45.371
<v Speaker 2>rear bumper and those funky wheels on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact there's no carpeting and </v>

740
00:32:45.371 --> 00:32:49.631
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything inside was stripped </v>

741
00:32:49.631 --> 00:32:49.631
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

742
00:32:49.631 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 2>His instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his emotion engineering and that car has</v>

743
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:54.020
<v Speaker 2>been through a few changes since this </v>
<v Speaker 2>video has made.</v>

744
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 2>It looks a little different now that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed the wheels.</v>

745
00:32:56.271 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different wheels,</v>

746
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 2>different like stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different stuff,</v>

747
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that guy,</v>

748
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to be a part of this business.</v>

749
00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 2>BBI autosport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He left to go start his own business,</v>

750
00:33:06.801 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 2>emotion engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he is a master of chassis setup.</v>

751
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

752
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very,</v>

753
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>very impressive video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting video.</v>

754
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's not like the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower vehicle,</v>

755
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

756
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:23.621
<v Speaker 2>it was really light though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was I think how many horsepower did </v>

757
00:33:23.621 --> 00:33:23.621
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

758
00:33:23.621 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy five.</v>

759
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Three 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

760
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 2>it was fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not a slouch at all,</v>

761
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:32.861
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen what singer is doing now </v>

762
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:32.861
<v Speaker 2>with this air cooled engine?</v>

763
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy what you sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing of the price difference</v>

764
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:40.751
<v Speaker 2>between a nine slash 11 engine air </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooled engine that's got 200 horsepower </v>

765
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 2>versus one's got $500 and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

766
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exponential curve of Porsche </v>

767
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:48.910
<v Speaker 2>horsepower costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really scary stuff.</v>

768
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Stan was $250,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

769
00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

770
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 2>if you buy an engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an engine on a stand,</v>

771
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 2>you want that engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a porsche air cooled,</v>

772
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Speaker 2>so a porsche engine for a porsche that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is earlier than 1995.</v>

773
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm 300 horsepower is gonna run you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 40 grand and that's a ton of money</v>

774
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:16.751
<v Speaker 2>for not a lot of horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 horsepower will run you about 100 </v>

775
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 2>grand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 100,000.</v>

776
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:21.890
<v Speaker 2>That's an engine on a stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing else.</v>

777
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.030
<v Speaker 2>You want 500 horsepower out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor seawater and $50,000</v>

778
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.930
<v Speaker 2>just for the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the edge.</v>

779
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that sounds so crazy in </v>

780
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 2>comparison to other cars because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of techniques that you would use to make</v>

781
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 2>horsepower and other cars you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply to a porsche engine.</v>

782
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You're limited on displacement size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like you could shove like a </v>

783
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:47.711
<v Speaker 2>nine Liter v eight in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a four point two is about as big </v>

784
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 2>displacement as you can get in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

785
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's with like a stroker crank and</v>
<v Speaker 2>board out.</v>

786
00:34:55.071 --> 00:35:00.071
<v Speaker 2>So you're increasing both the length,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pistons move and the size of the </v>

787
00:35:00.071 --> 00:35:00.820
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

788
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>to get to the 500 horsepower mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to run some highly experimental</v>

789
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.440
<v Speaker 2>cylinder heads and singer to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Chris has been on the </v>

790
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 2>show recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's working with singer to develop.</v>

791
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a company called Williams that </v>

792
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.061
<v Speaker 2>has a formula one team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are developing the cylinder heads </v>

793
00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 2>for singer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Chris Harrison is a part of this.</v>

794
00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:27.460
<v Speaker 2>He's doing development driving for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

795
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Which is a good decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing decision.</v>

796
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Plus the videos will be epic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

797
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:37.811
<v Speaker 2>So most of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a four valve air cooled </v>

798
00:35:37.811 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

799
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.100
<v Speaker 1>which as far as I know has never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done before.</v>

800
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:42.540
<v Speaker 1>All your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your engine,</v>

801
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>my engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the are our two valve engines and,</v>

802
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing a four valve engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

803
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost a million and a half </v>

804
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the engine is 250 grand.</v>

805
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Custom cars or a million dollars.</v>

806
00:35:58.171 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that nuts?</v>

807
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want something next level,</v>

808
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it can easily be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emily knows Jamie,</v>

809
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 1>pull up that new singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 singer nine slash 11.</v>

810
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And the Williams Williams engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's green,</v>

811
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's got a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

812
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.760
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the Japanese gentleman who takes </v>

813
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:19.760
<v Speaker 1>those porsches and our web?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

814
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of that to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

815
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so our web is really interesting because</v>

816
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:28.221
<v Speaker 1>in Japan there's the singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's a God damn </v>

817
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:28.221
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous car?</v>

818
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it's an odd choice to </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially different.</v>

819
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Stop please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexy.</v>

820
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 1>That artificially differentiate like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way he's got the fender flares,</v>

821
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making him like he had a glue them </v>

822
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 1>on carbon fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole car is carbon fiber.</v>

823
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:48.891
<v Speaker 1>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they fake like they had like </v>

824
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:48.891
<v Speaker 1>extensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

825
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:53.661
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to disappoint you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is a rendering and not a </v>

826
00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:56.841
<v Speaker 1>picture of an actual car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far as I know he actual car does not </v>

827
00:36:56.841 --> 00:37:00.681
<v Speaker 1>exist and I think if I had to guess they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put those over fender lines on the </v>

828
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:06.801
<v Speaker 1>rendering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would specifically notice that </v>

829
00:37:06.801 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 1>they have widened it a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That standard would be if I had to guess</v>

830
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the final car may not actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seam there.</v>

831
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

832
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad if it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks amazing.</v>

833
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you make that bigger again?</v>

834
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy that that's not a </v>

835
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 1>photograph like a render.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost certain.</v>

836
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not a real car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost certain it's not a real car.</v>

837
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Hire little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong.</v>

838
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:35.901
<v Speaker 1>There could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be someone's screaming at </v>

839
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:35.901
<v Speaker 1>their whatever right now saying I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

840
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:39.921
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure reflections in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window in the last three years.</v>

841
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:42.370
<v Speaker 1>They're good at this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

842
00:37:42.371 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I play a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely believe it.</v>

843
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's so good.</v>

844
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

845
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 1>if they'd make a car like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

846
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:51.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a gorgeous car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

847
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And they will and it'll look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it may not have those seams.</v>

848
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty similar to what their car </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like wider.</v>

849
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:02.241
<v Speaker 1>Much different than the wider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one of those that might've been </v>

850
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>the best looking car I've ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

851
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It was a silver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a metallic silver,</v>

852
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 1>like a bright silver singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was online understated.</v>

853
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like Lori's damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you find that bright silver,</v>

854
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>a silver singer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen one in person before?</v>

855
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 1>A close dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind would be blown.</v>

856
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 1>They have at a minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum 45 or $50,000</v>

857
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.680
<v Speaker 1>of leather in one of those cars and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interior,</v>

858
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the leather work in the interior of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those cars is unbelievable.</v>

859
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Beyond anything from any manufacturer </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

860
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

861
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

862
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sexy motherfucker.</v>

863
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good looking car.</v>

864
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very,</v>

865
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 2>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about certain shapes,</v>

866
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain.</v>

867
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 2>What singer does is they distill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 2>the best of each generation of car into </v>
<v Speaker 2>one car.</v>

869
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 2>And so you're looking at a highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>idealized nine slash 11,</v>

870
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 2>but you can't exactly picture what came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from where and why.</v>

871
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gangster.</v>

872
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 2>And those folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those wheels,</v>

873
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just work like,</v>

874
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 2>especially that green car that we go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to that green card,</v>

875
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 2>they made them all they made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm real big on the green card,</v>

876
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 2>but the design works so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the Williams engine.</v>

877
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

878
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So scroll down Jamie the Williams.</v>

879
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

880
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.050
<v Speaker 2>so you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the air intakes.</v>

881
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 2>That's where your rear windows would be.</v>

882
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 2>So there are no rear windows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are only those air intakes that go</v>

883
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 2>directly into the engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

884
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:36.690
<v Speaker 2>That furnace off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

885
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not cooling.</v>

886
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the actual air intake to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the combustion chamber.</v>

887
00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

888
00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

889
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 2>The cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's air cooled,</v>

890
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>so you see that silver kind of nipple on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right side there.</v>

891
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the center of the fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets cooled in from the back.</v>

892
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:56.011
<v Speaker 2>They're like this is basically the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>size as a regular inline six flats.</v>

893
00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:39:56.711 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Roughly that the engine itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly the same size.</v>

895
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they've done is just engineer it</v>

896
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:03.530
<v Speaker 2>to the Max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

897
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Well they have the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have what are inferior,</v>

898
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced cylinder heads ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>put onto an air cooled 9:11.</v>

899
00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It looks incredible and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick that in a car.</v>

900
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 2>That was originally what?</v>

901
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Ninety three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

902
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

903
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>91 to 94.</v>

904
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny though that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unbelievably appealing about </v>

905
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:30.000
<v Speaker 2>those air cooled cars that is willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these rich people pay a million </v>

906
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:35.760
<v Speaker 2>dollars or at least the current singers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A half million dollars from this car </v>

907
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.400
<v Speaker 2>just because you feel it more when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive it.</v>

908
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:41.401
<v Speaker 2>It's just got a feel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain kind of mechanical </v>

909
00:40:41.401 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 2>brilliance to it that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

910
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in comparable.</v>

911
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very unique.</v>

912
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

913
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:51.690
<v Speaker 2>there's something about those old cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly the ones that don't have </v>

914
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.400
<v Speaker 2>power steering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a thrill out of them.</v>

915
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird thrill even when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not even driving fast,</v>

916
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 2>especially with a porsche when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have no power steering combined</v>

917
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 2>with front engine car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sucks when no power steering,</v>

918
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Speaker 2>when the engine's in the back is okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the front of the car is pretty.</v>

919
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Is Pretty light so you don't need too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much muscle,</v>

920
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Speaker 2>but the nine slash 11 steering is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

921
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 2>super direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

922
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 2>It's super direct and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

923
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

924
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like a different thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

925
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy that had a a folks wagon </v>
<v Speaker 2>bug growing up,</v>

926
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a lot of power in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those Volkswagen bugs,</v>

927
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.820
<v Speaker 2>those fucking things like when you drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>them around,</v>

928
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>they give you a little smile on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>face because you're driving like</v>

929
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 1>this little tiny thing that feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely connected with the road.</v>

930
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Very capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you're smiling when you </v>

931
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.681
<v Speaker 1>drive one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate Volkswagen is they're </v>

932
00:41:47.681 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 1>taking in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take the buses,</v>

933
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:54.011
<v Speaker 1>the micro buses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they and they chop them down so </v>

934
00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 1>they're compressed and they put full </v>
<v Speaker 1>porsche floor pan drive,</v>

935
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so remember that nine,</v>

936
00:41:58.401 --> 00:41:59.180
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six turbo.</v>

937
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 1>You had the all wheel drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll put that whole floor pan on a</v>

938
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 1>microbus and they'll go to like track </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and beat up on race cars.</v>

939
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're look seriously.</v>

940
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

941
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 1>here's one that is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred and 30 horsepower portion </v>

942
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

943
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 1>three by turbo powered Volkswagen </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbus.</v>

944
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look in the rear window.</v>

945
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>See the intake on the rear window there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

946
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's on a racetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

947
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And it probably weighs nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

948
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

949
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>look what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God forbid you crash one of those.</v>

950
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's crazy people taking a vw bugs </v>

951
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>and put Porsche engines in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they've been doing that.</v>

952
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the common one is a suit.</v>

953
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old 3:56</v>

954
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 1>engines award.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

955
00:42:46.291 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

956
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I think someone was putting an older </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 engine in it,</v>

957
00:42:49.341 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 1>or a nine slash nine slash 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 12 engine.</v>

958
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Nine twelves are people are paying way </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much money for them.</v>

959
00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

960
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>They're like like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$40,000.</v>

961
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so slow.</v>

962
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a slow ass.</v>

963
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

964
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have like I get that.</v>

965
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It's about feel and yet nine slash nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 12 slash five field,</v>

966
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:17.291
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point there has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pace associated him know when they </v>

967
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:20.990
<v Speaker 1>made those cars it was the same shell on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside.</v>

968
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it nine slash 11?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

969
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:26.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just like d contented it cheap and </v>

970
00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:26.951
<v Speaker 1>everything and then put it interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That old engine,</v>

971
00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:31.020
<v Speaker 1>if somebody wanted a hot rod or nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 12 out and like put a crazy nine,</v>

972
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 1>nine three engine in it and to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspension,</v>

973
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it would still be a nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

974
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that convert nine twelves</v>

975
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 1>into nine slash 11 all the time.</v>

976
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people know.</v>

977
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Care.</v>

978
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's so crazy about it is </v>

979
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.131
<v Speaker 1>that you're essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same good stuff is the nine </v>

980
00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:52.310
<v Speaker 1>slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like on the outside,</v>

981
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but do the numbers match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

982
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but the difference with Porsche people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the difference between $40,000</v>

983
00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:05.231
<v Speaker 1>and $400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the most minute insignificant </v>

984
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.750
<v Speaker 1>bullshit of this one was delivered with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

985
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.800
<v Speaker 1>leather covered vents and a leather </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered fusebox and a fucking Fuchsia </v>

986
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel and it had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight glass.</v>

987
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So that one's 400 grand in that one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

988
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only muscle cars.</v>

989
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was one of four delivered and plum </v>

990
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.301
<v Speaker 1>crazy and automatic transmission on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday with a white roof and a cum </v>

991
00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 1>stain in the back feet</v>

992
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.670
<v Speaker 2>from the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love those auctions where you see </v>

993
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 2>pitch to greed and people's eyes just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>in off.</v>

994
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.920
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is when they people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

995
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>they'll get in a bidding war and overpay</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something by 40 grand and still feel</v>

996
00:44:44.521 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 2>like they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel like they score.</v>

997
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll give her lungs that motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get it.</v>

998
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I went to Barrett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson for the first time ever this </v>

999
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.410
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1003
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.460
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1004
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.620

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1005
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.830
<v Speaker 2>but a Barrett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson itself,</v>

1006
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 2>what they don't show you on TV is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy anything.</v>

1007
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy fat.</v>

1008
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:12.930
<v Speaker 2>They had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.160
<v Speaker 2>a jet turbine powered fan boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1010
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.200
<v Speaker 2>That you could buy like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the auction and I'm going </v>

1011
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.670
<v Speaker 2>under and then like a mile of swap Midi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1012
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:31.070
<v Speaker 2>And you could buy custom made cowboy </v>
<v Speaker 2>boots and tempurpedic beds and you know,</v>

1013
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 2>home furnishings and terrible art and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watches.</v>

1014
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>And it was a massage chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you can think of.</v>

1015
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1016
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.660
<v Speaker 2>it was just such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sea of commerce dam and uh,</v>

1017
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.570
<v Speaker 2>there's like a lot of cars that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make tv that are either amazing or very,</v>

1018
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 2>very sad and in their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to do to get in there?</v>

1019
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to there like a quotation </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to just walk in?</v>

1020
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to set a car in there.</v>

1021
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1022
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 2>you on their website and apply to sell a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

1023
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any.</v>

1024
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I think are happy to take your money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and sell your car.</v>

1025
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:12.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any restriction </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like Eric Andre from going there I </v>

1026
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 2>would like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just pinto.</v>

1027
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1028
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:21.291
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anything other than </v>

1029
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:21.291
<v Speaker 2>someone figuring out the joke before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

1030
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could probably do it,</v>

1031
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it's people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are pretty serious about cars.</v>

1032
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot more dealers that seemed</v>

1033
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:35.391
<v Speaker 2>like they were selling to each other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the actual buying and the </v>

1034
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:35.391
<v Speaker 2>selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1035
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of nascar jackets </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

1036
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 2>lot of nascar jackets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you see the,</v>

1037
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 2>they have some of the higher end options</v>
<v Speaker 2>to which sort of resemble the pebble </v>

1038
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.470
<v Speaker 2>beach ones.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd go back in a time machine,</v>

1053
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.820
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to my actual 10 year high school </v>

1054
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.161
<v Speaker 2>reunion in a orange Lamborghini as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goof and there was literally not a </v>

1055
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 2>single soul outside when I parked it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>upfront,</v>

1056
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 2>zero people's arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't have been more that shit.</v>

1057
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what you want a car like </v>

1058
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1059
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like 80 percent of rival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent right?</v>

1061
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent up and getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they see the Lamborghini,</v>

1062
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:53.491
<v Speaker 2>there's my mustang and you see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamborghini on the way out of the </v>

1063
00:47:53.491 --> 00:47:53.491
<v Speaker 2>reunion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really lame.</v>

1064
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It just was not the best looking year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1065
00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the notch back and the notch </v>

1066
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.470
<v Speaker 2>stack is better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine was a police car.</v>

1067
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1068
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 2>it was a highway patrol car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1069
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 2>See that's the notch back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1070
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:11.130
<v Speaker 2>it was cheaper to get those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember you can get the five point.</v>

1071
00:48:11.131 --> 00:48:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>

1072
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And the point of that is the police cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the lightest ones.</v>

1073
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 2>So no air conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sunroof,</v>

1074
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 2>no fog lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no power windows.</v>

1075
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Power door locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the Lightest v eight powered</v>

1076
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Mustang ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at my interior.</v>

1080
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like a seventies.</v>

1081
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Outdoor patio furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep that image back up there.</v>

1082

1083
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:47.840

<v Speaker 2>but just leave that there.</v>

1084
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Like the gauges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1085
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:52.030

<v Speaker 2>Porsche style steering wheel.</v>

1086

<v Speaker 2>recaro seats is from a 73 Mercedes to </v>

1089
00:49:01.531 --> 00:49:03.220
<v Speaker 2>80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1090
00:49:03.221 --> 00:49:08.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pattern came from a modern fabrics </v>

1091
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's like an outdoor patio furniture</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric.</v>

1092
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's uv resistant and spill </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant.</v>

1093
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.870
<v Speaker 2>What do those wheels Jamie Click on </v>
<v Speaker 2>those wheels and the righthand side.</v>

1094
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the wheels.</v>

1095
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>The wheels?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

1096
00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 2>it's called the hre rs one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1097
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Which is a three piece forged wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1098
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 2>and I'm running to 95 tires at all four </v>
<v Speaker 2>corners.</v>

1099
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So there are 18 by 10 and a half at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four corners.</v>

1100
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must handle amazing.</v>

1101
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sticks.</v>

1102
00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:39.911
<v Speaker 2>So it sticks like a gt three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns in so hard and I'm running the </v>

1103
00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:42.190
<v Speaker 2>tires or sport cup tubes which are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gt three tires.</v>

1104
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.890
<v Speaker 2>And what is this car way you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty one.</v>

1105
00:49:44.891 --> 00:49:45.500
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1106
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 2>so it's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got really good breaks,</v>

1107
00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 2>really good handling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's medium fast.</v>

1108
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It's about 350 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets quick enough.</v>

1109
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 2>You're going to leave the engine the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is?</v>

1110
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a crate motor in it,</v>

1111
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.040
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it could use some more,</v>

1112
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:08.570
<v Speaker 2>could use a little more and so if I keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car long term,</v>

1113
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take out that engine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in the Gt 3:50</v>

1114
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 2>if I keep the car long term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many horsepower is the GT?</v>

1115
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>

1116
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it revs to 8,200.</v>

1117
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:23.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's really about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1118
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I heard one of those in a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great insight.</v>

1119
00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't sound anything like a Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

1120
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.850
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a something,</v>

1121
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more Italian.</v>

1122
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

1123
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to sound like a Ferrari or.</v>

1124
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Well they do a different firing order </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also,</v>

1125
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to hurry me if that's </v>

1126
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:43.931
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the flat plain crank changes the </v>

1127
00:50:43.931 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 1>sound gt 3:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaust,</v>

1128
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 1>2018 gt 3:50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty glorious.</v>

1129
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm terrified that they're going to</v>

1130
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 1>come out with that gt 500 and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall in love.</v>

1131
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could happen.</v>

1132
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It has a very uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1133
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds amazing.</v>

1134
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have one of my videos open </v>

1135
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 1>in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1136

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds so good.</v>

1139
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.680

<v Speaker 1>it's a very unlike anything else on the </v>

1140
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:23.680

1142
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most special engines.</v>

1143
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 700 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all heavy.</v>

1144
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Why can anybody figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had a 3000 pound Mustang that </v>

1154
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.150
<v Speaker 1>had the features that people demand from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern car,</v>

1155
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be $200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd,</v>

1156
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a Ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1157
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even for ours aren't that light </v>

1158
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1159
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1160
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1161
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 1>what is the lightest thing you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy?</v>

1162
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a Porsche boxster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lotus.</v>

1163
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Lotus for 10 is under 3000 pounds I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1164
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1165
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice car.</v>

1166
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I drove that little one to little </v>
<v Speaker 1>league.</v>

1167
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trove that a few years back.</v>

1168
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've already beat you up like that.</v>

1169
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Does it didn't have any horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

1170
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It was the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1171
00:52:39.891 --> 00:52:44.891
<v Speaker 1>not the core of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exceeds the really the one where it </v>

1172
00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any floor panels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have anything.</v>

1173
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of interesting because it's</v>

1174
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like a little go cart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't load us this thing.</v>

1175
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I drove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the evora sport for 10.</v>

1177
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I just drove that and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1178
00:52:57.561 --> 00:52:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice.</v>

1179
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's also a manual transmission?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1180
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a super charged camry engine,</v>

1181
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1182
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many horsepower?</v>

1183
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred and 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supercharged carries.</v>

1184
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good looking and it stopped </v>

1185
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:14.570
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a titanium exhaust.</v>

1186
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so unique.</v>

1187
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sea of nine slash 11,</v>

1188
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 1>it does stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you would like that car.</v>

1189
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that that would be a good one </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

1190
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Like you need another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a</v>

1191
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.270
<v Speaker 3>pretty cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the other one.</v>

1192
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elise is the one that I drove that </v>

1194
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 3>gray one that you just clicked on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1195
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 3>I drove that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful looking car,</v>

1196
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's got no balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1197
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.400
<v Speaker 3>but you can stun those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is crazy how slow the is.</v>

1198
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 3>They made some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have driven the smaller engine</v>

1199
00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 3>when they made some that were a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

1200
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The base one was like 180 horsepower and</v>

1201
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 3>then they go up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 60 or to 80.</v>

1202
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.070
<v Speaker 3>But there's something thrilling about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1203
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Like driving a flea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 3>So how much does that thing way think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 500 or something.</v>

1205
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1206
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing and it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just make beautiful cars.</v>

1207
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Those lotuses are that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will be $30,000</v>

1208
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 3>used cars until the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Elise?</v>

1209
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1210
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Bottomed out at 30 grand and you can buy</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and sell them at 30 grand all day.</v>

1211
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny how cars were worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost nothing and then like a 73 Rs </v>

1212
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.310
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

1213
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.220
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't an rs America just at Rs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three RS is worth like a million dollars</v>

1214
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be worth $20,000</v>

1215
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:31.800
<v Speaker 3>just a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did that happen?</v>

1216
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I remember I saw those for sale and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone saying this is the perfect </v>

1217
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the most powerful.</v>

1218
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 3>It's only like 225 horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1219
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:42.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's so light and so fun to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1220
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.480
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here with 225 </v>
<v Speaker 3>horsepower.</v>

1221
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you know,</v>

1222
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world has become more automated,</v>

1223
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is faster,</v>

1224
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.360
<v Speaker 3>more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but less involved and less mechanical.</v>

1225
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with Porsche,</v>

1226
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 3>a younger audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very wealthy audience,</v>

1227
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:08.170
<v Speaker 3>you know that as has really decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the older collector cars is a </v>

1228
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 3>currency that you can drive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>investments and just a lot of rich </v>

1229
00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:13.800
<v Speaker 3>people out there right now.</v>

1230
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.480
<v Speaker 3>And they're not making any more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 73,</v>

1231
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.000
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a real problem with,</v>

1233
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 3>singer is they're taking those cars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chopping them the fuck up.</v>

1234
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I'd taken a nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

1235
00:55:24.091 --> 00:55:28.520
<v Speaker 3>four and just chopping the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1236
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Taking 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar car and turning it into a </v>

1237
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.231
<v Speaker 3>$500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you can get on the list and get </v>

1238
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:40.371
<v Speaker 3>one and you take it home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's immediately worth $700 on the open </v>

1239
00:55:40.371 --> 00:55:40.620
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

1240
00:55:40.621 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people don't want to wait.</v>

1241
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Flipper market for a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like name your price.</v>

1242
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Name your price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to get a singer,</v>

1243
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:49.620
<v Speaker 3>made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many years is even his waiting list?</v>

1244
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three years.</v>

1245
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:53.430
<v Speaker 3>So two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three years for waiting list than a year</v>

1246
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:58.431
<v Speaker 3>to make the car and they're making it by</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand with carbon fiber.</v>

1247
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:04.430
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the videos of people visiting </v>

1248
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.640
<v Speaker 3>the factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting together here.</v>

1249
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 3>You should go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should go,</v>

1250
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:09.260
<v Speaker 3>but I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll introduce you to it.</v>

1251
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start doing numbers in my head.</v>

1252
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 3>It's just all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean and there's.</v>

1253
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:16.350
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a whole cut singer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1254
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Not to dwell on singer so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they opened the door for a,</v>

1255
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 3>a sub industry them that's</v>

1256
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 1>doing $200,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 1>builds that are like halfway to singer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

1258
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1259
00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fucking excessive.</v>

1260
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm doing this safari thing,</v>

1261
00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:43.531
<v Speaker 1>but I bought my 87 Carrera and its stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I almost didn't want to start </v>

1262
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:46.720
<v Speaker 1>modifying it because it was just such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice thing to drive around.</v>

1263
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It was just lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's recent enough where they </v>

1264
00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.360
<v Speaker 1>have like good breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's a super light car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighties is good.</v>

1266

1315
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.560
<v Speaker 1>How did they figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much better than the americans did </v>

1316
00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:58.750
<v Speaker 1>when it came to reliability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1317
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 1>they just built a light car and then put</v>
<v Speaker 1>their accord engine in it.</v>

1318
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1319
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but I mean all oF their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1320
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:09.620
<v Speaker 1>did you go through across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking earlier about land </v>

1321
00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:09.620
<v Speaker 1>cruisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like god would be one of the most</v>

1322
00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 1>reliable cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of the free world.</v>

1323
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Like why the fuck are they so good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1324
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 1>And most companies like american </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies during that same age,</v>

1325
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.520
<v Speaker 1>like you get a 19 nineties ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1326
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

1327
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:22.060
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible</v>

1328
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:22.720
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1329
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1330
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 2>But 1995 land cruiser driving through </v>
<v Speaker 2>africa right now.</v>

1331
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Land cruiSers are specific or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting example specifically because</v>

1332
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I went on the press launch for land </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruiser,</v>

1333
00:59:32.591 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 2>so I know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most cars are built to a 10 year service</v>

1334
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:42.161
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The land cruiser is built to a 25 year </v>

1335
00:59:42.161 --> 00:59:45.971
<v Speaker 2>service life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The land cruisers parts are almost 100 </v>

1336
00:59:45.971 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>percent unique to land cruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1337
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:51.610
<v Speaker 2>they share very few parts with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else in toyota's lineup and that's why </v>

1338
00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go,</v>

1339
00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT's a full size suv.</v>

1340
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:57.761
<v Speaker 2>Why is this thing $90,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everything on it is industrial </v>

1341
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 2>grade shit designed to last twice as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as like any other car.</v>

1342
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like when you drive a one,</v>

1343
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:08.471
<v Speaker 2>two tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute absolute texts and there are </v>

1344
01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 2>over engineered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think in the,</v>

1345
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:14.110
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the japanese design and </v>

1346
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 2>production philosophy was just so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond where we were.</v>

1347
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were making shit during those years.</v>

1348
01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have an 88 mustang you just </v>

1349
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.601
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an 87 porsche and I had a 1998 </v>

1350
01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:31.670
<v Speaker 2>nissan skyline gtr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marsha and the fucking skyline.</v>

1351
01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Our same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save time period.</v>

1352
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.860
<v Speaker 2>They're spaceships compared to the hunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit that is my mustang.</v>

1353
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean those guidelines are bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1354
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Skyline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1355
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sold it,</v>

1356
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:49.420
<v Speaker 2>but I doubled up in six months though </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1357
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Think about what they did with the gtr </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they came in.</v>

1358
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.920
<v Speaker 2>When nissan came out with the gtr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new,</v>

1359
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>the new interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Onewest one.</v>

1360
01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only driven one of those twice,</v>

1361
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>but one time when I drove one though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most remarkable thing about it was I</v>

1362
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:06.620
<v Speaker 2>was taking a turn to to hit an off ramp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like a little late.</v>

1363
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1364
01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>that's the law.</v>

1365
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to change lanes and it just went </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

1366
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:11.590
<v Speaker 2>cross the lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zip you up,</v>

1367
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No lien.</v>

1368
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.660
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing just defied physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1369
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 2>this thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1370
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:24.430
<v Speaker 2>it's calculating how much mass is </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning this way and adjusting to </v>

1371
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>flatten everything out electronically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually the new acura nsx,</v>

1372
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>that's like the supercar you one second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 grand does that same thing that the </v>

1373
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 2>gtr did and oh nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does it much more seamlessly.</v>

1374
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.140
<v Speaker 2>So You think you did it really that </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome driving that just happened in </v>

1375
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 2>the gtr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1376
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:50.711
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gtr is doing all this awesome shit </v>

1377
01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:50.711
<v Speaker 2>in the nsx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1378
01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking hero because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so.</v>

1379
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.300
<v Speaker 2>It's so seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the gtr,</v>

1380
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>all wheel drive system with these clutch</v>
<v Speaker 2>packs and whatever.</v>

1382
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.210
<v Speaker 2>So you can hear it like clunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clunk,</v>

1383
01:02:02.211 --> 01:02:04.670
<v Speaker 2>clunking around and like moving power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing all this shit,</v>

1384
01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:09.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nsx is rear wheel drive gas engine </v>

1385
01:02:09.671 --> 01:02:11.720
<v Speaker 2>and then electric motors in the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>

1386
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>So it can do all kinds of funkY shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the front wheels.</v>

1387
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 2>The two wheels can be going completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different speeds from each other.</v>

1388
01:02:18.381 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It's comPletely independent of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at the back.</v>

1389
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>It's all this computer algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's magic front end,</v>

1390
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:31.190
<v Speaker 2>front end that cannot happen within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints of like normal rotational </v>

1391
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa dude,</v>

1392
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 2>you should work for an acura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should sell cars.</v>

1393
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>You got my dick hard for an nsx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good buy right now.</v>

1394
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:47.690
<v Speaker 2>People don't want them to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because they're not like </v>

1395
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.690
<v Speaker 2>the old one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

1396
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you want tHe old one and people wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stick and simple and it's complicated</v>

1397
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:55.611
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if people were looking for a double </v>

1398
01:02:55.611 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 2>clutch supercar that seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good bargain.</v>

1399
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:57.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a great looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1400
01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I had one weekend was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1401
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of seems very accessible,</v>

1402
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1403
01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1404
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very forgiving and very easy to </v>

1405
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 2>drive and it makes you feel like mario </v>
<v Speaker 2>andretti,</v>

1406
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>hope they don't not make them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got to make them for a bit.</v>

1407
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.700
<v Speaker 2>They've committed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think uh,</v>

1408
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you should buy one if you think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might like on a tinge of responsibility </v>

1409
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.360
<v Speaker 2>when the viper went out of business and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I never bought a viper because there's </v>

1410
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 2>so imposturous it's such a preposterous.</v>

1411
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought about getting one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those acrs with the wings vented hoods </v>

1412
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:37.890
<v Speaker 2>and looked down like just for just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a douchebag car.</v>

1413
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to list off like the </v>

1414
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 2>check boxes of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally enjoy,</v>

1415
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:46.430
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it does actually tick most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those boxes in there.</v>

1416
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Totally looking like a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Besides that,</v>

1417
01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 2>it really takes the rest of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like godzilla is dick.</v>

1418
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>It looks like this sort of like super </v>
<v Speaker 2>autumn of it's very shredder,</v>

1419
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's so american too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a ridiculous thing to build.</v>

1420
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Well it's american.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's so american about it is that </v>

1421
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.080
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1422
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.180
<v Speaker 2>porsche developing this insane gearbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1423
01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:14.181
<v Speaker 2>that can shift in a microsecond and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nissan doing this crazy fucking all </v>

1424
01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:19.191
<v Speaker 2>wheel drive system and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever accurate doing their torque </v>

1425
01:04:19.191 --> 01:04:19.191
<v Speaker 2>vectoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electric motors,</v>

1426
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.660
<v Speaker 2>fibers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like more downforce,</v>

1427
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know manual gearbox,</v>

1428
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:24.330
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

1429
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just more downforce.</v>

1430
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Develop the stickiest tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find here.</v>

1431
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 2>You can pop these things out and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more downforce.</v>

1432
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the whole thing.</v>

1433
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swings just put wings on it and that'll </v>

1434
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.701
<v Speaker 2>be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile they brought it to every </v>

1435
01:04:40.701 --> 01:04:41.120
<v Speaker 2>race track and they were tracked here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breaking records.</v>

1436
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1437
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:47.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most american thing ever just </v>

1438
01:04:47.391 --> 01:04:47.391
<v Speaker 2>bought a bigger gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1439
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>The biggest 50 caliber machine gun ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desert eagle.</v>

1440
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 2>It's America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big ole american dick.</v>

1441
01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It's super America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:04:57.031 --> 01:05:02.031
<v Speaker 2>But then they stopped making them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad because merca isn't necessarily </v>

1443
01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:05.871
<v Speaker 2>commercially viable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes a come on the age of trump </v>

1444
01:05:05.871 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 2>that they can bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>

1445
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Vipers for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every coal miner gets a viper,</v>

1446
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>a job in a viper for every coal miner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1447
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the most preposterous car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you agree?</v>

1448
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1449
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>we have Some preposterous vehicles here </v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

1450
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can get a,</v>

1451
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>a pickup truck version of an escalate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty funny,</v>

1452
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that still.</v>

1453
01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I think they may have stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I may have stepped on my own </v>

1454
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1455
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preposterous.</v>

1456
01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty awesome.</v>

1457
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ford gt is pretty preposterous in a </v>

1458
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:44.370
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very good way.</v>

1459
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 2>that's a superchArge supercar though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extremely super.</v>

1460
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>

1461
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Is john [inaudible] in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling his?</v>

1462
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the contract is </v>

1463
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>enforceable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>

1464
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going by what I've read on.</v>

1465
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Tell people what the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to get one of the new ford gts,</v>

1466
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:06.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's called a homologation race </v>

1467
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:06.210
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1468
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:10.800
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted to go when the 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>of lamar in a certain class that the lmg</v>

1469
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:15.760
<v Speaker 2>t class in order to race in that class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be a street car.</v>

1470
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to build a certain number of</v>

1471
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:23.101
<v Speaker 2>streetcars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just build a dedicated race </v>

1472
01:06:23.101 --> 01:06:23.101
<v Speaker 2>car that would be called the prototype </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

1473
01:06:23.101 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to build,</v>

1474
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I think the number is 499.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 400 and something for 54,</v>

1475
01:06:28.091 --> 01:06:33.091
<v Speaker 2>99,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is for decides that the </v>

1476
01:06:33.091 --> 01:06:34.750
<v Speaker 2>demand will outstrip the supply and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there rather than,</v>

1477
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest bittering or whatever they make </v>

1478
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you like apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1479
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:44.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a social media star or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity or someone you had to like </v>

1480
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.360
<v Speaker 2>tell them why you should have a ford gt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you were going to do with it </v>

1481
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and how you were going to share your </v>
<v Speaker 2>four gt with the world.</v>

1482
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:58.741
<v Speaker 2>And then they would decide that you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>earned the right to buy their $450,000</v>

1483
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:04.951
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came with a contract that you </v>

1484
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:04.951
<v Speaker 2>couldn't sell it for two years.</v>

1485
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:06.290
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want people flipping them </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1486
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:11.610
<v Speaker 2>which apparently is exactly what sean's </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen when it did seem to be so fucking </v>

1487
01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would,</v>

1488
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>why would he violate the contract for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred?</v>

1489
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really huge,</v>

1490
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>very huge person or miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HoW huge is he?</v>

1491
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just enormous.</v>

1492
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Like with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet he's probably only like six,</v>

1493
01:07:31.101 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 2>three or six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four,</v>

1494
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

1495
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>He can't fit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he can't fit in it,</v>

1496
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that's probably why he would get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it rather than tall mr.</v>

1497
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Scene is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when my head hit the ceiling,</v>

1498
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>that's probably exactly what he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably six to at least.</v>

1499
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:51.930
<v Speaker 2>He seems like a guy who should be even </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer and taller than he is because </v>

1500
01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>he's so thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like they chopped off a foot</v>

1501
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 2>of his arms and every place bought a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>

1502
01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but his risks are like fucking tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>trunks.</v>

1503
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six foot 2:50.</v>

1504
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See he probably be close.</v>

1505
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 2>It'd be close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six foot two or six foot.</v>

1506
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Six foot 250 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1507
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 2>he's short of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1508
01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did.</v>

1509
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's two inches for you,</v>

1510
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:15.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe felt squashed in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1511
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I drove it for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it,</v>

1512
01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>what kind of sacrifices to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he fuck like me.</v>

1513
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Might be a good car for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

1514
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So the seed is fixed and the pedals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>steering wheel are adjustable.</v>

1515
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>You can adjust the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How bizarre.</v>

1516
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pedals come to you.</v>

1517
01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you gotta do,</v>

1518
01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:37.871
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what you have to do because the </v>

1519
01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shape of the car dictates the </v>

1520
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:40.730
<v Speaker 2>seatback angles a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just make this seat slide?</v>

1521
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Put the seat on a seat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1522
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The car is so low.</v>

1523
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 2>You do see a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rail is like inches.</v>

1524
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Precious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precious inches.</v>

1525
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.940
<v Speaker 2>The roof is 43 inches from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like this.</v>

1526
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so low.</v>

1527
01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It's that low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 43 inches from the roof to roof </v>

1528
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:00.520
<v Speaker 2>cleaning ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Compared to all the car at one law by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way in the year was supposed to.</v>

1530
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You park it next to a nine slash 11 and </v>

1531
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.190
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 is like six inches taller </v>
<v Speaker 2>than one of these things.</v>

1532
01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes a really big difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 24 hours of le ma,</v>

1533
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you're talking 200 mile an hour straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1534
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a huge difference.</v>

1535
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.320
<v Speaker 2>So they've designed the car without seat</v>
<v Speaker 2>rails to get everything even further </v>

1536
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1537
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a dope looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one that was black with red </v>

1538
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>stripe.</v>

1539
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 2>That was the press car was driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1540
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 2>has got the same color to god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty car.</v>

1541
01:09:32.571 --> 01:09:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it's gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Pretty car.</v>

1542
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Carbon fiber wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are lovely.</v>

1543
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon fiber wheels.</v>

1544
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:45.251
<v Speaker 2>So there's two kinds of weight in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's sprung weight and unsprung </v>

1545
01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:45.380
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

1546
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.800
<v Speaker 2>So sprung weight is weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is most of what you think of as the</v>

1547
01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:52.700
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the engine,</v>

1548
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:57.790
<v Speaker 2>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>AnYthing that has sprung on the </v>

1549
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 2>suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsprung weight,</v>

1550
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.590
<v Speaker 2>his weight on the car that is not sprung</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the suspension.</v>

1551
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 2>So wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brake,</v>

1552
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 2>rotors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tires,</v>

1553
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:08.390
<v Speaker 2>suspension components that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sItting on the suspension.</v>

1554
01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a rough calculation,</v>

1555
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:16.810
<v Speaker 2>but like roughly one pound of unsprung </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight will translate the feeling of </v>

1556
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:24.550
<v Speaker 2>five pounds of tongue weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So meaning like if you are able to pull </v>

1557
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds of unsprung weight out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

1558
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:31.610
<v Speaker 2>each wheel is four pounds or five pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>lighter than a stock.</v>

1559
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1560
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.330
<v Speaker 2>So you're not about 20 pounds unsprung </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight to your car.</v>

1561
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:39.530
<v Speaker 2>YOur car will feel like you pulled 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds out of it and it will stop,</v>

1562
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerate,</v>

1563
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:44.470
<v Speaker 2>turn better commute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1564
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>a totally in all our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll perform better in all areas.</v>

1565
01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:52.871
<v Speaker 2>So to go from a forged aluminum wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 23 or 24 or 25 pounds a wheel </v>

1566
01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.320
<v Speaker 2>to a carbon fiber wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like 11 pounds a wheel,</v>

1567
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:05.910
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling so much unsprung weight </v>

1568
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.910
<v Speaker 2>out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll feel like,</v>

1569
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:07.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging a baseball bat with a weight on</v>

1570
01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:09.650
<v Speaker 2>it and then just throw in that weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1571
01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>

1573
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>

1574
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 2>massive difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the wheels are so expense,</v>

1575
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine like how many companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>make carbon fiber wheel one wine called </v>

1576
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:26.340
<v Speaker 2>carbon revolution and they're from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia and those are the only make </v>

1577
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:26.340
<v Speaker 2>them for the four days.</v>

1578
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.010
<v Speaker 2>You can buy the wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have fitments for a few different </v>

1579
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:34.041
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porsche gt three is one and they make </v>

1580
01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>them for ford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you do me a favor jamie and pull up</v>

1581
01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the photo of that black ford gt with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>red stripes?</v>

1582
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>It's on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have my instagram handy,</v>

1583
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>the one I drove up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly.</v>

1584
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 2>The road presence is just seen and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes noises that only god damn it makes</v>

1585
01:11:55.921 --> 01:12:00.921
<v Speaker 2>noises that only race cars make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a specific sound like you know </v>

1586
01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:04.140
<v Speaker 2>the pops and crackles you get from most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these modern cars and they dumped the</v>

1587
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 2>fuel in the exhaust and shit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1588
01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:09.880
<v Speaker 2>But it's a synthetic eee sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's programmed right?</v>

1589
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 2>This does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not programmed.</v>

1590
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just like fuel into header.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1591
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:18.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1592
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Scars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this goes for like $500,000</v>

1593
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:27.830
<v Speaker 2>for 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get one but you can't get </v>

1594
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 2>what you can't get unless you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>johnson and then the route.</v>

1595
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean the rumor is he got like over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million for his butt.</v>

1596
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so somebody ordered off.</v>

1597
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flipped it and flipped it.</v>

1598
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 2>And so they're suing him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that it was thrown out.</v>

1600
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 2>They sued them for breach of contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for selling it,</v>

1601
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:47.420
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he claims or claimed that the contract </v>

1602
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.720
<v Speaker 2>didn't say he couldn't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1603
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 2>So it was a verbal agreement or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

1604
01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:55.971
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was one of those things they </v>

1605
01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:56.370
<v Speaker 2>just hoped nobody would call him out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's unenforceable.</v>

1606
01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:56.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1607
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:01.910
<v Speaker 2>how do they sell you something and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforced that you can't sell the thing </v>

1608
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

1609
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 2>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally can't do that.</v>

1610
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:08.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's enforceable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think once the contract is signed in </v>

1611
01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.170
<v Speaker 2>and you take possession of this object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's yours to do whatever you want,</v>

1612
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it's morally.</v>

1613
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I compare american moTherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for fucking hats off.</v>

1614
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.260
<v Speaker 2>You made a dope ass car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing's amazing.</v>

1615
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It's extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely crazy.</v>

1616
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.920
<v Speaker 2>it really in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1617
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.630
<v Speaker 2>it's unlike anythinG else on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>because even even the,</v>

1618
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very,</v>

1619
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:30.840
<v Speaker 2>very high end super cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1620
01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:35.841
<v Speaker 2>your lamborghini aventador is that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>400 grand and you're v12 ferrari's and </v>

1621
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:39.180
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff are fundamentally they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>road cars and even when you,</v>

1622
01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:44.181
<v Speaker 2>they go racing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of take the road car and </v>

1623
01:13:44.181 --> 01:13:47.500
<v Speaker 2>modify it for racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so clearly a race car that they </v>

1624
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.000
<v Speaker 2>had to build some street cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1625
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fucking rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks amazing.</v>

1626
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.110
<v Speaker 2>It's got an air brake on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The active.</v>

1627
01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>So the go back to the rear picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.580
<v Speaker 2>So the wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole wing that,</v>

1629
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:07.610
<v Speaker 2>that whole wing that goes across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back there lifts up when you hit the </v>

1630
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.610
<v Speaker 2>brakes.</v>

1631
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Well it lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you start driving quick,</v>

1632
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:14.391
<v Speaker 2>it lifts up and becomes a wing wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you hit the brakes it </v>

1633
01:14:14.391 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 2>flips up and becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual airbrake.</v>

1634
01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And it is extremely effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

1635
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it know when you break </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>

1636
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>nose dives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it completely eliminates the dive.</v>

1637
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So the car just squats straight down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1638
01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 2>That's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking gorgeous.</v>

1639
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to keep making them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1640
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1641
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Ford?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fired to guest.</v>

1642
01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 2>They lose money on every single one they</v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

1643
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:41.060
<v Speaker 2>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a bullshit word.</v>

1644
01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>We run in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know trump.</v>

1645
01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were going to fix all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that was part of your platform.</v>

1646
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make american great again.</v>

1647
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Do we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The car economy is.</v>

1648
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 2>It's such a global economy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>american,</v>

1649
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 2>like we make a bunch of the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cats are built.</v>

1650
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:06.691
<v Speaker 2>Like in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make bmw x five in south caroLina.</v>

1651
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make up ford tundras in Texas.</v>

1652
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what toyota tundra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toyota tundra.</v>

1653
01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Toyota is a make a couple different cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in America.</v>

1654
01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 2>A couple of cars in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think japanese automakers probably </v>

1655
01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.360
<v Speaker 2>have at least as many auto workers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America as american car companies do.</v>

1656
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.800
<v Speaker 2>This is definitely the same car I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving press cars.</v>

1657
01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:31.060
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is great is just the.</v>

1658
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:36.070
<v Speaker 2>The buttresses like when it goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see right through the side of </v>

1659
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:39.931
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just see the air there between </v>

1660
01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:39.931
<v Speaker 2>the tunnel and the pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so pretty.</v>

1661
01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:44.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the best looking car I've </v>

1662
01:15:44.431 --> 01:15:44.740
<v Speaker 2>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so cool.</v>

1663
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It was so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as like american cars,</v>

1664
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 2>that literally might be the best looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>car I've ever seen.</v>

1665
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I think if it's my money I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would buy the older gt,</v>

1666
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:58.660
<v Speaker 2>the 2005 one because I liked the manual </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmission.</v>

1667
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just think it was.</v>

1668
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 2>that was just one of the best cars ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1669
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever drive one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>

1670
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 2>What's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best?</v>

1671
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best,</v>

1672
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.270
<v Speaker 2>best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best?</v>

1673
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is a race car,</v>

1674
01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1675
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>and everything that comes with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one,</v>

1676
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 2>it was a road car and it was let's make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best road car we can make.</v>

1677
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And so it wasn't a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful race car,</v>

1678
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 2>but as a road car it was just glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ride and the power and the style and</v>

1679
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the sound and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1680
01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>they had to develop that car very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1681
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I think the last time I was on this show</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about for gts and you </v>

1682
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.660
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything's overbuilt.</v>

1683
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You can run like double stock horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and you can run almost 280 miles </v>

1684
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 2>an hour in the fucking mile and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things on stock arrow and when people do</v>

1685
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>crAzy shit with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like put twin turbos in them and stuff,</v>

1686
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I should not even that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive,</v>

1687
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's proven science at this point.</v>

1688
01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:50.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not breaking any new ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1689
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1690
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.980
<v Speaker 2>it's actually because they're super </v>
<v Speaker 2>supercharged from the factory.</v>

1691
01:16:53.981 --> 01:16:58.981
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're meant to handle forced </v>

1692
01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:00.601
<v Speaker 2>induction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the turbo system you take off the </v>

1693
01:17:00.601 --> 01:17:02.260
<v Speaker 2>supercharger in the turbo system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplants it.</v>

1694
01:17:02.261 --> 01:17:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Is that the right word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1695
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:06.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs more boost,</v>

1696
01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong engine.</v>

1697
01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And so they're</v>

1698
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>not completely different systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1699
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>they both force air in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just they do it in different ways.</v>

1700
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And when you buy one from the factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many horsepower did he come with?</v>

1701
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Five 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty is a lot back then.</v>

1702
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 1>With no traction control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the last last car.</v>

1704
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>The viper to the same year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viber might've had one year,</v>

1705
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:30.770
<v Speaker 1>but basically the last car without </v>
<v Speaker 1>traction.</v>

1706
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability control.</v>

1707
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people would,</v>

1708
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>would crash them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1709
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>My gt three doesn't have shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has.</v>

1711
01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has um,</v>

1712
01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 1>control and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

1713
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it has antilock brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has traction control </v>

1714
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>hit really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the next model did because it's </v>

1715
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>the rs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

1716
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how fortunate for you if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

1717
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a very raw car.</v>

1718
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I loved your car out of a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driving your car to fun cars,</v>

1719
01:17:58.551 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1720
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the next thing I buy my bnrs </v>

1721
01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're getting so expensive.</v>

1722
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but safe money thousand seven.</v>

1723
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Year two is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the year.</v>

1724
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>The one aFterwards they became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started having traction control.</v>

1725
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's true.</v>

1726
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand seven gt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three rs.</v>

1727
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:24.521
<v Speaker 1>No traction control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure there is a period of </v>

1728
01:18:24.521 --> 01:18:27.760
<v Speaker 1>2000 early two thousands up to an end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>two thousands where portia was using the</v>

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.720

1731
01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 1>very strong engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost say that would give me correctly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I thought it was interesting </v>

1742
01:19:11.321 --> 01:19:13.610
<v Speaker 1>because it was like a snapshot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a snapshot in time,</v>

1746

1749
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no tech companies.</v>

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.450
<v Speaker 1>There's very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chat.</v>

1751
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Traffic was nothing back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men talk to somebody about what traffic </v>

1752
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.670
<v Speaker 1>is like in 1960 and la when the guy just</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought that up earlier,</v>

1753
01:19:37.671 --> 01:19:38.150
<v Speaker 1>this show.</v>

1754
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved here in [inaudible] 94 and I </v>

1755
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.390
<v Speaker 1>remember when I moved here it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like this.</v>

1756
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.650
<v Speaker 1>really nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten 100 percent worse.</v>

1757
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like just twice as many people here</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it feels like us,</v>

1758
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>

1759
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you get on the highway on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturday night just heading into la on a</v>

1760
01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.580
<v Speaker 1>saturday night and you're stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumper to bumper traffic for no reason.</v>

1761
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.710
<v Speaker 1>No one's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no accident.</v>

1762
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>

1763
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading a book right now called </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>

1764
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's about the science of traffic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1765
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>They did a study in la</v>

1766
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>and saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2:00</v>

1767
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 3>PM traffic is worse than any weekday day</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush hour in los.</v>

1768
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's out doing their shit.</v>

1769
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you go to another city,</v>

1770
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.360
<v Speaker 3>like if you go to a big city like </v>
<v Speaker 3>seattle and you're like,</v>

1771
01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 3>you're there with them and they complain</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the traffic,</v>

1772
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 3>go shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

1773
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:32.510
<v Speaker 3>what I'm doing must be wrong then </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm dealing with way too many </v>

1774
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:33.420
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys have got it right.</v>

1775
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 3>This is the right amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a lot of people,</v>

1776
01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 3>but enough to many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a medium sized city that's not la.</v>

1777
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.340
<v Speaker 3>And in traffic makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes in,</v>

1779
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.290
<v Speaker 3>it goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the.</v>

1781
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Hence the scooter you want to get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>before it gets all blade runner.</v>

1782
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1784

1791
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for me not looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the cars had done will be on my </v>

1792
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.411
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>App was the app that wants to give us </v>

1793
01:21:18.411 --> 01:21:20.601
<v Speaker 3>access to early warning app says you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have 60 seconds for your fucking day </v>

1794
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:22.890

1796
01:21:23.401 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 3>there's an app now that's working in </v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

1797
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:28.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're about to die.</v>

1798
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an earthquake's about to hit.</v>

1799
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 3>They apparently have it depending upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>the magnitude,</v>

1800
01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really scary because the higher</v>

1801
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:39.780
<v Speaker 3>magnitude possibility the more time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1802
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:44.880
<v Speaker 3>So they really can give you up to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute to know your foxville dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of shit I need for.</v>

1807

1836
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:13.740
<v Speaker 3>refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Refrigeration is going to tie you up and</v>

1837
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.120

<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1842
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>who has a fLoat tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so awesome.</v>

1843
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1844
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My.</v>

1845
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>My real concern is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that the mass of humans,</v>

1846
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 3>just the sheer number is so insane and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think it's.</v>

1847
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's sustainable like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people that are.</v>

1848
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:47.640
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a time ever in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history where we've had masses of people</v>

1849
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 3>crammed into areas like we have today in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our urban areas.</v>

1850
01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:57.331
<v Speaker 3>You mean modern America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Modern Mexico city is like that jammed </v>

1851
01:23:57.331 --> 01:23:58.690
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's quite a few places that are like</v>

1852
01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.930
<v Speaker 3>the population numbers higher now than </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ever been recorded.</v>

1853
01:24:01.931 --> 01:24:06.931
<v Speaker 3>Human history and so the population in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these cities is higher than it's ever </v>

1854
01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:06.931
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never had,</v>

1855
01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:09.010
<v Speaker 3>like matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never had 20 million people in a city</v>

1856
01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:11.140
<v Speaker 3>before in America like we do in la.</v>

1857
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Was that jamie stay through the smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>population than los angeles county?</v>

1858
01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Is that all of them on the full 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>something states?</v>

1859
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of them is la county.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty dollars million people yet.</v>

1860
01:24:23.111 --> 01:24:24.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like 16 something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1861
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:29.700
<v Speaker 3>I think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like on the 10 to 11 million </v>

1862
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.810
<v Speaker 3>units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so looking at this map and it's one tiny</v>

1863
01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 3>little area of California and it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>more people in it.</v>

1864
01:24:35.531 --> 01:24:40.531
<v Speaker 3>If it was a state than almost every </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking state except Florida that in </v>

1865
01:24:40.531 --> 01:24:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>

1866
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania,</v>

1867
01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and given me Illinois,</v>

1868
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My focus rs was having fun,</v>

1908
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 1>we adjusted the suspension and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to shake it down.</v>

1909
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Those are fast little cars very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with mountain on mine.</v>

1911
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 1>455.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll torque from a four cylinder and we</v>

1912
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 1>have a adapt kw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ddc adaptive suspension,</v>

1913
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.680
<v Speaker 1>adaptive coil overs.</v>

1914
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cars very,</v>

1915
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:58.241
<v Speaker 1>very fast right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really like cartoon right </v>

1916
01:26:58.241 --> 01:26:58.241
<v Speaker 1>now that's not so light.</v>

1917
01:26:58.550 --> 01:27:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's small but it's all wheel drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>which adds to the weight and so it's a,</v>

1918
01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not super heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a,</v>

1919
01:27:06.141 --> 01:27:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not a featherweight porsche or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1920
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And a liTtle less maybe 33,</v>
<v Speaker 1>34,</v>

1921
01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:15.611

1923
01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.800
<v Speaker 1>wheel drive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually power oversteer.</v>

1924
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like when the front wheel </v>
<v Speaker 1>slip you get power to the back.</v>

1925
01:27:25.731 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Like it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call it drift mode,</v>

1926
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.790
<v Speaker 1>which can send up to 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to the back.</v>

1927
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 1>So you've been wanting you to get crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's the ccc.</v>

1949
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the ctcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ct six is their biggest one.</v>

1950
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brand new one has a crazy v engine.</v>

1951
01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1952
01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.680
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for sale yet.</v>

1953
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:40.010
<v Speaker 1>IT has a twin turbo like dual overhead </v>
<v Speaker 1>cam v eight,</v>

1954
01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:45.011
<v Speaker 1>which is like the most advanced general </v>
<v Speaker 1>motors engine ever and it's going to be </v>

1955
01:28:45.011 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>a cadillac exclusive engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hasn't happened since.</v>

1956
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.090
<v Speaker 1>remember the north star?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the last time kat.</v>

1957
01:28:51.091 --> 01:28:56.091
<v Speaker 1>He got their own motors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it a big deal about it being </v>

1958
01:28:56.091 --> 01:28:56.091
<v Speaker 1>cadillac exclusive for k comerica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go fuck yourself.</v>

1959
01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:01.370
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what cadillac hasn't had </v>
<v Speaker 1>right is right.</v>

1960
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:06.500
<v Speaker 1>You know the cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they actually the ctsv is the </v>

1961
01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:10.581
<v Speaker 1>lightest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest car in its class that as the </v>

1962
01:29:10.581 --> 01:29:10.680
<v Speaker 1>best steering in its class as the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower in his class,</v>

1963
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.800
<v Speaker 1>so making little not sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they can't sell ctsv is they can't </v>

1964
01:29:15.841 --> 01:29:20.841
<v Speaker 1>sell ats fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean no one's buying </v>

1965
01:29:20.841 --> 01:29:20.841
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1966
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure there's a few reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1967
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>the infotainment system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that queue system is really pretty </v>

1968
01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1969
01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Fat dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't make it to the </v>

1970
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:32.900
<v Speaker 1>test drive because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is really like a liability is</v>

1972
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bad.</v>

1973
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rented an escalate and I was going </v>

1974
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>through all that shit to try to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the navigation.</v>

1975
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The toughest bars forever.</v>

1976
01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure it out.</v>

1977
01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 1>How to get the navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you.</v>

1978
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Where's home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fucking home button?</v>

1979
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:54.650
<v Speaker 1>So that that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they switching over to car play now </v>

1980
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.610
<v Speaker 1>or worse than the android or apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone?</v>

1981
01:29:57.611 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get those.</v>

1982
01:29:58.531 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still.</v>

1983
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:04.821
<v Speaker 1>That still doesn't get you around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch buttons and stuff and that he is </v>

1984
01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:08.810
<v Speaker 1>the cta cta to fucking slam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if that actually artist's </v>

1985
01:30:10.441 --> 01:30:12.820
<v Speaker 1>rendering on boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what.</v>

1986
01:30:12.821 --> 01:30:13.370
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

1987
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:18.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the ct six if it looks like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will say cadillac has a really nice </v>

1988
01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 1>history of coming out with very bold </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept cars and then not building them.</v>

1989
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1990
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Seriously make that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have they build end up building </v>

1991
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.970
<v Speaker 1>water down shit for every floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it to.</v>

1992
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Cadillac was always the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my grandfather's day made it.</v>

1993
01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You got a fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can put that back up for a second </v>

1994
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:43.851
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing to me looks like a modern </v>

1995
01:30:43.851 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 1>version of what I felt like a cadillac </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

1996
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not entirely different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bentley flying spur.</v>

1997
01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.010
<v Speaker 1>If you pull up a bentley flying spur </v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks similar,</v>

1998
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:58.190
<v Speaker 1>but that again is a rendering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best look in catalogs </v>

1999
01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.320
<v Speaker 1>rendering like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they make that way because that </v>

2000
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 1>is the best look and cadillac I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

2001
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It's aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean aggressive for american cars.</v>

2002
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Aggressive cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right chrysler 300 saved chrysler.</v>

2003
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:16.100
<v Speaker 1>And when I say best looking cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean best looking new cadillac.</v>

2004
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like the batmobile style </v>

2005
01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.800
<v Speaker 1>old school catalogs because I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it's unfair to compare because the </v>

2006
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.040
<v Speaker 1>details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are works of art.</v>

2007
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what year would that be?</v>

2008
01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Like a 57.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eldorado would be retail custom.</v>

2009
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Fifty seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2010
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and they're like 75 feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big bodies are coming up big.</v>

2011
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slammed on bags,</v>

2012
01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with steel wheels.</v>

2013
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's your fins.</v>

2014
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ as a chopped roof.</v>

2015
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

2016
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:55.740
<v Speaker 1>They've really gone batmobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a bat.</v>

2017
01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2018
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:58.440
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fit man.</v>

2019
01:31:58.441 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I wish you can't bring fins back,</v>

2020
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 2>but that would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday and impact and all.</v>

2021
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is hot.</v>

2022
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 2>That's older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a 55,</v>

2023
01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a custom job.</v>

2024
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:14.800
<v Speaker 2>The bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2025
01:32:14.801 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you roll big body like that?</v>

2026
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:18.710
<v Speaker 2>You have full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big bought.</v>

2027
01:32:18.711 --> 01:32:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would take it out on sunday </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you'd go fuck this car and then</v>

2028
01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you would drive something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually drive because part of the </v>

2029
01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>thrill of driving is the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the road.</v>

2030
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:33.241
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like those cars are not interacting </v>

2031
01:32:33.241 --> 01:32:33.241
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know there's so much weight.</v>

2032
01:32:33.241 --> 01:32:34.390
<v Speaker 2>You're moving them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sloppy.</v>

2033
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like you got into like an old 73</v>
<v Speaker 2>porsche.</v>

2034
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:40.620
<v Speaker 2>You could drive that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2035
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Even like stock from the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could drive that thing.</v>

2036
01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:45.350
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2037
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 2>The american car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older american cars,</v>

2038
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 2>like you have no idea where that limit </v>
<v Speaker 2>is coming.</v>

2039
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there,</v>

2040
01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wheels falling off trees.</v>

2041
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no communication,</v>

2043
01:32:58.121 --> 01:32:59.960
<v Speaker 2>the steering wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old school,</v>

2044
01:32:59.961 --> 01:33:04.961
<v Speaker 2>electric steering is like a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero communication up and I used to be </v>

2045
01:33:04.961 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 2>so afraid of old cars and then I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving old european cars knowing,</v>

2046
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.290
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how this is supposed to go.</v>

2047
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2048
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a product of their environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2049
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Like in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking gem guys that chomp cigars</v>

2050
01:33:19.091 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 2>and they're off the rack shitty suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never left detroit and if you go to</v>

2051
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:27.340
<v Speaker 2>detroit it's just fucking pot holes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's straight lines.</v>

2052
01:33:27.341 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 2>And so of course the cars would ride </v>
<v Speaker 2>like shit and,</v>

2053
01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:35.340
<v Speaker 2>or would float around and not handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there isn't a corner for 300 </v>

2054
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.370
<v Speaker 2>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2055
01:33:36.371 --> 01:33:41.371
<v Speaker 2>now you get the ctsv because these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go to the nurburgring and </v>

2056
01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:41.371
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

2057
01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a global world now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2058
01:33:44.081 --> 01:33:45.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then detroit,</v>

2059
01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:50.940
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these closed minded morons built cars </v>

2060
01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.971
<v Speaker 2>for their own city and sold them all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world with no regard to the </v>

2061
01:33:54.191 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 2>fact that they didn't work for shit in </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2063
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's set up America,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2084
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 2>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2085
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:48.720
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2086
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And that shit's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that looks like gold.</v>

2087
01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:52.950
<v Speaker 2>That's gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that um,</v>

2088
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 2>glass or sapphire crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a crystal and the back end.</v>

2089
01:34:56.921 --> 01:34:57.740
<v Speaker 2>The front?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2090
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

2091
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:58.590
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:00.270
<v Speaker 1>They call that a display back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2093
01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So just you could show piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can admire the hardware within.</v>

2094
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy when you look at the detail </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in one of those watches,</v>

2095
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:10.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of parallels with cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many the they've,</v>

2096
01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rose up in parallel.</v>

2097
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean the obvious connections of </v>
<v Speaker 1>timing,</v>

2098
01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 1>races and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wearing a machine on your wrist.</v>

2099
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.620
<v Speaker 1>That's called self dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I went to advertise my own watch for </v>

2100
01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.110
<v Speaker 1>sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

2101
01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get that.</v>

2102
01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.360
<v Speaker 1>What's that one on the far right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a panorai that lots called a </v>

2103
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.500
<v Speaker 1>retro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a also known as a split second </v>

2104
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.690
<v Speaker 1>chronograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually two coronagraphs laid </v>

2105
01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:47.081
<v Speaker 1>on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be used to measure the time </v>

2106
01:35:47.081 --> 01:35:48.560
<v Speaker 1>differential between say two cars on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racetrack.</v>

2107
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:51.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the most complicated movement.</v>

2108
01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Panoramics I think that was about 13 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>14 grand.</v>

2109
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice watch.</v>

2110
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a demo.</v>

2111
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I sent it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it back,</v>

2112
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:01.650
<v Speaker 1>send it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent,</v>

2113
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I said most of them I send them back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to giving them 10 grand a month.</v>

2114
01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that how it works?</v>

2115
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The part of my,</v>

2116
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a sponsorship deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crown and caliber.com.</v>

2117
01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:14.490
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2118
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.640
<v Speaker 1>what is the sponsorship deal like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>

2119
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started this watch podcasts,</v>

2120
01:36:18.791 --> 01:36:21.530
<v Speaker 1>so they're our title sponsor so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me a budget for a year,</v>

2121
01:36:21.531 --> 01:36:26.531
<v Speaker 1>but I can also loan out watches out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their stock if I so desire to try </v>

2122
01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.340
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a chick trying on jewelry.</v>

2123
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Jewelry for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2124

<v Speaker 1>It's the only jewelry that you can kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of get away with.</v>

2127

2128
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:42.310

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's great having a guy like you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk cars.</v>

2149
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is crying.</v>

2150
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>

2151
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I've done so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of my life.</v>

2152
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's normal.</v>

2153
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The working out stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if I don't do it,</v>

2154
01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't do the other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go crazy.</v>

2155
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I won't be balanced and I want to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

2156
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems that you seem to churn out a</v>

2157
01:37:48.081 --> 01:37:53.081
<v Speaker 1>large volume of content and you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel ufc and all that kind of stuff </v>

2158
01:37:53.511 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's a of content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unit</v>

2159
01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:57.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me the universe rewards,</v>

2160
01:37:57.781 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 2>hustle while it does I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2161
01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I have that engraved on the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first rolex.</v>

2162
01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I bought myself a really good for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>matches from you.</v>

2163
01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:09.860
<v Speaker 2>That's dope and I sort of lived on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mantra for quite a long time until I </v>

2164
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:15.230
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually just totally burned myself </v>

2165
01:38:15.230 --> 01:38:15.230
<v Speaker 2>out on it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can burn yourself out.</v>

2166
01:38:15.230 --> 01:38:17.850
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real conscious of how your body feels.</v>

2167
01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I like about what </v>

2168
01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.921
<v Speaker 2>you've been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing cardio seven days a </v>

2169
01:38:24.921 --> 01:38:26.991
<v Speaker 2>week and that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent so much time working and </v>

2170
01:38:26.991 --> 01:38:26.991
<v Speaker 2>focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2171
01:38:26.991 --> 01:38:28.800
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I can stand and lift my arms,</v>

2172
01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep making videos because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit could all end tomorrow,</v>

2173
01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 2>but my body completely fell apart and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go,</v>

2174
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:38.700
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's time to take care of this.</v>

2175
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sTick with it.</v>

2176
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Here's a car analogy here because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your vehicle and the difference </v>

2177
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.311
<v Speaker 2>between having a 500 horsepower engine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a hundred and 25 horsepower diesel </v>

2178
01:38:49.311 --> 01:38:54.200
<v Speaker 2>is literally how you take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and if you can turn your body into a </v>

2179
01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:59.151
<v Speaker 2>race car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't unless you know </v>

2180
01:38:59.151 --> 01:38:59.151
<v Speaker 2>obviously have disability or something's</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with you,</v>

2181
01:38:59.151 --> 01:39:00.770
<v Speaker 2>but for most people the issue is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

2182
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 2>will in their mind and discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then knowledge,</v>

2183
01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 2>right standing how to do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've lost large amounts of weight </v>

2184
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.851
<v Speaker 2>several times in the past I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost 50 pounds and then I lost a </v>

2185
01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>hundred pounds and then I lost this past</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>

2186
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 2>another 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I know how to do it.</v>

2187
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:23.450
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing now differently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the difference with this one is I </v>

2188
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:27.471
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do it every time I've done it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past it has drastically </v>

2189
01:39:27.471 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 2>interrupted my day to day life.</v>

2190
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like either you go to fat camp and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it or you,</v>

2191
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:34.780
<v Speaker 2>it takes away from something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>

2193
01:39:34.781 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 2>it was much more important to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a job,</v>

2194
01:39:37.891 --> 01:39:42.891
<v Speaker 2>I have a life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure out how to make this </v>

2195
01:39:42.891 --> 01:39:45.501
<v Speaker 2>work in within that life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it became a lot more hotel gyms </v>

2196
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 2>really doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really making sure to just do that shit.</v>

2197
01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the road,</v>

2198
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 2>the road is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 2>It's hard with diet too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard.</v>

2200
01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:57.150
<v Speaker 2>I don'T.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't change my diet that much.</v>

2201
01:39:57.151 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I just started exercising a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My big problem wasn't that I ate badly.</v>

2202
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:07.330
<v Speaker 2>It's that I would eat big meals spaced </v>
<v Speaker 2>very far apart and so my body would go </v>

2203
01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:11.781
<v Speaker 2>into like storage mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I try and eat smaller meals and </v>

2204
01:40:11.781 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 2>more of them and it seems to work much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more efficiently.</v>

2205
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's body is different,</v>

2206
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest,</v>

2207
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:20.910
<v Speaker 2>most significant things that you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is cut out most sugar.</v>

2208
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Cut out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most refined carbohydrates.</v>

2209
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Red is my achilles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody I love bread out.</v>

2210
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Weight would fly off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2211
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.710
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're telling me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>volume of exercise you're doing.</v>

2212
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut out the bread,</v>

2213
01:40:32.971 --> 01:40:37.971
<v Speaker 2>cut out the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would lose ridiculous amounts of </v>

2214
01:40:37.971 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know Jordan Peterson was on my podcast.</v>

2215
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:43.911
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about autoimmune issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had and what he did was cut out </v>

2216
01:40:43.911 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 2>everything except for meat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>

2217
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.760
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all his problems went away.</v>

2218
01:40:47.761 --> 01:40:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2226

<v Speaker 3>fucking love bread so much and I just </v>

2227

<v Speaker 3>don't want to kill myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2228
01:41:07.991 --> 01:41:12.991

<v Speaker 3>It's like it's like growing a show or </v>

2229
01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:16.591
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the curve is going in the right </v>

2230
01:41:16.591 --> 01:41:19.531
<v Speaker 3>direction and I'm okaY pushing forward,</v>

2234
01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:29.070

<v Speaker 3>Think about saying that you don't want </v>

2235

<v Speaker 3>to kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>meatballs because it's dinner,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is what I take home from this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I take home the cheat day </v>

<v Speaker 3>The other thing is your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get into that habit,</v>

2264
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.190
<v Speaker 3>your body won't be craving those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore because a lot of the reasons why</v>

2265
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:41.191
<v Speaker 3>you crave it is because your gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>bacteria that's being supported by that </v>

2266
01:42:41.191 --> 01:42:44.401
<v Speaker 3>diet and then you sort of go into gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>bacteria withdrawals and that makes you </v>

2267
01:42:44.401 --> 01:42:45.570
<v Speaker 3>want more and blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2268
01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to do is get your a biome in</v>

2269
01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like start eating a lot of probiotics.</v>

2270
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can stomach kimchi.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I like the taste.</v>

2272
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean I like korean food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much I can eat.</v>

2273
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Kimchi is a daily thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2274
01:43:01.151 --> 01:43:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acidophilus.</v>

2275
01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.610
<v Speaker 3>A yogurt is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could eat yogurt,</v>

2276
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:10.500
<v Speaker 3>you have the time to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To find these kids.</v>

2277
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Go to the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes 10 minutes.</v>

2280
01:43:17.261 --> 01:43:22.261
<v Speaker 3>this is why I'm surprised at how you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How well you do it because running </v>

2281
01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:24.991
<v Speaker 3>around this city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have a whole day that's three </v>

2282
01:43:24.991 --> 01:43:29.131
<v Speaker 3>activities and it takes all day to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>those activities and you barely have </v>

2283
01:43:29.131 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 3>time to eat in between the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just bad at bringing that stuff with</v>

2284
01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:32.660
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:34.930

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.140
<v Speaker 3>whether it's bars or kimchi or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring it with me so that they don't </v>

2287
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:41.200
<v Speaker 3>get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then murder.</v>

2320
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:57.440

<v Speaker 1>they were doing them there.</v>

2321
01:44:57.441 --> 01:44:59.720
<v Speaker 1>They were turning the quail breasts into</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nuggets,</v>

2322
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 1>nuggets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a quail breast.</v>

2323
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2324
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 1>like the drumsticks banging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely delicious.</v>

2325
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And what did they cook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2326
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:08.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say mcnugget,</v>

2327
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:10.820
<v Speaker 1>so they breaded that breaded and fried </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2328
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a whole quail breast was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pop it in your mouth nugget.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a delicious meat.</v>

2330
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy,</v>

2332
01:45:18.710 --> 01:45:20.360
<v Speaker 1>crazy tasty birds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:25.390
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like super conflicted about the </v>

2334
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 1>hunting portion of it and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I felt I,</v>

2335
01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:30.290
<v Speaker 1>my dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like fishing was likely not,</v>

2336
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not like fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't feel as guilty as I thought</v>

2337
01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2338
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2339
01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is a crazy thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna say it anyway,</v>

2340
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an old relationship like to </v>

2341
01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2342
01:45:48.061 --> 01:45:53.061
<v Speaker 1>like you run into an old girlfriend on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street and you haven't seen her </v>

2343
01:45:53.061 --> 01:45:55.350
<v Speaker 1>since 1989 or somewhere to see where </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going.</v>

2344
01:45:55.351 --> 01:45:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it is a long time ago.</v>

2345
01:45:57.541 --> 01:46:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And you run into each other and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking to each other like,</v>

2346
01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:02.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you.</v>

2347
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I broke up with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2348
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just you,</v>

2349
01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:12.861
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relationship with a hunting an </v>

2350
01:46:12.861 --> 01:46:12.861
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

2351
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.880
<v Speaker 3>People feel it very quickly with fishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because fishing carries very little </v>

2352
01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:17.880
<v Speaker 3>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people like,</v>

2353
01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:18.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it hurt?</v>

2354
01:46:18.930 --> 01:46:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it going to get her?</v>

2355
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Some people get like that with fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't give a fuck about </v>

2356
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little kids.</v>

2357
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:29.810
<v Speaker 3>TheY laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids laugh and it's like this </v>

2358
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:31.920
<v Speaker 3>flopping and die fish has a fucking hook</v>
<v Speaker 3>through its head and my seven year old </v>

2359
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 3>thinks it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

2360
01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.600
<v Speaker 3>she's so happy that this thing is dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2361
01:46:39.601 --> 01:46:41.870
<v Speaker 3>But if that was a rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had never had that reaction.</v>

2362
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2363
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:45.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a natural thing that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2364
01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2365
01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:51.530
<v Speaker 3>We have a hierarchy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that closest to us we feel more </v>

2366
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:54.120
<v Speaker 3>connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't feel connected at all to bugs.</v>

2367
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a fuck about vegan slap </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes all day long.</v>

2368
01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a shit about that life.</v>

2369
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.700
<v Speaker 3>But there is a life that you care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>when things get warm and they get too </v>

2370
01:47:05.371 --> 01:47:06.670
<v Speaker 3>close to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:47:06.671 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 3>When they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they get too close to malmo,</v>

2372
01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:09.510
<v Speaker 3>like people freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:47:09.511 --> 01:47:14.511
<v Speaker 3>I went on a south african safari last </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and it was like I couldn't fathom </v>

2374
01:47:14.851 --> 01:47:17.640
<v Speaker 3>someone going and hunting a leopard or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2375
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big game.</v>

2376
01:47:19.471 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very weird thing.</v>

2377
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:22.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2378
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:23.890
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2379
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:28.560
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like what that is and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not saying it's just sadism,</v>

2380
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little about what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like it's an aberration off the </v>

2381
01:47:34.831 --> 01:47:39.831
<v Speaker 3>original idea and this is the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at it and people would get mad </v>

2382
01:47:39.831 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 3>at me that are hunters because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter and like,</v>

2383
01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:41.010
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2384
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:46.190
<v Speaker 3>it's not the thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and last year doing it on just to </v>

2385
01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:47.610
<v Speaker 3>control population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to do it,</v>

2386
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:50.630
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>

2387
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.700
<v Speaker 3>What happened was in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only reason people hunted was from </v>

2388
01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:56.240
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2389
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 3>You barely could stay alive anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you went on a hunting party,</v>

2390
01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.310
<v Speaker 3>he didn't go for sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went to go to kill things.</v>

2391
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.640
<v Speaker 3>When you have so much food that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't need to worry about food and </v>

2392
01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.030
<v Speaker 3>you've already been shooting all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2393
01:48:09.031 --> 01:48:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Then they start doing these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>called slams.</v>

2394
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 3>They call doing super slams are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grand slam.</v>

2395
01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:17.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a doll sheep slammed as a sheep </v>
<v Speaker 3>slam,</v>

2396
01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 3>a rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big horn sheep slammed.</v>

2397
01:48:20.401 --> 01:48:22.270
<v Speaker 3>there's like a jam burry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2398
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2399
01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:28.060
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to kill one representative of </v>

2400
01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:28.620
<v Speaker 3>each of the subspecies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My god.</v>

2401
01:48:28.621 --> 01:48:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big thing with these guys.</v>

2403
01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Got poker run calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the the big six are the big eight </v>

2404

<v Speaker 3>It's like it gets to this weird place </v>

2421
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.790
<v Speaker 3>like you don't think they shouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2422
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2423
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Are you eating the Turkey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

2424
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

2425
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Are you eating the deer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2426
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then I have no quarrel,</v>

2427
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:26.960
<v Speaker 3>but when you start going like leopard </v>
<v Speaker 3>lion was.</v>

2428
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I said cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elephant was the other one.</v>

2429
01:49:28.861 --> 01:49:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2430
01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:34.730
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the only reason why you shoot an </v>

2431
01:49:34.730 --> 01:49:36.651
<v Speaker 3>elephant is if the elephants going on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rampage through our village people and </v>

2432
01:49:36.651 --> 01:49:37.950
<v Speaker 3>you want to protect people's lives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on team people.</v>

2433
01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck else would you shoot an </v>

2434
01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:43.130
<v Speaker 3>elephant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

2435
01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I saw an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest elephant I've ever seen as </v>

2436
01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.160
<v Speaker 3>far away from me as you were sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2437
01:49:49.170 --> 01:49:54.170
<v Speaker 3>My god and I almost had a harder to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in africa on a safari see,</v>

2438
01:49:54.971 --> 01:49:57.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think those things are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

2439
01:49:57.641 --> 01:50:02.641
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you just know what you're </v>

2440
01:50:02.641 --> 01:50:05.341
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason I was so close is because we </v>

2441
01:50:05.341 --> 01:50:07.060
<v Speaker 3>were watching them push trees down with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their trunks,</v>

2442
01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:11.690
<v Speaker 3>like four or five inch trees just from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>

2443
01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Like it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2444
01:50:14.591 --> 01:50:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd crash a car if you hit one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2445
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it would crash the car and like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just phone phone and they're right next </v>

2446
01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:24.460
<v Speaker 3>to you and if they go on your jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the end of that.</v>

2447
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what's complicated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was trying to explain this to me</v>

2448
01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:32.071
<v Speaker 3>and I should really be honest about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was trying to explain to me that </v>

2449
01:50:32.071 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 3>when we think of africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think of a country,</v>

2450
01:50:32.741 --> 01:50:37.741
<v Speaker 3>it's not a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a continent and it's way bigger </v>

2451
01:50:37.741 --> 01:50:37.741
<v Speaker 3>concepts in north America.</v>

2452
01:50:37.741 --> 01:50:39.370
<v Speaker 3>We've seen pictures of United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in the middle of africa.</v>

2453
01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Africa is fucking huge and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

2454
01:50:42.251 --> 01:50:47.251
<v Speaker 3>there's places in africa where they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>over populations of elephants and they </v>

2455
01:50:47.251 --> 01:50:50.911
<v Speaker 3>encroach on human civilization and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do have to hire hunters to come in and </v>

2456
01:50:50.911 --> 01:50:51.490
<v Speaker 3>do it and kill them or they don't hire </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2457
01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.820
<v Speaker 3>The hunters pay and the money goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight to the village.</v>

2458
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:59.821
<v Speaker 3>The meat goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the village and people get very excited </v>

2459
01:50:59.821 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 3>about people huntIng these elephants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2460
01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 3>when I hear that seems like a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>short term solution to the village right</v>

2461
01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:08.690
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The village doesn't give a shit about </v>

2462
01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:08.690
<v Speaker 3>the elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want their,</v>

2463
01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 3>they want to eat probably right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They agency eat their crops but becomes </v>

2464
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:13.400
<v Speaker 3>a big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2465
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 3>and they beat the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2466
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:18.950
<v Speaker 3>like good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only keep guiding them.</v>

2467
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Lfo now have no chance.</v>

2468
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:23.320
<v Speaker 3>So when someone was explaining this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2469
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I remember we were saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2470
01:51:25.541 --> 01:51:27.340
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck would you ever want to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>an elephant?</v>

2471
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.890
<v Speaker 3>We know there's not that many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2472
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:31.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why it's complicated.</v>

2473
01:51:31.661 --> 01:51:36.661
<v Speaker 3>There's not that many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some places it's like in la there's </v>

2474
01:51:36.661 --> 01:51:37.490
<v Speaker 3>no grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2475
01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:42.720
<v Speaker 3>But if you go to Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that live in Montana are </v>

2476
01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.030
<v Speaker 3>going to start hunting these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2477
01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 3>They just declared them open for a in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming.</v>

2478
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:50.240
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have.</v>

2479
01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:55.260
<v Speaker 3>They think they just started a hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>season and it's very controversial and </v>

2480
01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:56.580
<v Speaker 3>they just end date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2481
01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:58.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not anymore at all.</v>

2482
01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Now they have a lot of them and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that lIve up there,</v>

2483
01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:06.451
<v Speaker 3>especially people that have been mauled </v>
<v Speaker 3>or know people that have been mauled to </v>

2484
01:52:06.451 --> 01:52:06.451
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey fucking enough.</v>

2485
01:52:06.650 --> 01:52:08.510
<v Speaker 3>And now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2486
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:11.440
<v Speaker 3>they made a great comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2487
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 3>if you're in chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's zero bears.</v>

2488
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:19.770
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a tiny place in comparison </v>

2489
01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:19.770
<v Speaker 3>to africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I was saying that like I thought</v>

2490
01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:21.430
<v Speaker 3>that elephants were endangered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2491
01:52:21.431 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 3>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're are endangered in some areas and</v>

2492
01:52:25.451 --> 01:52:30.451
<v Speaker 3>good point to fucked up point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most dark point about all of it is </v>

2493
01:52:30.451 --> 01:52:34.240
<v Speaker 3>that trophy hunting is the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that keeps those animals healthy.</v>

2494
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:39.270
<v Speaker 3>This is what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about playing campaigns </v>

2495
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:40.360
<v Speaker 3>about this this weekend when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I say,</v>

2496
01:52:40.361 --> 01:52:45.361
<v Speaker 3>trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm even talking about normal hunting </v>

2497
01:52:45.361 --> 01:52:46.920
<v Speaker 3>for meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like impalas or you know elan's these,</v>

2498
01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:50.360
<v Speaker 3>these big game animals that people hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>for because they're delicious.</v>

2499
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Even them in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of areas in Zimbabwe that </v>

2500
01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 3>are not high fence.</v>

2501
01:52:56.750 --> 01:53:01.750
<v Speaker 3>They're Just open enormous areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the money that would come from </v>

2502
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:04.520
<v Speaker 3>people hunting there would sustain these</v>
<v Speaker 3>local areas,</v>

2503
01:53:04.521 --> 01:53:09.521
<v Speaker 3>sustain these lodges so it make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>viable to keep these animals alive and </v>

2504
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:12.220
<v Speaker 3>stop poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big bonds.</v>

2505
01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Speaker 3>The anti poaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2506
01:53:13.611 --> 01:53:18.611
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that funds the anti </v>

2507
01:53:18.611 --> 01:53:18.611
<v Speaker 3>poaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happened.</v>

2508
01:53:18.611 --> 01:53:19.250
<v Speaker 3>The cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion shit went down.</v>

2509
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted to go to africa anymore to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go hunting and all of these businesses </v>

2510
01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.440
<v Speaker 3>are going under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's nothing stopping the poachers</v>

2511
01:53:26.441 --> 01:53:28.700
<v Speaker 3>so the poachers move in and kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

2512
01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:31.650
<v Speaker 3>kill everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone the other way.</v>

2513
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:34.220
<v Speaker 3>How many elephants were killed last year</v>
<v Speaker 3>by people?</v>

2514
01:53:34.221 --> 01:53:39.221
<v Speaker 3>something like 400 or google this </v>
<v Speaker 3>legally killed elephants.</v>

2515
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.550
<v Speaker 3>The number of illegally killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants.</v>

2516
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 3>$30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2517
01:53:45.651 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 3>30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are killed illegally.</v>

2518
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are poached.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this one elephant,</v>

2519
01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:54.740
<v Speaker 3>you know that last elephant that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying the mail,</v>

2520
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:55.740
<v Speaker 3>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhino,</v>

2521
01:53:55.741 --> 01:53:57.830
<v Speaker 3>rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white rhino or black rhino,</v>

2522
01:53:57.831 --> 01:53:59.120
<v Speaker 3>which was in a black rhino.</v>

2523
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I think they have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That poor bastard with armed guards </v>

2524
01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.081
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four slash seven because they </v>

2525
01:54:08.081 --> 01:54:10.481
<v Speaker 3>were worried someone's going to kill it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shoot it and chop the fucking horn </v>

2526
01:54:10.481 --> 01:54:13.361
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the poaching is way scarier than </v>

2527
01:54:13.361 --> 01:54:16.391
<v Speaker 3>the hunting and the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>protects the animals from poaching is </v>

2528
01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:18.970
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds so weird and so forth,</v>

2529
01:54:18.971 --> 01:54:20.770
<v Speaker 3>but you have to look at it honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 3>They said something similar to us in </v>
<v Speaker 3>South Africa,</v>

2531
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.160
<v Speaker 3>both that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2532
01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:27.500
<v Speaker 3>that they need the funds because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti poachers,</v>

2533
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:28.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2534
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2535
01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:32.240
<v Speaker 3>they're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then here's the other problem.</v>

2536
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:35.150
<v Speaker 3>When you say poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these poachers,</v>

2537
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you know what you're really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people.</v>

2538
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're really saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're poor,</v>

2539
01:54:39.321 --> 01:54:44.321
<v Speaker 3>desperate people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what the fuck to do and </v>

2540
01:54:44.321 --> 01:54:44.321
<v Speaker 3>if they could chop off a rhino's horn </v>
<v Speaker 3>and make some money,</v>

2541
01:54:44.321 --> 01:54:44.450
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do it.</v>

2542
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:47.720
<v Speaker 3>If they can shoot that animal that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>theirs and use it for me,</v>

2543
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're starving to death.</v>

2544
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have no options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's appears people in parts of </v>

2545
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 3>africa that are living in grass huts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My buddy justin wren,</v>

2546
01:54:55.941 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes and makes wells for these people</v>

2547
01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:03.401
<v Speaker 3>in the Congo and the stories he tells </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just make your eyes tear up </v>

2548
01:55:03.401 --> 01:55:06.760
<v Speaker 3>these human beings and they're living </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this 24 hours a day for their </v>

2549
01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.430
<v Speaker 3>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

2550
01:55:07.431 --> 01:55:10.250
<v Speaker 3>this is the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking about poachers will.</v>

2551
01:55:10.251 --> 01:55:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking desperate.</v>

2552
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can call them poachers,</v>

2553
01:55:14.271 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 3>you could dehumanize them with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>term,</v>

2554
01:55:16.581 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 3>but they're just poor people and none of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2555
01:55:19.521 --> 01:55:22.550
<v Speaker 3>The movie stereotype poachers somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them,</v>

2556
01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:24.890
<v Speaker 3>but most of them aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here's what's even crazier.</v>

2557
01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Most of the anti poaching agents used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be poachers because there's nothing else</v>

2558
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:31.630
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2559
01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 3>that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>NoW they're poachers again,</v>

2560
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:35.920
<v Speaker 3>because they put their hunting people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who they got out of jail,</v>

2561
01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:40.410
<v Speaker 3>they got out of this position that can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>be [inaudible] because they can now.</v>

2562
01:55:40.411 --> 01:55:42.590
<v Speaker 3>They just got back from poachers again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

2563
01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 3>This happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it's gone well,</v>

2564
01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 2>so when campaigns was explaining this to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and when does it explain it to me?</v>

2565
01:55:47.431 --> 01:55:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2566
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't even know how many animals</v>

2567
01:55:49.651 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 2>are left in these areas where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have abandoned them.</v>

2568
01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Ranches that were once thriving ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see.</v>

2569
01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 2>The thing is most of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good percentage of it,</v>

2570
01:55:57.291 --> 01:56:02.291
<v Speaker 2>we're on the verge of extinction just 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago because people were just over </v>

2571
01:56:02.291 --> 01:56:02.790
<v Speaker 2>hunting them and poaching them and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want it to him.</v>

2572
01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Then they started putting value on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would go over there to hunt them </v>

2573
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 2>so people would keep these huge areas </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2574
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 2>That population boomed because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking care of them because they were.</v>

2575
01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:14.900
<v Speaker 2>They were A resource and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is key.</v>

2576
01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 2>This is conflicting to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild.</v>

2577
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It's very wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went to the galapagos on a </v>

2578
01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:22.520
<v Speaker 2>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting.</v>

2579
01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you're kind of spot.</v>

2580
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't kill anything.</v>

2581
01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

2582
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like Hawaii if there were never </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2583
01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an.</v>

2584
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:36.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely empty Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big is it?</v>

2585
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:40.440
<v Speaker 2>About the same size as Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big island or chain of.</v>

2586
01:56:40.441 --> 01:56:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a chain of islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably 13 or 15 islands.</v>

2587
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2588
01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 2>None as bIg as the big island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most the buildings on them,</v>

2589
01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:54.030
<v Speaker 2>there are two or three like towns wIth </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 25,000</v>

2590
01:56:54.031 --> 01:56:56.850
<v Speaker 2>people and the rest of it is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>National park,</v>

2591
01:56:56.851 --> 01:57:01.851
<v Speaker 2>97 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they talk about these giant </v>

2592
01:57:01.851 --> 01:57:01.880
<v Speaker 2>tortoises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2593
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:06.950
<v Speaker 2>and there were like potentially a half a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million of them on the islands and it </v>

2594
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:10.971
<v Speaker 2>went down to like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they found like a fall last one and</v>

2595
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:16.941
<v Speaker 2>they tried to breed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like three varieties of </v>

2596
01:57:16.941 --> 01:57:19.131
<v Speaker 2>tortoises and the one of them got down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to one and they tried to save it and </v>

2597
01:57:19.131 --> 01:57:19.131
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't save it.</v>

2598
01:57:19.131 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:23.190
<v Speaker 2>embalmed fucking taxidermy on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>galapagos islands,</v>

2600
01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:28.191
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these giant tortoises that lived at 200 </v>

2601
01:57:28.191 --> 01:57:28.191
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2602
01:57:28.191 --> 01:57:33.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the passing ships would just like </v>

2603
01:57:33.110 --> 01:57:35.150
<v Speaker 2>grab a few of them and they'd eat them </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ships and they'd completely </v>

2604
01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:38.721
<v Speaker 2>decimated the entire population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all gone and they're trying to </v>

2605
01:57:38.721 --> 01:57:38.721
<v Speaker 2>bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know why we started here.</v>

2606
01:57:38.721 --> 01:57:40.650
<v Speaker 2>But will they take forever to grow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2607
01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have 100 years old.</v>

2608
01:57:43.330 --> 01:57:44.650
<v Speaker 2>They live 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:49.910
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole rest of the islands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's crazy about them as nothing has </v>

2610
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 2>been hunted there in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the wild animals have no problem with</v>

2611
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:55.020
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

2612
01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Like your face to face with sea lions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

2613
01:57:58.230 --> 01:58:03.230
<v Speaker 2>I could be to like birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of wild bird would let </v>

2614
01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:07.611
<v Speaker 2>you get within a foot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's these giant blue footed </v>

2615
01:58:07.611 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 2>boobies that have no problem with you.</v>

2616
01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:11.370
<v Speaker 2>just being right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching them like where they can have a</v>

2617
01:58:11.371 --> 01:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>baby right there and they won't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with you.</v>

2618
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like huge lizards and underwater.</v>

2619
01:58:17.221 --> 01:58:20.640
<v Speaker 2>The densIty of the underwater sea life </v>
<v Speaker 2>was insane.</v>

2620
01:58:20.641 --> 01:58:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Hammerhead sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a baby hammerhead shark is the </v>

2621
01:58:25.641 --> 01:58:28.110
<v Speaker 2>cutest animal I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baby hammerhead like this.</v>

2622
01:58:28.210 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Why the why they developed their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there on the end site that </v>

2623
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 2>presumably it's like an echo location or</v>
<v Speaker 2>or radar sonar type of thing.</v>

2624
01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It gives you better range I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they are in darker waters.</v>

2625
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're</v>

2626
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool to see in person though.</v>

2627
01:58:44.410 --> 01:58:49.410
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like a hammerhead shark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't the galapagos where they had that </v>

2628
01:58:49.410 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 3>thing that they were doing with judas </v>
<v Speaker 3>goats?</v>

2629
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2630
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:54.010
<v Speaker 3>That is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The goats.</v>

2631
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2632
01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:00.120
<v Speaker 3>captain cook dropped off a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>goats on those islands and they did it </v>

2633
01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.350
<v Speaker 3>so that when they came back they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to hunt and the goats go over.</v>

2634
01:59:02.351 --> 01:59:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Ran the island and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2635
01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:10.170
<v Speaker 3>that was a big problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're eating everything and then </v>

2636
01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:12.660
<v Speaker 3>everything in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what did they do with the </v>

2637
01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:12.660
<v Speaker 3>judas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judas goes,</v>

2638
01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:13.640
<v Speaker 3>had like a disease or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2639
01:59:13.641 --> 01:59:14.100
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2640
01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:14.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2641
01:59:14.951 --> 01:59:19.951
<v Speaker 3>they took one of them and they say they </v>
<v Speaker 3>neutered him and then they sent him out </v>

2642
01:59:19.951 --> 01:59:24.541
<v Speaker 3>with a radio collar on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he find out where all their other </v>

2643
01:59:24.541 --> 01:59:24.541
<v Speaker 3>goats are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would gunned them down.</v>

2644
01:59:24.541 --> 01:59:26.740
<v Speaker 3>HelIcopters and they would keep him </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

2645
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.260
<v Speaker 3>They would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the judas goat.</v>

2646
01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:33.261
<v Speaker 3>We keep him alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've got all these goods down </v>

2647
01:59:33.261 --> 01:59:33.261
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will move,</v>

2648
01:59:33.261 --> 01:59:33.261
<v Speaker 3>kill all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

2649
01:59:33.261 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 3>makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move rooms.</v>

2650
01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:39.240
<v Speaker 3>And he would go and make some new </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and then they would locate that </v>

2651
01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:40.810
<v Speaker 3>new path because otherwise it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to locate packs that goats,</v>

2652
01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:43.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're really going to put a dent in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the population,</v>

2653
01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.850
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to wipe them all out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2654
01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:47.040
<v Speaker 3>there was they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed like 75,000</v>

2655
01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:48.760
<v Speaker 3>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a crazy number of goats,</v>

2656
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:52.510
<v Speaker 3>but they were completely overruNning the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole the whole thing.</v>

2657
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2658
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 3>train sharpshooters from we're sending </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters.</v>

2659
01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Scoured goats once found the goatS would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be shot from the air,</v>

2660
02:00:00.251 --> 02:00:02.320
<v Speaker 3>either in the head of the heart to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ensure a quick death,</v>

2661
02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using the stop lying.</v>

2662
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:09.610
<v Speaker 3>They never caught him in the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes shot in the face.</v>

2663
02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:11.740
<v Speaker 3>They shot him everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could there in a helicopter.</v>

2664
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:16.741
<v Speaker 3>You not even a steady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to that place so I can keep </v>

2665
02:00:16.741 --> 02:00:18.661
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me you know they're not even in a </v>

2666
02:00:18.661 --> 02:00:18.661
<v Speaker 3>steady place where they can steadily </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot.</v>

2667
02:00:18.661 --> 02:00:19.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a good rest from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>

2668
02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.770
<v Speaker 3>They had mini guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gun in those fuckers down.</v>

2669
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Why lie like that in the heart or in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>head to ensure clicked around using high</v>

2670
02:00:30.851 --> 02:00:35.851
<v Speaker 3>powered weapons and military precision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop with your military precision who </v>

2671
02:00:35.851 --> 02:00:37.150
<v Speaker 3>wrote this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many people,</v>

2672
02:00:37.151 --> 02:00:42.151
<v Speaker 3>including the plans orchestrators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had Misgivings about such a large scale </v>

2673
02:00:42.151 --> 02:00:45.361
<v Speaker 3>slaughter of goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoever the decision was made that the </v>

2674
02:00:45.361 --> 02:00:47.491
<v Speaker 3>galapagos ecosystem under the threat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>under threat found nowhere else on earth</v>

2675
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:49.540
<v Speaker 3>was valuable enough to justify their </v>
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>

2676
02:00:49.541 --> 02:00:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are invasive species.</v>

2677
02:00:51.101 --> 02:00:53.790
<v Speaker 3>History was written by the winners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

2678
02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that they're essentially </v>

2679
02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.850
<v Speaker 3>preparing for people who are animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights activists writing this.</v>

2680
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.540
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2681
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.510
<v Speaker 3>they're shooting them with such </v>
<v Speaker 3>precision.</v>

2682
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's actually very funny because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2683
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:09.460
<v Speaker 3>to the galapagos is ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrictive.</v>

2684
02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:14.520
<v Speaker 3>You cannot set foot on a beach like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there without being like without a </v>

2685
02:01:15.911 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 3>naturalist with you the whole time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be more than like 50 feet from</v>

2686
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:21.790
<v Speaker 3>the naturalistic ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>HOw'd you guys do it?</v>

2687
02:01:21.791 --> 02:01:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Did you hire someone to organized a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

2688
02:01:25.301 --> 02:01:28.840
<v Speaker 3>It was a smallish yacht with like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on it.</v>

2689
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I heard they check your shoes to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds and you rinse off the bottom of </v>

2690
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:36.960
<v Speaker 3>your shoes and then they hand sanitize </v>
<v Speaker 3>you when you get back on the boats.</v>

2691
02:01:36.970 --> 02:01:41.970
<v Speaker 3>They said they've had real issues with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have tramped on on plants </v>

2692
02:01:41.970 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>and then come to the galapagos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now those plants grow there.</v>

2693
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2694
02:01:43.401 --> 02:01:47.390
<v Speaker 3>there's one island that has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was expecting tropical,</v>

2695
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.730
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because hawaii's kind of tropical,</v>

2696
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 3>none of them plants fucking native.</v>

2697
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 3>the ne like none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the jungle plants were brought </v>

2698
02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:01.211
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the galapagos has one island that </v>

2699
02:02:01.211 --> 02:02:04.571
<v Speaker 3>has jungle on it and all of the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them are like volcanic rock and cactuses</v>

2700
02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:06.860
<v Speaker 3>and shrubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2701
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 3>NoT what I expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2702
02:02:09.351 --> 02:02:12.500
<v Speaker 3>how come this island has a jungle on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the rest of them they said,</v>

2703
02:02:12.501 --> 02:02:14.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these plants are not native.</v>

2704
02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:16.130
<v Speaker 3>They were all brought here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the 17 hundreds.</v>

2705
02:02:17.050 --> 02:02:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2706
02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the plants that were brought there,</v>

2707
02:02:21.021 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 3>like those plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2708
02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't.</v>

2709
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that.</v>

2710
02:02:25.581 --> 02:02:27.950
<v Speaker 3>But it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like an artist's rendering to</v>

2711
02:02:27.951 --> 02:02:32.951
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at this crazy tree that </v>

2712
02:02:32.951 --> 02:02:32.951
<v Speaker 3>looks like it's right out of the lord of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rings.</v>

2713
02:02:32.951 --> 02:02:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Dragon's blood tree is what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an awesome name for that.</v>

2714
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Want that shit in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got a big building here.</v>

2715
02:02:37.371 --> 02:02:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Can we get one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need a dragon blood tree in my life.</v>

2716
02:02:40.101 --> 02:02:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>avatar island that floats.</v>

2717
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one that floated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2718
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the greatest looking tree I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>

2719
02:02:49.610 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 3>It was very cool tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird economy,</v>

2720
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:54.170
<v Speaker 3>but the same naturalists that were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2721
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:59.410
<v Speaker 3>preserve everything are giddy when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about shooting goats from a </v>

2722
02:02:59.410 --> 02:02:59.540
<v Speaker 3>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2723
02:02:59.541 --> 02:03:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2724
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.300
<v Speaker 3>they look at the goats is what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are.</v>

2725
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 3>They're an invasive species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there life lifeforms and the,</v>

2726
02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not their fault that they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I was trying to explain to my </v>

2727
02:03:10.630 --> 02:03:13.661
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy of mine who's a thinking </v>

2728
02:03:13.661 --> 02:03:13.661
<v Speaker 3>about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He eats meat and he's like,</v>

2729
02:03:13.661 --> 02:03:16.820
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not going to kill my own meat,</v>

2730
02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.810
<v Speaker 3>like why should I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I have the right to eat meats</v>

2731
02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 3>and this weird moral thing?</v>

2732
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:22.880
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about being vegan,</v>

2733
02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 3>but I know it's not the right move for </v>
<v Speaker 3>my health.</v>

2734
02:03:24.591 --> 02:03:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should try it.</v>

2735
02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:27.410
<v Speaker 3>See if it's the right move for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

2736
02:03:27.411 --> 02:03:30.260
<v Speaker 3>It might work good for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to shoot something,</v>

2737
02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:34.220
<v Speaker 3>the thing to shoot would be wild pigs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have three,</v>

2738
02:03:34.221 --> 02:03:36.110
<v Speaker 3>four litters a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each one of them,</v>

2739
02:03:36.111 --> 02:03:37.370
<v Speaker 3>they get at four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2740
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:42.371
<v Speaker 3>even six babies and they fuck like crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they eat everything and then they </v>

2741
02:03:42.371 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 3>might be four or 500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they can get big kill one of them,</v>

2742
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:46.730
<v Speaker 3>one of those a year.</v>

2815
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:04.170
<v Speaker 3>but party is like they have to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if they don't do this then these</v>

2816
02:07:04.171 --> 02:07:05.850
<v Speaker 3>things keep breeding and there's more of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

2818
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 3>spreading across the entire country and </v>

<v Speaker 3>it looks.</v>

2823
02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

2824
02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I would want to do that with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>targets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>out there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

2827
02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:31.470
<v Speaker 3>You'd you'd want to do it with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is like you see a mama and</v>

2828
02:07:31.471 --> 02:07:36.471
<v Speaker 3>her babies and I mean it's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is it's kind of fucked up because </v>

2829
02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of other ways to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

2830
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you got to locate them on </v>

2831
02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:46.260
<v Speaker 3>these enormous ranches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are you going to do?</v>

2832
02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:49.340
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have people go out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

2833
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:54.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting camps and slowly make their way </v>

2834
02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:56.821
<v Speaker 3>through the bushes or in that they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>might kill 250 of them in a month or </v>

2835
02:07:57.011 --> 02:08:00.670
<v Speaker 3>these guys get $250 an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The efficiency of this process.</v>

2836
02:08:00.671 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 3>This is extremely efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is an epidemic.</v>

2837
02:08:03.371 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Don't mean What they're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

2838
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 3>You seeiNg all these pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at the populations that </v>

2839
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:14.431
<v Speaker 3>these guys are gunning down and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a fraction of what exists is the </v>

2840
02:08:14.431 --> 02:08:14.431
<v Speaker 3>shot right there.</v>

2841
02:08:14.431 --> 02:08:16.150
<v Speaker 3>That was like right out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>godfather,</v>

2842
02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.000
<v Speaker 3>the pig hanging from a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The helicopter.</v>

2843
02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh me,</v>

2844
02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:24.870
<v Speaker 3>that freeze frame on ted nugent's face </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an extra creepy coming.</v>

2845
02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Wait on a real show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2846
02:08:30.101 --> 02:08:32.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a goof.</v>

2847
02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real real.</v>

2848
02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poor calypso pork lips.</v>

2849
02:08:37.391 --> 02:08:42.391
<v Speaker 3>His episodes on pigmenTs show by so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see as a peRson who loves </v>

2850
02:08:44.141 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 3>animals and he also eats meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand conflict.</v>

2851
02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.220
<v Speaker 3>You know I love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love wild animals.</v>

2852
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.840
<v Speaker 3>I love pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love them,</v>

2853
02:08:52.841 --> 02:08:57.841
<v Speaker 3>but I also eat meat and they do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird relationship going on </v>

2854
02:08:57.841 --> 02:09:00.490
<v Speaker 3>with people and animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that to me in modern world is one of</v>

2855
02:09:00.491 --> 02:09:05.491
<v Speaker 3>the weirder aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flying around a helicopter gunning down </v>

2856
02:09:05.491 --> 02:09:10.230
<v Speaker 3>feral pigs that destroy cop crops caused</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars in damage and are </v>

2857
02:09:10.230 --> 02:09:11.530
<v Speaker 3>spreading across the entire country.</v>

2858
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 3>What else do you do know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seems so unfair,</v>

2859
02:09:17.070 --> 02:09:18.460
<v Speaker 3>tara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent unfair,</v>

2860
02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:23.640
<v Speaker 3>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it unfair if you're jogging through </v>

2861
02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:23.640
<v Speaker 3>the woods and a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he you.</v>

2862
02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:27.090
<v Speaker 3>is that unfair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems unfair to probably also </v>

2863
02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:27.090
<v Speaker 3>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2864
02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:29.941
<v Speaker 3>you barely levels of unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely able to just sustain a nice pace </v>

2865
02:09:29.941 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>and go jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If yOu've got to rustle up there,</v>

2866
02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:33.020
<v Speaker 3>just trying to drop a few lbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sit man,</v>

2867
02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to get eaten this grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking nowhere.</v>

2868
02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to.</v>

2869
02:09:37.371 --> 02:09:39.010
<v Speaker 3>We have weirD relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2870
02:09:39.011 --> 02:09:40.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you eat meat.</v>

2871
02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I don't feel too guilty about </v>

2872
02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.351
<v Speaker 3>it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat meat from the grocery store </v>

2873
02:09:49.351 --> 02:09:49.351
<v Speaker 3>and I don't feel too guilty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to say.</v>

2874
02:09:49.351 --> 02:09:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2875
02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.450
<v Speaker 3>that's fuckIng life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

2876
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:56.110
<v Speaker 3>do you feel bad about factory farming?</v>

2877
02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I try to buy good quality meat from good</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality places and.</v>

2878
02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:03.760
<v Speaker 3>But that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's about,</v>

2879
02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like farm raised fish and you know,</v>

2880
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try and buy good shit if I can.</v>

2881
02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I prefer to eat high quality things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2882
02:10:14.050 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She talked about cars more.</v>

2883
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we want to.</v>

2884
02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2885
02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:20.500
<v Speaker 3>What else is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else are you seeing?</v>

2886
02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.130
<v Speaker 3>And if we just had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got.</v>

2887
02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 3>We stumbled into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an area of dead animals and this is your</v>

2888
02:10:26.441 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what,</v>

2889
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:29.620
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to bring it there,</v>

2890
02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is when I get to talk to you.</v>

2891
02:10:31.211 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>So what are you going to do a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it happens.</v>

2892
02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what I'm interested in,</v>

2893
02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in that new corvette.</v>

2894
02:10:38.211 --> 02:10:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Zr one going to drive it next week on </v>
<v Speaker 2>monday and tuesday at road atlanta.</v>

2895
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>That thing looks ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven hundred and 50 horsepower.</v>

2896
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.980
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

2897
02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:51.340
<v Speaker 2>When are they going to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think thousand horsepower and a in a </v>

2898
02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:52.760
<v Speaker 2>regular car that people can buy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

2899
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2900
02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably do it first actually.</v>

2901
02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like a quote,</v>

2902
02:10:57.621 --> 02:11:02.240
<v Speaker 2>regular car with a thousand horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>would probably be electric,</v>

2903
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>like an electric car because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to make that power,</v>

2904
02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:06.620
<v Speaker 2>to look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's aggressive.</v>

2905
02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's aggressive.</v>

2906
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And you see they had to put this </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>

2907
02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:13.670
<v Speaker 2>a power bulge in the hood there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Center.</v>

2908
02:11:14.050 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2909
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this corvette zero six was out before </v>

2910
02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:20.440
<v Speaker 2>and it was very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>650 horsepower,</v>

2911
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:25.630
<v Speaker 2>but it had this issue where it was heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>soaking a wherein like it was you lose </v>

2912
02:11:25.731 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 2>power because the supercharger would </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop so much heat,</v>

2913
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:34.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a small supercharger to fit </v>

2914
02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.261
<v Speaker 2>under the low hood because every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the low hood is sort of a thing for </v>

2915
02:11:38.261 --> 02:11:42.521
<v Speaker 2>corvette and the way to make more power </v>
<v Speaker 2>while also creating less heat is to use </v>

2916
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:48.641
<v Speaker 2>a bigger supercharger and spin it slower</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to a smaller one that spun </v>

2917
02:11:48.981 --> 02:11:49.580
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

2918
02:11:50.090 --> 02:11:52.490
<v Speaker 2>So they had to put a bigger one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also,</v>

2919
02:11:52.491 --> 02:11:54.750
<v Speaker 2>which raises the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you fuck with,</v>

2920
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't know yet a even drIven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to say your,</v>

2921
02:11:57.590 --> 02:11:59.000
<v Speaker 2>your vantage point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your viewpoint.</v>

2922
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2923
02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll report back you put that couple of </v>

2924
02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:05.040
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's definitely a big,</v>

2925
02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:08.180
<v Speaker 2>a big old cow hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have driven,</v>

2926
02:12:08.190 --> 02:12:10.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a company called callaway.</v>

2927
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.140
<v Speaker 2>You've heard of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2928
02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:16.760
<v Speaker 2>They modify the wing back to that image </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just had.</v>

2929
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:22.390
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aero package is certainly </v>

2930
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.390
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

2931
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a beast.</v>

2932
02:12:22.641 --> 02:12:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks so good.</v>

2933
02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:26.270
<v Speaker 2>So I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have driven,</v>

2934
02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:31.460
<v Speaker 2>have a corvette of this generation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has an engine like this and I can see </v>

2935
02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:35.600
<v Speaker 2>that drove something called the callaway</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrow wagon.</v>

2936
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:39.320
<v Speaker 2>They actually turned a corvette into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a shooting brake,</v>

2937
02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.100
<v Speaker 2>like a wagon.</v>

2938
02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that bad.</v>

2939
02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:45.500
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it had 775 horsepower and it was one</v>

2940
02:12:45.501 --> 02:12:47.900
<v Speaker 2>of the scariest cars I've ever driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>that side profile,</v>

2941
02:12:47.901 --> 02:12:49.580
<v Speaker 2>that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get it as a convertible.</v>

2942
02:12:49.610 --> 02:12:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2943
02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Zero one is a convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do anything to extra.</v>

2944
02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Stiffen it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually,</v>

2945
02:12:55.431 --> 02:13:00.431
<v Speaker 2>the reason they do this is they say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof itself is not a contributor </v>

2946
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:06.010
<v Speaker 2>towards the chassis rigidity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can sell the car as a coupe or </v>

2947
02:13:06.010 --> 02:13:07.190
<v Speaker 2>convertible without any loss of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigidity.</v>

2948
02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:11.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what they say thing drives like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

2949
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a douche if you buy a car</v>
<v Speaker 2>one convertible.</v>

2950
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

2951
02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Because you're just thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>binding by the coop and take the roof </v>

2952
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.201
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can buy the coop and take the hard </v>

2953
02:13:23.201 --> 02:13:23.201
<v Speaker 2>roof rafters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same.</v>

2954
02:13:23.201 --> 02:13:24.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is because you don't like a douche.</v>

2955
02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Convertibles for douchebags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fa,</v>

2956
02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:32.010

<v Speaker 2>package</v>

2957
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 1>with an aero kit in a convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that picture of the red </v>

2958
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:37.350
<v Speaker 1>convertible again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>

2959

<v Speaker 1>Can you break down what's your verdict?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Convertible,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in a convertible and the convertible is </v>

2971
02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:11.970
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

2972
02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>A guy and a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>

2973
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So in the convertible is still weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still weird for you in 2018.</v>

2974
02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Well not there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any convertible to guys in any </v>

2975
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.300
<v Speaker 1>convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2976
02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So what do you losers doing?</v>

2977
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Real men don't put the top down by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2978
02:14:31.831 --> 02:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell somebody.</v>

2979
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm just driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2980
02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you can tell someone's a real bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver.</v>

2981
02:14:37.710 --> 02:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a really surefire way to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's a terrible driver.</v>

2982
02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:44.760
<v Speaker 1>If they've got a convertible and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a and they put the windows down,</v>

2983
02:14:44.761 --> 02:14:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but the front windows go down in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little back.</v>

2984
02:14:46.681 --> 02:14:51.681
<v Speaker 1>Windows stay up lIke a three series bmw </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they don't notice those little </v>

2985
02:14:51.681 --> 02:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>rear windows are just still up by </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2986
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.740
<v Speaker 1>That's how you can tell someone's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver.</v>

2987
02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Never checks their blind spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2988
02:14:57.211 --> 02:15:02.211
<v Speaker 1>even when you drive it in a convertible </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the windows up like stop for is </v>

2989
02:15:02.211 --> 02:15:02.211
<v Speaker 1>even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two guys in the back too.</v>

2990
02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in venice.</v>

2991
02:15:05.041 --> 02:15:10.041
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see all the convertible mustangs </v>

2992
02:15:10.041 --> 02:15:10.041
<v Speaker 1>loaded up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see that,</v>

2993
02:15:10.041 --> 02:15:14.421
<v Speaker 1>I always look at those four guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those guys dead weight </v>

2994
02:15:14.421 --> 02:15:14.421
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed.</v>

2995
02:15:14.421 --> 02:15:15.490
<v Speaker 1>One of those guys that paIn in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three of them hating the other.</v>

2996
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those guys always short on how </v>

2997
02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:20.910
<v Speaker 1>much he puts in for the tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

2998
02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:25.940
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you never pay every two weeks when </v>

2999
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay man.</v>

3000
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks so good though.</v>

3001
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Pull that picture up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

3002
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.290
<v Speaker 1>That looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red with black that,</v>

3003
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that [inaudible] convertible debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing dude.</v>

3004
02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:46.761
<v Speaker 1>And it's apparently faster around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia international raceway than the </v>

3005
02:15:46.761 --> 02:15:50.361
<v Speaker 1>ford gt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we just looked at and the ford gt </v>

3006
02:15:50.361 --> 02:15:50.361
<v Speaker 1>is like a race car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race car.</v>

3007
02:15:50.361 --> 02:15:52.680
<v Speaker 1>this thing as like a big trunk and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3008
02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

3009
02:15:54.901 --> 02:15:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty normal car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3010
02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I like how it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3011
02:15:58.050 --> 02:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of sacrifice going on </v>

3012
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>with driving one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3013
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get in it,</v>

3014
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you drive it and it's got a big trunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and freezing them comfortable and easy </v>

3015
02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:12.231
<v Speaker 1>to live with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But It's interesting that this is like </v>

3016
02:16:12.231 --> 02:16:12.231
<v Speaker 1>this game of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3017
02:16:12.231 --> 02:16:16.911
<v Speaker 1>let's look at watches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real improvement in </v>

3018
02:16:16.911 --> 02:16:16.911
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3019
02:16:16.911 --> 02:16:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're beautiful and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the performance difference </v>

3020
02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:21.270
<v Speaker 1>between now and 10 years ago is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

3021
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a mechanical watch to know.</v>

3022
02:16:24.331 --> 02:16:29.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's artistry and there's </v>

3023
02:16:29.331 --> 02:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>technological complication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3024
02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:33.930
<v Speaker 2>there's complication for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 2>complications.</v>

3025
02:16:33.931 --> 02:16:37.780
<v Speaker 2>So they'll have watches like to use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car example,</v>

3026
02:16:38.650 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>imagine a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3027
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And from the outside it looks roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a normal car,</v>

3028
02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:45.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For four wheels,</v>

3029
02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 2>don't the driver's seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3030
02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:52.660
<v Speaker 2>It has one engine and it has for </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmissions coming off of that engine,</v>

3031
02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:57.220
<v Speaker 2>all of which come back together to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it the car.</v>

3032
02:16:57.310 --> 02:17:01.480
<v Speaker 2>One wheel drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] right.</v>

3033
02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that applied to a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'll be like one main movement that </v>

3034
02:17:07.541 --> 02:17:12.541
<v Speaker 2>goes out into four gear trains and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back into just an hour and a </v>

3035
02:17:12.731 --> 02:17:17.731
<v Speaker 2>minute hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why would you sync up for gear </v>

3036
02:17:17.731 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 2>trains when you could do the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one?</v>

3037
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3038
02:17:19.271 --> 02:17:22.060
<v Speaker 2>because we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be like building a car with two</v>

3039
02:17:22.061 --> 02:17:24.040
<v Speaker 2>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not smart,</v>

3040
02:17:24.370 --> 02:17:29.370
<v Speaker 2>but you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be like god built the fucking car </v>

3041
02:17:29.370 --> 02:17:29.370
<v Speaker 2>with two engine less.</v>

3042
02:17:29.370 --> 02:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about like the nsx </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine,</v>

3043
02:17:29.801 --> 02:17:32.470
<v Speaker 2>we have the front engine electric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

3044
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:37.471
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what I'm getting at is that </v>

3045
02:17:37.471 --> 02:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>with computers and with cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the one thing that you expect </v>

3046
02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and improvement every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3047
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 2>just that nobody's going to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 2>old way.</v>

3048
02:17:44.310 --> 02:17:47.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't just build unless your singer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make something custom.</v>

3049
02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Well that's that the singer is what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>example was,</v>

3050
02:17:51.791 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 2>what the mechanical watch kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry is,</v>

3051
02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3052
02:17:57.061 --> 02:18:02.061
<v Speaker 2>they position it as a luxury item from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time gone by sort of thing,</v>

3053
02:18:02.801 --> 02:18:07.801
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas actually if you want to talk </v>

3054
02:18:07.801 --> 02:18:09.391
<v Speaker 2>about innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this right here is a grand seiko which </v>

3055
02:18:09.391 --> 02:18:10.840
<v Speaker 2>has a movement called a spring drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement in it.</v>

3056
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:16.170
<v Speaker 2>And it is one of the most advanced and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique mechanical movements available in</v>

3057
02:18:16.571 --> 02:18:18.370
<v Speaker 2>a watch today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a seiko.</v>

3058
02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a grand seiko,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

3059
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.060
<v Speaker 2>So the difference is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3060
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:24.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about a lexis.</v>

3061
02:18:24.670 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Think about alexis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A seiko is a lexus,</v>

3062
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:30.850
<v Speaker 2>not a toyota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a lexus.</v>

3063
02:18:30.851 --> 02:18:35.851
<v Speaker 2>Lfa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grand seiko is built in a different </v>

3064
02:18:35.851 --> 02:18:38.560
<v Speaker 2>factory from the regular seikos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built by hand,</v>

3065
02:18:38.561 --> 02:18:40.780
<v Speaker 2>completely by hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hand finished,</v>

3066
02:18:40.781 --> 02:18:44.380
<v Speaker 2>hand polished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built of exotic materials.</v>

3067
02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:47.570
<v Speaker 2>It has a cool movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you should sell watches,</v>

3068
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:49.150
<v Speaker 2>watch podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching,</v>

3069
02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:50.860
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on youtube,</v>

3070
02:18:51.670 --> 02:18:54.400
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have what is called the display</v>

3071
02:18:54.401 --> 02:18:57.820
<v Speaker 2>back on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the movement in the back and</v>

3072
02:18:57.821 --> 02:19:02.821
<v Speaker 2>how high the level of finishes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got sapphire and titanium and um,</v>

3073
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 2>so the spring drive movement is without </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting crazy,</v>

3074
02:19:08.381 --> 02:19:09.640
<v Speaker 2>crazy nerdy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

3075
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 2>is actually a true innovation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical watchmaking.</v>

3076
02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>So run the chronograph is on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The top button not here to watch the </v>

3077
02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 2>sweep of the coronagraph hand.</v>

3078
02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:23.980
<v Speaker 2>The big secondhand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a perfectly smooth sweep.</v>

3079
02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.530
<v Speaker 2>The smoothest possible sweep that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

3080
02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 2>It is smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

3081
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3082
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:33.460
<v Speaker 2>How much is the website?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This worth around?</v>

3083
02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:35.690
<v Speaker 2>10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3084

02:20:24.441 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Our complicaTion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>

3105
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:31.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a basically just the black face </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost looks like a bathroom scale and </v>

<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>

3213
02:25:39.691 --> 02:25:39.691
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3214
02:25:39.691 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 2>That that's a million dollars and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see someone wearing one in person,</v>

3215
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 2>it's big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3216
02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the size of that back.</v>

3217
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Any lid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coffee mug and your hands.</v>

3218
02:25:51.370 --> 02:25:55.840
<v Speaker 2>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually.</v>

3219
02:25:55.841 --> 02:26:00.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'd be shocked at what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing with certain with machinery </v>

3220
02:26:01.481 --> 02:26:03.790
<v Speaker 2>and wanton mechanical watchmaker would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be received.</v>

3221
02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:06.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fight against friction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>

3222
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:11.551
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this tiny little spring and </v>

3223
02:26:11.551 --> 02:26:11.551
<v Speaker 2>you need to get as much power out of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

3224
02:26:11.551 --> 02:26:16.111
<v Speaker 2>So they engineered these like micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>grams of friction out of this stuff.</v>

3225
02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:21.301
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are work star trek and a whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3227
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:29.670

<v Speaker 2>It looks like a star trek communicator </v>

3228
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:34.020
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does something like that go </v>

3229
02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:34.020
<v Speaker 2>for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably 50 or 60.</v>

02:26:34.210 --> 02:26:39.210

02:27:27.431 --> 02:27:32.431
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called h y t that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes watches that have a liquid </v>

3256

<v Speaker 2>the green liquid goes around the dial.</v>

3263
02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like a nuclear ooze that like flows</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the dial.</v>

3264
02:27:59.510 --> 02:28:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that goo,</v>

3268
02:28:05.441 --> 02:28:10.441
<v Speaker 2>like it flows.</v>

3269
02:28:10.441 --> 02:28:13.210
<v Speaker 2>on the top left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fills up around the dial.</v>

3270
02:28:13.211 --> 02:28:15.850
<v Speaker 2>And then is when it goes all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

3271
02:28:15.851 --> 02:28:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Is it a minute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ain't no,</v>

3272
02:28:17.501 --> 02:28:20.150
<v Speaker 2>it's an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

3273
02:28:20.151 --> 02:28:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>it is in the outline and then it had,</v>

3275
02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:26.550
<v Speaker 2>it had a typical hour hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3276
02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And then this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it flows around the skull to food.</v>

3277
02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:32.900
<v Speaker 2>You actually have something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost 100 grand or something.</v>

3278
02:28:33.370 --> 02:28:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Actual rose is actually sponsored by </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3279
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So when you say sponsored,</v>

3282
02:28:41.181 --> 02:28:44.110
<v Speaker 2>like what do they do to get axle to </v>

<v Speaker 3>watches,</v>

3460
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:27.970
<v Speaker 3>like when you think about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>small like jewelry and watches,</v>

3461
02:36:27.971 --> 02:36:32.971
<v Speaker 3>something that's this little on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you fit in your hand can be </v>

3462
02:36:32.971 --> 02:36:34.210
<v Speaker 3>worth a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only things in life where something</v>

3463
02:36:34.211 --> 02:36:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that fits in your hand is worth a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars.</v>

3464
02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also a lot of the mainstream</v>

3465
02:36:39.610 --> 02:36:43.210
<v Speaker 3>brands like rolex and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of um,</v>

3466
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:47.680
<v Speaker 3>a false prop up of the value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They intentionally,</v>

3467
02:36:47.681 --> 02:36:52.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't build as many submariners as </v>

3468
02:36:52.681 --> 02:36:53.500
<v Speaker 3>they could because they want to drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>the market up demand up and it keeps the</v>

3469
02:36:53.501 --> 02:36:57.310
<v Speaker 3>used values high and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an entire ecosystem,</v>

3470
02:36:57.430 --> 02:37:02.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on new and used watch values and </v>

3471
02:37:02.430 --> 02:37:03.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think the craziest value thing in</v>

3472
02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:08.490
<v Speaker 3>anything of like high end things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people love is diamonds because they're </v>

3473
02:37:08.490 --> 02:37:09.040
<v Speaker 3>not even really that rare anymore.</v>

3474
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read you can make them in the </v>

3475
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>microwave now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a thing.</v>

3476
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read an article,</v>

3477
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.190
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to make diamonds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

3478
02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:20.460
<v Speaker 3>how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same way they can make them in a </v>

3479
02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:21.080
<v Speaker 3>lap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone figured out a process carbon and</v>

3480
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:22.040
<v Speaker 3>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3481
02:37:22.041 --> 02:37:24.140
<v Speaker 3>when they make them in a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>

3482
02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they can make really big </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones in a lab yet.</v>

3483
02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I think they're gonna only make like one</v>
<v Speaker 3>or two carrots.</v>

3484
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely be down with getting </v>

3485
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>cremated and being turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond.</v>

3486
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists figured out a way to make </v>

3487
02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:40.020
<v Speaker 3>diamonds and a microphone and it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the diamond industry.</v>

3488
02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over bitches.</v>

3489
02:37:41.541 --> 02:37:43.400
<v Speaker 3>April ninth just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

3490
02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I read this article and I just noticed </v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's business insider.</v>

3491
02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3492
02:37:48.350 --> 02:37:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Placing a tiny fragment of a diamond,</v>

3493
02:37:50.841 --> 02:37:54.830
<v Speaker 3>a carbon seat in the microwave with </v>
<v Speaker 3>varying amounts of carbon heavy gas.</v>

3494
02:37:55.070 --> 02:38:00.070
<v Speaker 3>The result is a synthetic ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond with the exact same structure </v>

3495
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:04.451
<v Speaker 3>and chemical compositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That diamond that came from the ground </v>

3496
02:38:04.451 --> 02:38:05.210
<v Speaker 3>works so weLl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Experts reportedly need machines to tell</v>

3497
02:38:05.211 --> 02:38:10.211
<v Speaker 3>the lab grown gems apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural ones estimated by 2026.</v>

3498
02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.660
<v Speaker 3>The number of lab made diamonds will </v>
<v Speaker 3>skyrocket to 20 million carats.</v>

3499
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:17.900
<v Speaker 3>So then here's the thinG,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who owns a naTuRal diamond,</v>

3500
02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:21.510

<v Speaker 3>think so will be like,</v>

3501
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:22.850
<v Speaker 3>this is natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shit came from.</v>

3502
02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:24.380
<v Speaker 3>What if they can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

3503
02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.040
<v Speaker 3>You go to a machine like this,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so it's not.</v>

3576
02:41:33.601 --> 02:41:35.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a question of whether he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it right,</v>

3577
02:41:36.210 --> 02:41:38.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's a matter of whether or not it's</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's been told yes a thousand times a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day floods.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think it's not going to.</v>

3602
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see how he can make it </v>

3603
02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:38.830
<v Speaker 3>through for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3604
02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:39.330
<v Speaker 3>It's only thing one year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3605
02:42:39.550 --> 02:42:42.720
<v Speaker 3>it's very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very bad.</v>

3606
02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:47.750
<v Speaker 3>While we've been going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Ryan has announced that he's going </v>

3607
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.750
<v Speaker 3>to not seek reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3608
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:49.530
<v Speaker 3>thank god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul.</v>

3609
02:42:49.531 --> 02:42:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Ryan's probably sees the writing on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

3610
02:42:51.450 --> 02:42:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that guy do?</v>

3611
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:55.470
<v Speaker 3>And apparently he had some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic challenger,</v>

3612
02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:00.560
<v Speaker 3>a democrat that has been really ramping </v>
<v Speaker 3>up their campaign and he does not want </v>

3613
02:43:00.751 --> 02:43:03.090
<v Speaker 3>to stick around to see how that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

3614
02:43:03.150 --> 02:43:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Really does want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't want to get humiliated,</v>

3615
02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:07.230
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3616
02:43:07.231 --> 02:43:08.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think?</v>

3617
02:43:08.071 --> 02:43:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe he's just tired of losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>

3618
02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Maybe needs to get paid for all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bribes.</v>

3619
02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Like now it's time saw today that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the former speaker,</v>

3620
02:43:16.991 --> 02:43:20.290
<v Speaker 3>john banner is now on the board of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>major,</v>

3621
02:43:20.350 --> 02:43:24.260
<v Speaker 3>major marijuana legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3622
02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Got to get that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about this legalization </v>

3623
02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:29.440
<v Speaker 3>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haTe it.</v>

3624
02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:30.340
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should lock people up,</v>

3625
02:43:31.130 --> 02:43:33.310
<v Speaker 3>lock them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gettiNg high lock them up,</v>

3626
02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:38.200
<v Speaker 3>but compared to prop 2:15</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to jet Seventeen to 18,</v>

3627
02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:41.500
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3628
02:43:41.501 --> 02:43:44.140
<v Speaker 3>the 30 percent sales taX,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was inevitable,</v>

3629
02:43:44.141 --> 02:43:47.200
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I like about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still reasonable.</v>

3630
02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:51.160
<v Speaker 3>You can get high on a very small amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of money for a long period of time.</v>

3631
02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should be complaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that too.</v>

3632
02:43:53.771 --> 02:43:58.771
<v Speaker 3>I think we could show that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real benefit to legalization that </v>

3633
02:43:58.771 --> 02:43:58.771
<v Speaker 3>benefits communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit schools,</v>

3634
02:43:58.771 --> 02:44:00.010
<v Speaker 3>firemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police officers,</v>

3635
02:44:00.011 --> 02:44:02.320
<v Speaker 3>whoever can get that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where the money should be</v>

3636
02:44:02.321 --> 02:44:07.321
<v Speaker 3>allocated and I think you could get </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars for the state just </v>

3637
02:44:07.321 --> 02:44:09.310
<v Speaker 3>doing that and I think that is a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive aspect of legalization.</v>

3638
02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:14.310
<v Speaker 3>That might be the one thing that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the straw that breaks the camel's </v>

3639
02:44:14.310 --> 02:44:17.281
<v Speaker 3>back across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people realize that you can make </v>

3640
02:44:17.281 --> 02:44:19.831
<v Speaker 3>real money and that real money could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial to things that communities </v>

3641
02:44:19.831 --> 02:44:21.310
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus you starve out illegal drug selling</v>

3642
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:26.520
<v Speaker 3>illegal drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sellings with the real problem has </v>

3643
02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:26.520
<v Speaker 3>always been when you make something </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>

3644
02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:28.000
<v Speaker 3>only criminals are going to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have criminal mentality.</v>

3645
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:33.150
<v Speaker 3>You have people that have guns and gangs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those are the people that were </v>

3646
02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:33.370
<v Speaker 3>scared of not businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3647
02:44:33.371 --> 02:44:35.740
<v Speaker 3>If we were scared of businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be trying to close liquor stores.</v>

3648
02:44:35.741 --> 02:44:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a shit about wineries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know we're not.</v>

3649
02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Those are drugstores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a winery,</v>

3650
02:44:39.911 --> 02:44:44.911
<v Speaker 3>is a drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they liStened to you talking about </v>

3651
02:44:44.911 --> 02:44:48.660
<v Speaker 3>about wine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just sell delicious trucks and for </v>

3652
02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love wine.</v>

3653
02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:49.870
<v Speaker 3>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is selling.</v>

3654
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:54.910
<v Speaker 3>One thing should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things should be legal and when </v>

3655
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:57.721
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax the fucking shit out of it and give </v>

3656
02:44:57.721 --> 02:44:57.730
<v Speaker 3>that money back to the community and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody benefits.</v>

3657
02:44:57.850 --> 02:45:01.030
<v Speaker 3>People like you and I who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible grown adults,</v>

3658
02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:06.180
<v Speaker 3>prepare taxes and are good people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd like to get high occasionally that </v>

3659
02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:10.230
<v Speaker 3>we should be able to buy it with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about being locked in a fucking </v>

3660
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.990
<v Speaker 3>cage and that money should go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

3661
02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:15.991
<v Speaker 3>That money should go to fix the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That money should go to cops and </v>

3662
02:45:15.991 --> 02:45:18.631
<v Speaker 3>firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it should go do it that </v>

3663
02:45:18.631 --> 02:45:18.631
<v Speaker 3>makes that we know where it's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>allocated.</v>

3664
02:45:18.631 --> 02:45:19.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

3665
02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:20.410
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would hope it's.</v>

3666
02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:26.280
<v Speaker 3>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm joining the board of anchorage </v>

3667
02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:26.280
<v Speaker 3>holdings holdings acreage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

3668
02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.910
<v Speaker 3>because my thinking on cannabis has </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved.</v>

3669
02:45:28.010 --> 02:45:33.010
<v Speaker 3>That's my man got high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was anti and then I got some of his </v>

3670
02:45:33.410 --> 02:45:36.970
<v Speaker 3>good shit right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced dea scheduling the drug is</v>

3671
02:45:36.971 --> 02:45:41.971
<v Speaker 3>needed so that we could do research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help our veterans and reverse the opiod </v>

3672
02:45:41.971 --> 02:45:44.680
<v Speaker 3>epidemic ravaging our communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3673
02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I agree man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would add to that.</v>

3674
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Get high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say so we can get hot.</v>

3675
02:45:49.630 --> 02:45:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Put everyone out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there.</v>

3676
02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Is there evidence showing a weed reduces</v>
<v Speaker 3>opioid use?</v>

3677
02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:55.360
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3678
02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it really depends upon how it's </v>

3679
02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:03.511
<v Speaker 3>used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can benefit some people with some </v>

3680
02:46:03.511 --> 02:46:04.330
<v Speaker 3>kind of paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T think it's realistic to say that</v>

3681
02:46:04.331 --> 02:46:09.331
<v Speaker 3>some people that are in horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible pain would get the same </v>

3682
02:46:09.331 --> 02:46:10.640
<v Speaker 3>reaction for marijuana to get for </v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>

3683
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:13.340
<v Speaker 3>People with really bad burns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

3684
02:46:13.341 --> 02:46:17.390
<v Speaker 3>were there 24 slash seven addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for medical reasons.</v>

3685
02:46:17.391 --> 02:46:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about if you're become </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to,</v>

3686
02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:21.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3687
02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:23.180
<v Speaker 3>oxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's better drugs,</v>

3688
02:46:23.370 --> 02:46:24.650
<v Speaker 3>there's better drugs that get you off.</v>

3689
02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a few that can help you.</v>

3690
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Probably the most powerful in the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient is a ibogaine because no one </v>

3691
02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:34.950
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3692
02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:35.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3693
02:46:35.271 --> 02:46:40.271
<v Speaker 3>I began as non iowasca I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a hallucinogenic that is from </v>

3694
02:46:40.271 --> 02:46:44.740
<v Speaker 3>south America is dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibogaine is from the boga tree and it's </v>

3695
02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:48.490
<v Speaker 3>a from breaking open the head that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a book called breaking.</v>

3696
02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ibogaine is like a roof and it's </v>

3697
02:46:54.490 --> 02:46:56.150
<v Speaker 3>something I haven't experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking out of what I've read.</v>

3698
02:46:56.510 --> 02:47:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Essentially a ruthlessly introspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>24 hour trip that rewires the way your </v>

3699
02:47:03.141 --> 02:47:07.730
<v Speaker 3>brain views addiction and has a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of effectiveness.</v>

3700
02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Interesting in rehabilitating people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just killing the desire to do </v>

3701
02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:14.150
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they doing that in America?</v>

3702
02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to Mexico.</v>

3703
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:17.600
<v Speaker 3>Can't go to America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal in America.</v>

3704
02:47:17.601 --> 02:47:22.601
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like a sweat lodge sherman type </v>

3705
02:47:22.601 --> 02:47:22.601
<v Speaker 3>thing or is it a hospital?</v>

3706
02:47:22.601 --> 02:47:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Subsequent hospital type situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

3707
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:27.470
<v Speaker 3>My buddy ed clay runs a a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he still does,</v>

3708
02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:32.780
<v Speaker 3>runs a clinic down in Mexico and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>started it because of his experiences </v>

3709
02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:32.930
<v Speaker 3>with pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got hurt,</v>

3710
02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:35.690
<v Speaker 3>got on paIn pills and had a real hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>time with them.</v>

3711
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Went to get on ibogaine to get off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain pills.</v>

3712
02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:40.700
<v Speaker 3>It worked like a charm and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

3713
02:47:40.701 --> 02:47:45.701
<v Speaker 3>I need to let people know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get your life back and it's not </v>

3714
02:47:45.701 --> 02:47:47.270
<v Speaker 3>something you get addicted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's apparently something that hard time</v>

3715
02:47:47.271 --> 02:47:48.310
<v Speaker 3>doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3716
02:47:48.350 --> 02:47:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's rough.</v>

3717
02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you go,</v>

3718
02:47:50.651 --> 02:47:51.560
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was enough.</v>

3719
02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Like dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3720
02:47:53.781 --> 02:47:58.781
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those ones was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did it once in college and that was </v>

3721
02:47:58.781 --> 02:47:59.220
<v Speaker 3>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3722
02:47:59.221 --> 02:48:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you can get a lot out of one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3723
02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a plaid plaid fucking world flying</v>

3724
02:48:05.061 --> 02:48:05.420
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

3725
02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:07.820
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was full out of body nuts.</v>

3726
02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty nuts.</v>

3727
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the difference in ibogaine </v>

3728
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:16.601
<v Speaker 3>versus dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt is ego dissolving and very </v>

3729
02:48:16.601 --> 02:48:19.250
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenic and you see these amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>visualizations.</v>

3730
02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I began,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to not have that,</v>

3731
02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:25.940
<v Speaker 3>but instead be like deeply like to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cellular level,</v>

3732
02:48:25.970 --> 02:48:30.970
<v Speaker 3>introspective and just an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of a physical action </v>

3733
02:48:30.970 --> 02:48:35.801
<v Speaker 3>that happens in the way your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way your brain looks at addiction </v>

3734
02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:40.940
<v Speaker 3>changes pretty radically through it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just happens.</v>

3735
02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:46.000
<v Speaker 3>You should probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of those things should be </v>

3736
02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.311
<v Speaker 3>done in places where people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel safe and where people have done it </v>

3737
02:48:48.311 --> 02:48:51.170
<v Speaker 3>before and where people have experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people that have done it before and</v>

3738
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:54.890
<v Speaker 3>having a real center that has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3739
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:57.620
<v Speaker 3>real professionals and medical health </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff,</v>

3740
02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.840
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you want and the only thing </v>

3741
02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:05.441
<v Speaker 3>that's keeping that from happening in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and keeping millions and </v>

3742
02:49:05.441 --> 02:49:06.020
<v Speaker 3>millions of people from getting off </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>

3743
02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:08.340
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug companies,</v>

3744
02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:13.400
<v Speaker 3>drug companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lobbying to keep all these very helpful </v>

3745
02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:16.611
<v Speaker 3>things illegal and we're slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 3>surely going to work them out and the </v>

3746
02:49:16.611 --> 02:49:16.611
<v Speaker 3>way we're going to work the mouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>through money.</v>

3747
02:49:16.611 --> 02:49:19.440
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana has a 30 percent tax.</v>

3748
02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Make it 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

3749
02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:23.610
<v Speaker 3>What's a joint?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much does it joining?</v>

3750
02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:27.210
<v Speaker 3>A joint can get you high all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what a drink is.</v>

3751
02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to bar,</v>

3752
02:49:28.411 --> 02:49:29.820

<v Speaker 3>How much does a drink cost?</v>

3753
02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:34.020

<v Speaker 3>Half a day.</v>

02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:13.941
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden I want to buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal weed because the taxes and you </v>

3768
02:50:13.941 --> 02:50:14.800
<v Speaker 3>just talked me guilted me even back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal weed.</v>

3769
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to pay it and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

3770
02:50:17.170 --> 02:50:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3771
02:50:17.610 --> 02:50:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand you.</v>

3772
02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

3773
02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:24.210
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No you're not,</v>

3774
02:50:24.211 --> 02:50:27.000
<v Speaker 3>but some people would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying the money if it goes to a</v>

3775
02:50:27.001 --> 02:50:32.001
<v Speaker 3>good cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we really can change the way people </v>

3776
02:50:32.001 --> 02:50:32.730
<v Speaker 3>perceive drugs because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a war on drugs.</v>

3777
02:50:32.731 --> 02:50:37.731
<v Speaker 3>That is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's drugs everywhere they're </v>

3778
02:50:37.731 --> 02:50:37.920
<v Speaker 3>prescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get them into the drug store,</v>

3779
02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you can get them at a liquor store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get drugs.</v>

3780
02:50:40.531 --> 02:50:42.840
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just certain drugs,</v>

3781
02:50:43.170 --> 02:50:45.090
<v Speaker 3>the ones that they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3782
02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:46.680
<v Speaker 3>corporatize as easily.</v>

3783
02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.290
<v Speaker 3>So the way to get it in is not through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the corporations influence,</v>

3784
02:50:50.291 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 3>but through the influences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consumer of the consumer to consumer</v>

3785
02:50:53.851 --> 02:50:58.851
<v Speaker 3>paying exorbitant amount of taxes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things willingly is going to </v>

3786
02:50:58.851 --> 02:50:59.190
<v Speaker 3>change the opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3787
02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I like weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being legal.</v>

3788
02:51:00.570 --> 02:51:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay the fucking tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

3789
02:51:02.970 --> 02:51:04.290
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just curious.</v>

3790
02:51:04.291 --> 02:51:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look selfishly,</v>

3791
02:51:06.810 --> 02:51:11.810
<v Speaker 3>totally selfishly my own benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I as a guy who jumped through the hoops </v>

3792
02:51:13.201 --> 02:51:18.201
<v Speaker 3>and got a $40 medical card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was happy to have it be called medicine </v>

3793
02:51:18.570 --> 02:51:21.930
<v Speaker 3>and get it and have it legally and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay taxes on it.</v>

3794
02:51:22.290 --> 02:51:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Now it seems like it's the same except </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying the tax on it.</v>

3795
02:51:26.490 --> 02:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's progress because the money's </v>

3796
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.490
<v Speaker 3>going into community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope.</v>

3797
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I hope if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's find out where it goes.</v>

3798
02:51:32.530 --> 02:51:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Let's say a guest.</v>

3799
02:51:34.290 --> 02:51:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I hope it goes towards law enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's divvied up between law </v>

3800
02:51:39.631 --> 02:51:41.520
<v Speaker 3>enforcement and education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

3801
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's hope it goes to education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something tells me it's not.</v>

3802
02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:47.250
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like it's going to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much money.</v>

3803
02:51:47.251 --> 02:51:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Like Colorado had a gift tax money back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>

3804
02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they really have to get a refund back</v>

3805
02:51:52.561 --> 02:51:54.110
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much money being made</v>
<v Speaker 3>by wheat.</v>

3806
02:51:54.130 --> 02:51:56.160
<v Speaker 3>That's like Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the oil pipeline.</v>

3807
02:51:56.190 --> 02:51:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't vegetative state taxes,</v>

3808
02:51:59.490 --> 02:52:01.710
<v Speaker 3>boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they have negative state</v>

3809
02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:03.820
<v Speaker 3>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know they gave people refunds.</v>

3810
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 3>The gave people money because they made </v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

3811
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.870
<v Speaker 1>much money on taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3812
02:52:07.871 --> 02:52:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3813
02:52:09.341 --> 02:52:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And if that happens in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep my fucking 30 percent sales tax.</v>

3814
02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Real estate went up 14 percent since </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana was legalized.</v>

3815
02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people thought,</v>

3816
02:52:19.691 --> 02:52:23.390
<v Speaker 1>well they'll no to move out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's pothead.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cannabis club and there's only.</v>

<v Speaker 1>where you can do that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And also their revenue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by get.</v>

3881
02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

3882
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:07.430
<v Speaker 3>very easy for someone to rip your video </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of,</v>

3883
02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:12.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it somewhere else on facebook and </v>

3884
02:55:12.730 --> 02:55:14.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever versus if they re upload it </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else on youtube,</v>

3885
02:55:14.451 --> 02:55:16.640
<v Speaker 3>the software algorithm will generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>catch it.</v>

3886
02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3887
02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:22.720
<v Speaker 3>So the software algorithm and facebook </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not as effective and they don't </v>

3888
02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:22.720
<v Speaker 3>really give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>

3889
02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:26.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're too busy selling your </v>

3890
02:55:26.801 --> 02:55:26.801
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look in Russia.</v>

3891
02:55:26.801 --> 02:55:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie was watching the video of dr.</v>

3892
02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Soccer berg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did it go?</v>

3893
02:55:29.570 --> 02:55:31.000
<v Speaker 3>He should know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3894
02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:35.110
<v Speaker 4>he had to go again today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3895
02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:37.540
<v Speaker 4>I was watching right before you got here</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this.</v>

3896
02:55:37.810 --> 02:55:39.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where she was from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was saying like,</v>

3897
02:55:39.431 --> 02:55:42.280
<v Speaker 4>you're the ceo of this company and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should know some of these answers.</v>

3898
02:55:42.281 --> 02:55:43.580
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listing all the shitty.</v>

3899
02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>

3900
02:55:45.851 --> 02:55:47.620
<v Speaker 4>And then I afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they've shown,</v>

3901
02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:50.650
<v Speaker 4>which I guess it's part of now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public information has notes.</v>

3902
02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:55.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he had like as references that he </v>

3903
02:55:55.860 --> 02:55:55.860
<v Speaker 4>was looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only seen one picture of it.</v>

3904
02:55:55.860 --> 02:56:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Just very weird stuff that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems blatantly obvious that he should </v>

3905
02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:01.350
<v Speaker 4>know or should say that's different from</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we've.</v>

3906
02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we think we should think they </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be able to.</v>

3907
02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I get the impression that this company </v>
<v Speaker 3>grew so fast,</v>

3908
02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:09.960
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in now.</v>

3909
02:56:09.961 --> 02:56:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Will those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing he was talking about,</v>

3910
02:56:11.641 --> 02:56:14.490
<v Speaker 3>their influence on possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to continue?</v>

3911
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:15.950
<v Speaker 3>We'll continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

3912
02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:21.680
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about his influence on </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different upcoming elections </v>

3913
02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:25.521
<v Speaker 3>that were coming up and about how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to make sure that there was no </v>

3914
02:56:25.521 --> 02:56:27.240
<v Speaker 3>bots that were influencing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>elections and then I stopped and thought</v>

3915
02:56:27.241 --> 02:56:28.590
<v Speaker 3>about it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>

3916
02:56:28.770 --> 02:56:32.610
<v Speaker 3>In that moment of him saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized like what pressure he must be</v>

3917
02:56:32.611 --> 02:56:37.611
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what pressure that company is under </v>

3918
02:56:37.611 --> 02:56:39.351
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went from being a thing where </v>

3919
02:56:39.351 --> 02:56:39.351
<v Speaker 3>people could share pictures like of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3920
02:56:39.351 --> 02:56:40.710
<v Speaker 3>this is us on our summer vacation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3921
02:56:40.711 --> 02:56:41.360
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3922
02:56:41.370 --> 02:56:43.590
<v Speaker 3>fucking we're going to go to the pub on </v>
<v Speaker 3>friday.</v>

3923
02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:45.690
<v Speaker 3>That's what facebook kind of was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3924
02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:48.420
<v Speaker 3>People would talk about certain things </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the news.</v>

3925
02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:50.120
<v Speaker 3>They would have opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put up something,</v>

3926
02:56:50.130 --> 02:56:52.530
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people comment on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

3927
02:56:53.610 --> 02:56:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Now with this last election and with him</v>
<v Speaker 3>testifying in front of congress,</v>

3928
02:56:59.550 --> 02:57:04.550
<v Speaker 3>what I'm seeing is facebook being like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important sources of </v>

3929
02:57:05.250 --> 02:57:10.250
<v Speaker 3>influence in the world today and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really being completely managed out.</v>

3930
02:57:15.410 --> 02:57:17.560
<v Speaker 4>I still feel like the russians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the russians.</v>

3931
02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's a little bit like google </v>

3932
02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:22.780
<v Speaker 4>needs to be looked into going on with my</v>
<v Speaker 4>mic.</v>

3933
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:25.420
<v Speaker 4>So google also probably like they have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>data,</v>

3934
02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I think someone was just looking into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3935
02:57:27.551 --> 02:57:29.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people downloaded their facebook profile</v>

3936
02:57:29.601 --> 02:57:31.510
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my files one gigabyte.</v>

3937
02:57:31.511 --> 02:57:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much data is in here?</v>

3938
02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:35.670
<v Speaker 4>People found out a way to download </v>
<v Speaker 4>theirs and find their information.</v>

3939
02:57:35.671 --> 02:57:37.240
<v Speaker 4>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does facebook know about me?</v>

3940
02:57:37.690 --> 02:57:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there's also one that google </v>
<v Speaker 4>has on everyone and it's much larger</v>

3941
02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:46.740
<v Speaker 3>to the music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shocked,</v>

3942
02:57:49.090 --> 02:57:50.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be,</v>

3943
02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:53.710
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be nervous if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3944
02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:57.310
<v Speaker 3>That memo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3945
02:57:57.311 --> 02:57:59.590
<v Speaker 3>really changed my mind about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3946
02:57:59.591 --> 02:58:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Not because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3947
02:58:02.281 --> 02:58:04.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a subject that's near and dear to </v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart,</v>

3948
02:58:04.981 --> 02:58:07.670
<v Speaker 3>but because the way they were handling </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not,</v>

3949
02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:10.230
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't being honest.</v>

3950
02:58:10.290 --> 02:58:15.290
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't being honest about the </v>

3951
02:58:15.290 --> 02:58:16.461
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't being honest about the </v>

3952
02:58:16.461 --> 02:58:17.961
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even the way they were </v>

3953
02:58:17.961 --> 02:58:19.851
<v Speaker 3>describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the james damore </v>

3954
02:58:19.851 --> 02:58:19.851
<v Speaker 3>google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3955
02:58:19.851 --> 02:58:19.851
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3956
02:58:19.851 --> 02:58:24.310
<v Speaker 3>it was at the seXism thing was that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the the what he was talking about women </v>

3957
02:58:24.310 --> 02:58:29.301
<v Speaker 3>in tech explain why women would prefer </v>
<v Speaker 3>to not like why some women are not </v>

3958
02:58:29.701 --> 02:58:32.760
<v Speaker 3>influenced by the way google handled it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very,</v>

3959
02:58:33.350 --> 02:58:36.090
<v Speaker 3>very nervous because they weren't being </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest about the information.</v>

3960
02:58:36.270 --> 02:58:41.270
<v Speaker 3>They weren't beIng honest about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>results that weren't being honest about </v>

3961
02:58:41.270 --> 02:58:43.641
<v Speaker 3>what was in his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying he was reinforcing </v>

3962
02:58:43.641 --> 02:58:44.280
<v Speaker 3>harmful gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what he was doing.</v>

3963
02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:49.570
<v Speaker 3>What he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science of the difference in the </v>

3964
02:58:49.570 --> 02:58:51.801
<v Speaker 3>psychology between men and women and why</v>
<v Speaker 3>women would gravitate towards different </v>

3965
02:58:51.801 --> 02:58:52.740
<v Speaker 3>careers and maybe that's why more women </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't in tech.</v>

3966
02:58:52.930 --> 02:58:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's ways to get women in tech </v>
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>

3967
02:58:55.141 --> 02:58:56.670
<v Speaker 3>You've taken that angle before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3968
02:58:56.671 --> 02:58:58.740
<v Speaker 3>with women and fighting and women in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

3969
02:58:58.741 --> 02:58:59.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3970
02:58:59.430 --> 02:59:01.890
<v Speaker 3>There's some women that are not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be into those things.</v>

3971
02:59:01.891 --> 02:59:06.891
<v Speaker 3>There's something going on that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be wherever they are in </v>

3972
02:59:06.891 --> 02:59:07.020
<v Speaker 3>comParison to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less likely that a woman's going to</v>

3973
02:59:07.021 --> 02:59:12.021
<v Speaker 3>be into fighting than a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's extraordinary to </v>

3974
02:59:12.021 --> 02:59:12.300
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of women are into it.</v>

3975
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:17.510
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just we're looking at human </v>

3976
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:21.261
<v Speaker 3>beings like if you're an outlier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a woman who really loves to </v>

3977
02:59:21.261 --> 02:59:21.261
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3978
02:59:21.261 --> 02:59:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>

3979
02:59:22.291 --> 02:59:25.620
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying it's much more rare that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman who wants to,</v>

3980
02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:27.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do become a nurse or do something that's</v>

3981
02:59:27.961 --> 02:59:31.020
<v Speaker 3>traditionally a female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a care giver,</v>

3982
02:59:31.021 --> 02:59:33.000
<v Speaker 3>sort of a position which is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>common.</v>

3983
02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:38.120
<v Speaker 3>And I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the letter memo indicate like this </v>

3984
02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:41.720
<v Speaker 3>that science says women were less </v>
<v Speaker 3>predisposed to becoming programmers or </v>

3985
02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:42.210
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3986
02:59:42.330 --> 02:59:45.060
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just was talking about gender.</v>

3987
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:50.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choices and choices people make and why </v>

3988
02:59:50.110 --> 02:59:51.190
<v Speaker 3>they make them based on personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>traits and how,</v>

3989
02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:54.390
<v Speaker 3>why things are more common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain things are more common in males.</v>

3990
02:59:54.480 --> 02:59:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Certain things are more common in women </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this would indicate why there </v>

3991
02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:02.871
<v Speaker 3>were less women that were involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>tech and it wasn't some systemic sort </v>

3992
03:00:02.871 --> 03:00:03.010
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3993
03:00:03.210 --> 03:00:07.230
<v Speaker 3>discrimination campaign put on by men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3994
03:00:07.470 --> 03:00:12.470
<v Speaker 3>But my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about them having all the </v>

3995
03:00:12.470 --> 03:00:13.170
<v Speaker 3>information that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like google and facebook,</v>

3996
03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:14.970
<v Speaker 3>how much inflammation they hit on you.</v>

3997
03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:18.990
<v Speaker 3>It would make me less nervous if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know about that,</v>

3998
03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:21.030
<v Speaker 3>how they handle that google memo thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm like,</v>

3999
03:00:21.031 --> 03:00:24.240
<v Speaker 3>well you guys aren't being honest about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what this is what the guy wrote.</v>

4000
03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:29.280
<v Speaker 3>You're paying the guy out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>villain and you think if you fire him </v>

4001
03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and drown this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this story goes out.</v>

4002
03:00:30.091 --> 03:00:35.091
<v Speaker 3>And then you guys get to look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors and then you </v>

4003
03:00:35.091 --> 03:00:37.890
<v Speaker 3>don't take the heat from the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it was an objective analysis of</v>

4004
03:00:37.891 --> 03:00:38.820
<v Speaker 3>this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>WeLl,</v>

4005
03:00:38.821 --> 03:00:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

4006
03:00:39.601 --> 03:00:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Mark zuckerberg has a lot of incentive </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be totally honest in this chase.</v>

4007
03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Either he's totally honest and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>malicious or he's totally honest and </v>

4008
03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.610
<v Speaker 3>he's almost comically ignorant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things.</v>

4009
03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he's saying,</v>

4010
03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:56.780
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's almost got to say he </v>

4011
03:00:56.780 --> 03:00:56.780
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is that they improve.</v>

4012
03:00:56.780 --> 03:01:01.320
<v Speaker 3>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should know though is I feel like </v>

4013
03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:01.320
<v Speaker 3>also</v>

4014
03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>part of the thing he should know now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him saying he doesn't know what if they </v>

4015
03:01:04.980 --> 03:01:09.541
<v Speaker 1>can pull up an email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't mean what if they have access </v>

4016
03:01:09.541 --> 03:01:09.541
<v Speaker 1>to all of his emails and it shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows.</v>

4017
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:14.670
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to yesterday about it and </v>

4018
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.670
<v Speaker 4>we were like worried about the facebook </v>
<v Speaker 4>recording thing.</v>

4019
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:18.661
<v Speaker 4>Is anybody gonna bring that up and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was brought up and he said that they </v>

4020
03:01:18.661 --> 03:01:18.661
<v Speaker 4>don't record audio.</v>

4021
03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Facebook doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4022
03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about it with google </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't.</v>

4023
03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about it with google </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you talk,</v>

4024
03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>if you were talking in a room about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain subject,</v>

4025
03:01:27.540 --> 03:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4026
03:01:29.091 --> 03:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the apple home pod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've.</v>

4027
03:01:30.860 --> 03:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been talking about something in a</v>

4028
03:01:32.661 --> 03:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>room and then had pop up ads pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4029
03:01:35.530 --> 03:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it.</v>

4030
03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4031
03:01:37.101 --> 03:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it though.</v>

4032
03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had it.</v>

4033
03:01:39.350 --> 03:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It happened to me before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

4034
03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you what were the </v>

4035
03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>signals went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've definitely had strain.</v>

4036
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It could be a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had strange ads pop up that </v>

4037
03:01:51.790 --> 03:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

4038
03:01:51.790 --> 03:01:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I don't know if it's accurate </v>

4039
03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:58.141
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was reading that there people </v>

4040
03:01:58.141 --> 03:01:59.581
<v Speaker 4>have tried to prove and it could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on facebook side just to give </v>

4041
03:01:59.581 --> 03:02:02.161
<v Speaker 4>them propaganda that that's almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly impossible to do right now just </v>

4042
03:02:02.161 --> 03:02:04.060
<v Speaker 4>because of the technology would take to </v>
<v Speaker 4>record your audio,</v>

4043
03:02:04.061 --> 03:02:07.900
<v Speaker 4>have it scanned by something and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>deliver an ad to you based off of that.</v>

4044
03:02:07.901 --> 03:02:08.160
<v Speaker 4>And amanda.</v>

4045
03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible.</v>

4046
03:02:09.861 --> 03:02:14.861
<v Speaker 1>I could have looked at something similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a recent time when it was just far </v>

4047
03:02:14.931 --> 03:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>enough away for me to not make an exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

4048
03:02:17.061 --> 03:02:22.061
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It represents those that you recognize </v>

4049
03:02:22.061 --> 03:02:24.791
<v Speaker 1>that that is potentially in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for things like alexa and things </v>

4050
03:02:24.791 --> 03:02:29.741
<v Speaker 1>like home pod and the devices that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to listen to your voice or </v>

4051
03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole point of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4052
03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>all this good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know dude.</v>

4053
03:02:36.141 --> 03:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of shit done.</v>

4054
03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm real productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know I can,</v>

4055
03:02:41.660 --> 03:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have things that are,</v>

4056
03:02:43.551 --> 03:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>would Be very difficult to find that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be delivered,</v>

4057
03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

4058
03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

4059

03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I love my traffic car and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got the old school,</v>

4063
03:03:03.861 --> 03:03:08.861
<v Speaker 1>removable hard top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I needed to get the stand to put the </v>

4064
03:03:08.861 --> 03:03:08.861
<v Speaker 1>hard top on when it took it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4065
03:03:09.410 --> 03:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Amazon 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a stand for a 2011 mercy delivered</v>

4066
03:03:15.651 --> 03:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4067
03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:19.310
<v Speaker 1>That level of convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4068
03:03:19.490 --> 03:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll give up a little privacy little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

4069
03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

4070
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it up.</v>

4071
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:25.940
<v Speaker 1>You can have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's gonna get us.</v>

4072
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to get us to turn us</v>
<v Speaker 1>into machines.</v>

4073
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Just give up a little bit here a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit here.</v>

4074
03:03:31.490 --> 03:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give up all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm definitely opposed to the drive</v>

4075
03:03:35.181 --> 03:03:36.980
<v Speaker 1>vehicle tracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4076
03:03:36.981 --> 03:03:37.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4077
03:03:37.791 --> 03:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about having a car that,</v>

4078
03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that knows where you've been and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody about it.</v>

4079
03:03:41.890 --> 03:03:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a certain company does do that,</v>

4080
03:03:44.390 --> 03:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>what will companies this will tesla's </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where you been well done,</v>

4081
03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:53.960
<v Speaker 1>don't they all by virtue of their gps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tesla's are wirelessly connected to </v>

4082
03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason.</v>

4083
03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:58.220
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason tesla</v>

4084
03:03:58.230 --> 03:04:03.230
<v Speaker 2>semi autonomous system works as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does and part of the reason tesla is </v>

4085
03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>doing what they're doing as a company is</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car's all tesla's on the road are </v>

4086
03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:11.220
<v Speaker 2>collecting mapping data for tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4087
03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:13.550
<v Speaker 2>in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can,</v>

4088
03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be ethical with that data or they </v>

4089
03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:20.771
<v Speaker 2>cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And odds are they don't give a shit </v>

4090
03:04:20.771 --> 03:04:22.331
<v Speaker 2>where you're going other than to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>them figure out where to put the next </v>

4091
03:04:22.331 --> 03:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>superchargers and and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in general you have to assume that </v>

4092
03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>to improve your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you extrapolate this 50 years </v>

4093
03:04:29.560 --> 03:04:31.310
<v Speaker 2>down the road and some of our privacy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>get worn away,</v>

4094
03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you could end up with a car that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4095
03:04:34.100 --> 03:04:39.100
<v Speaker 2>where it's very easy to subpoena the </v>
<v Speaker 2>records of your tesla and find out </v>

4096
03:04:39.100 --> 03:04:41.690
<v Speaker 2>exactly where you went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a test that would be the worst car if</v>

4097
03:04:41.691 --> 03:04:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you were like a bank robber.</v>

4098
03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Fuck ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need a hundred miles analog,</v>

4099
03:04:47.020 --> 03:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>analog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fuel tank.</v>

4100
03:04:48.231 --> 03:04:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Think transporter one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jason statham.</v>

4101
03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:53.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fuel cell.</v>

4102
03:04:54.290 --> 03:04:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Late model car.</v>

4103
03:04:56.540 --> 03:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>What's that in invisible black again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vanna black.</v>

4104
03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Phantom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black car?</v>

4105
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one right now.</v>

4106
03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:08.030
<v Speaker 2>We haven't painted anything like big in </v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a bright future.</v>

03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:20.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to jump in yet and I don't </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

4161
03:07:24.961 --> 03:07:26.130
<v Speaker 2>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>

4162
03:07:26.131 --> 03:07:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but in an urban environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see why it's a nice experience.</v>

4163
03:07:29.101 --> 03:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>When I drive An electric car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the fisker.</v>

4164
03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:34.320
<v Speaker 2>When I drive an electric car and I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm going,</v>

4165
03:07:34.530 --> 03:07:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I am noticeably more relaxed than when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving a gas car,</v>

4166
03:07:39.361 --> 03:07:41.340
<v Speaker 2>especially if I'm driving like allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>sportscar.</v>

4167
03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4168
03:07:42.091 --> 03:07:42.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4169
03:07:42.510 --> 03:07:47.510
<v Speaker 2>The goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those vibrations and stuff go through </v>

4170
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:50.970
<v Speaker 2>your body and kind of like stick with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you versus the serenity of that silence.</v>

4171
03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Just the 250 mile range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It annoys the shit out of me.</v>

4172
03:07:55.891 --> 03:07:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4173
03:07:56.251 --> 03:07:56.850

<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

4174
03:07:56.880 --> 03:08:01.880
<v Speaker 2>They need infrastructure like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>considering how many teslas are in los </v>

4175
03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:01.880
<v Speaker 2>angeles.</v>

4176
03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:04.980
<v Speaker 2>There's an embarrassingly small number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of superchargers in the city.</v>

4177
03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:10.100
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of places to charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tesla outside of your home and they </v>

4178
03:08:10.100 --> 03:08:15.020
<v Speaker 2>really need to do the infrastructure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to come up with a faster </v>

4179
03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:18.480
<v Speaker 2>charging solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which porsche it seems may have done.</v>

4180
03:08:19.140 --> 03:08:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Porsche has a new electric car coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out called the mission e,</v>

4181
03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>which is a tesla fighting thing and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly have a fast charging system </v>

4182
03:08:28.770 --> 03:08:32.460
<v Speaker 2>that can do like an 80 percent charge in</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes or something.</v>

4183
03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

4185
03:08:37.350 --> 03:08:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes is pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes is fast.</v>

4186
03:08:39.690 --> 03:08:42.870
<v Speaker 2>If you get three right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have three to five.</v>

4187
03:08:43.370 --> 03:08:45.160
<v Speaker 2>10 is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 works.</v>

4188
03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Ten's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a competitor is good because you </v>

4189
03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:50.640
<v Speaker 2>know tesla's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't charge them for free anymore.</v>

4190
03:08:51.270 --> 03:08:53.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three's and the new ones,</v>

4191

03:09:03.690 --> 03:09:08.690
<v Speaker 2>How long was it free for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At 2013 the model s came out and four </v>

4196
03:09:09.061 --> 03:09:14.061
<v Speaker 2>years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens when you pull into the </v>

4197
03:09:14.061 --> 03:09:16.490
<v Speaker 2>airport and you go to one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric spots per credit card or you </v>

4198
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:20.571
<v Speaker 2>have a rfid fob or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck these motherfuckers gotta pay to </v>

4199
03:09:21.301 --> 03:09:26.301
<v Speaker 2>play my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't they figure out how with all </v>

4200
03:09:26.301 --> 03:09:26.850
<v Speaker 2>the sun in la to have a solar powered </v>
<v Speaker 2>car?</v>

4201
03:09:27.090 --> 03:09:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

4202
03:09:29.010 --> 03:09:33.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just not possible with photovoltaic</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells to generate enough much.</v>

4203
03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes so much juice to move a 4,000</v>

4204
03:09:37.021 --> 03:09:42.021
<v Speaker 2>pound car down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much more than turning on a light or </v>

4205
03:09:42.021 --> 03:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>playing a radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that mass movement.</v>

4206
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:50.990
<v Speaker 2>It takes so much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fisker had something on the roof that </v>

4207
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>powers the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4208
03:09:51.900 --> 03:09:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there are a couple of company.</v>

4209
03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:02.280
<v Speaker 2>FiSker was one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else did a photo voltaic roof </v>

4210
03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:02.800
<v Speaker 2>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it likes circulates the climate,</v>

4211
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:07.830
<v Speaker 2>the air when it's really hot out or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can pre turn on certain things and shit </v>

4212
03:10:08.561 --> 03:10:09.210
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4213
03:10:09.211 --> 03:10:14.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not enough to run or charge a </v>

4214
03:10:14.211 --> 03:10:16.621
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if that's gonna change in the </v>

4215
03:10:16.621 --> 03:10:18.271
<v Speaker 2>future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they don't have solar panels </v>

4216
03:10:18.271 --> 03:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they come that far yet?</v>

4217
03:10:19.060 --> 03:10:21.610
<v Speaker 2>We'll test a solar as a roof tile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this.</v>

4218
03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4219
03:10:22.390 --> 03:10:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Tesla roof tile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4220
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:29.550
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to do a tesla solar tile </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes on your roof that then will </v>

4221
03:10:29.550 --> 03:10:32.950
<v Speaker 2>feed into the tesla battery pack that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hangs on your wall.</v>

4222
03:10:33.230 --> 03:10:38.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can be a autonomous </v>

4223
03:10:38.230 --> 03:10:38.230
<v Speaker 2>basIcally sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're still in the grid.</v>

4224
03:10:38.230 --> 03:10:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you give money back to the,</v>

4225
03:10:39.890 --> 03:10:41.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they do that they want,</v>

4226
03:10:41.230 --> 03:10:42.940
<v Speaker 2>they don't want you being completely off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grid.</v>

4227
03:10:42.940 --> 03:10:45.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't want the grid that died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4228
03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:48.970
<v Speaker 2>people are really worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm building a building right now,</v>

4229
03:10:49.090 --> 03:10:51.730
<v Speaker 2>so get this la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm a democrat,</v>

4230
03:10:51.731 --> 03:10:54.130
<v Speaker 2>but la will make you want to hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself building shit.</v>

4231
03:10:54.970 --> 03:10:58.690
<v Speaker 2>So I have to prep my building for solar </v>
<v Speaker 2>panels,</v>

4232
03:10:58.870 --> 03:11:03.870
<v Speaker 2>whether I put them on or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I put them on their $92,000</v>

4233
03:11:05.170 --> 03:11:08.440
<v Speaker 2>to cover the roof and solar panels and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will pay.</v>

4234
03:11:08.710 --> 03:11:13.710
<v Speaker 2>They pay themselves off in seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I generate swelled thousand dollars </v>

4235
03:11:14.471 --> 03:11:19.471
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year in power and then after that I'm </v>

4236
03:11:19.471 --> 03:11:23.041
<v Speaker 2>fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully positive and the city will pay me </v>

4237
03:11:23.041 --> 03:11:26.290
<v Speaker 2>every year and they pay themselves off </v>
<v Speaker 2>in seven years and the life span of them</v>

4238
03:11:26.291 --> 03:11:31.291
<v Speaker 2>is 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could potentially have many years </v>

4239
03:11:31.291 --> 03:11:31.450
<v Speaker 2>of free power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4240
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

4241
03:11:33.580 --> 03:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>you're building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm building a collector car storage </v>

4242
03:11:38.580 --> 03:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's where I plug it.</v>

4243
03:11:38.580 --> 03:11:39.550
<v Speaker 2>It's called west side collector car </v>
<v Speaker 2>storage.</v>

4244
03:11:39.790 --> 03:11:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be in playa vista,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

4245
03:11:42.281 --> 03:11:45.040
<v Speaker 2>which is the sweet new part of la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful area.</v>

4246
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know where the clippers practice </v>

4247
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>facility is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seeing that?</v>

4248
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.470
<v Speaker 2>It's right next to the fox hills mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right by lax,</v>

4249
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.510
<v Speaker 2>venice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's conveniently located.</v>

4250
03:11:52.900 --> 03:11:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to have storage for 150 </v>

4251
03:11:57.900 --> 03:11:59.020
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be secure climate control,</v>

4252
03:11:59.050 --> 03:12:00.430
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal.</v>

4253
03:12:00.610 --> 03:12:05.610
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it as an investment or as </v>

4254
03:12:05.610 --> 03:12:05.610
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a business.</v>

4255
03:12:05.610 --> 03:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>He has a business ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great for customers is not,</v>

4256
03:12:06.161 --> 03:12:11.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for me and we're building a </v>

4257
03:12:11.161 --> 03:12:11.161
<v Speaker 2>cool studio there like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've got.</v>

4258
03:12:11.161 --> 03:12:14.791
<v Speaker 2>instead of my shanti little studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to do a podcast and the </v>

4259
03:12:14.791 --> 03:12:17.530
<v Speaker 2>podcast studio is going to be elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have car stackers,</v>

4260
03:12:17.560 --> 03:12:22.300
<v Speaker 2>so I've 24 high stackers and the studio </v>
<v Speaker 2>is elevated.</v>

4261
03:12:22.300 --> 03:12:25.080
<v Speaker 2>And when just look out over the stacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

4262
03:12:25.090 --> 03:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be killer,</v>

4263
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:32.860
<v Speaker 2>but I have to comply with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>California environmental craziness.</v>

4264
03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I have to put a fire hydrant in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>like for the city,</v>

4265
03:12:36.460 --> 03:12:39.420
<v Speaker 2>like I have to do it for the city to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a building permit.</v>

4266
03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Well it kind of makes sense if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cars catch on fire.</v>

4267
03:12:43.301 --> 03:12:45.730
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of gasoline in that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

4268
03:12:45.731 --> 03:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4269
03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>The fire system that we have to build is</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>

4270
03:12:49.780 --> 03:12:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4271
03:12:50.861 --> 03:12:54.110
<v Speaker 2>And we have to have auxiliary pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It flows 3,500</v>

4272
03:12:54.111 --> 03:12:57.500
<v Speaker 2>gallons a minute in every car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the stacks,</v>

4273
03:12:57.830 --> 03:13:02.030
<v Speaker 2>every car on a stack has two nozzles at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it front and back,</v>

4274
03:13:02.190 --> 03:13:05.360
<v Speaker 2>while every car has its own set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nozzles.</v>

4275
03:13:05.390 --> 03:13:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if a fire starts over here,</v>

4276
03:13:08.211 --> 03:13:10.200
<v Speaker 2>it's completely contained over here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

4277
03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:12.590
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they kick on automatically</v>
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>

4278
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

4279
03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:17.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a really neat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm four years into this now,</v>

4280
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:21.560
<v Speaker 2>so broken ground yet hopefully next </v>
