Joe Rogan podcast

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.720
through the wonders of the Internet.
We've come together,
these guys.
Um,

34
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.650
there's a guy named balls of steel to thank for us finding out about show them,

35
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.300
that's his name on the Rogan board.

36
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.130
His name is balls of steel and balls of steel sent me this,
uh,
this,

37
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.460
yeah,
I guess was really little.

38
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.210
They're little balls of steel to be rattling around and they don't have to be

39
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:25.380
big goals to just a little tiny ones.
Probably a lot of tissue.
I barely feel it.

40
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.500
He sent me a message saying this is going to be your new favorite song.

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.830
And I was like,
okay,
whatever.
You know,
I don't know this guy.

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.690
I've never had any interactions with them.
It sounds like,
you know.
Yeah.
Well I,

43
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.730
you know,
I dunno.
I'm,
he nailed it.
Whatever it is.
Maybe it's just,

44
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.700
it was so good that he just knew that all someone had to do was hear it.

45
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.550
And that sounds like so corny.
I,
it sounds,

46
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.540
it sounds like very showbizzy when,
when you know,
when,

47
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.530
when entertainers compliment each other cause it sounds like some academy award

48
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:54.150
bullshit or you know,
you know what I mean?

49
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:57.330
Like when when someone sees someone and it goes,
wow,
you guys are really good.

50
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.130
It doesn't,
does it?
I always go,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 1>Even if you didn't like him,
you would fucking act Durham,
you know,</v>

52
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.730
you would say like,
hey man,

53
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.530
I just want to tell you I really loved you in that movie.

54
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.700
He couldn't give a fuck about that movie.
You see,
you just say,

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.660
I want to really be clear that it's not that and this is the only way to,

56
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.360
you have to bring that up.
It's the white elephant in the room who they are.

57
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.670
Oh really?
Oh what's your last name is Timberlake.

58
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.950
Yeah.
By the way,
when you do that to people,

59
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:25.780
they know you're doing it to them and they just play it along.

60
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.680
So this dude sends me this link and I go to it and it's you guys on top of a

61
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.290
roof,
I guess like somewhere outside of La says live at the Esquire house.

62
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.150
Is that what it was?
And uh,
it was uh,
the song angel of death and I was like,

63
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:42.000
Holy Shit.
I was like,
this is like,
it was really originals,

64
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.040
like country Sorta twinkie and had a lot of like a lot of different elements to

65
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.220
it.
It's like the way the songwriting was really original and I was like,
wow,

66
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.600
what the fuck is this band?

67
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.670
So then I go on youtube journey and I just got into your shit and I,

68
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.870
I bought,
um,
Billy Jack on a,
on iTunes and I,

69
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.120
that's all I've listened to for like a fucking week and a half.
I've all,
I'm,

70
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm seriously thank you sir.
Was one of the best cds I've heard in years.

71
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.020
It's so rich and so complete.
The thing that freaked me out about it,
it's like,

72
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.800
how the fuck do I not know who you are is so good?

73
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.790
It's so good to me.
It was preposterous that I didn't know.

74
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.910
And it's uncomfortable to say that in front of some people but,

75
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.230
but it was really no one cares about you.
I don't believe it's not,

76
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.041
I don't believe his dad.

77
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.160
I believe you guys are on the launching pad and I think the Internet is,

78
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.250
I think you guys are going to get gigantic just from the Internet.
I really,

79
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.840
I just,
I think this is,
it's inescapable.
You guys are too good and you know,

80
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.760
went to see you the other night and seeing bands live for a comic is so

81
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.300
inspirational,
you know,
for me at least because like when you,

82
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.700
when you go see other comedians that's inspirational too.

83
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.190
But like I already know how to do that.
You know,
I already do that.

84
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.360
When I watch someone do something like music,
I have no musical talent at all.

85
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.300
Nothing I've done or how to play anything.
I don't know how to sing anything.

86
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.920
So for me it's so alien and so I'm watching you guys jam up there and I have no

87
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.430
sense of self in the equation.
There's no,
it's nothing like,
oh,

88
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:13.530
I don't know if I would play that like that.
Emily Shit,
I don't,

89
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.070
I don't know anything about music so I can just like apes,
just slack jaw like,

90
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.740
oh wow.
It's so to me that one of the most amazing things to watch is a,

91
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:27.600
a band performed live,
you know,
all you guys,
you guys were fucking amazing.

92
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.570
You guys are really good.

93
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.640
<v 2>This might be that show Biz thing that you were just talking about,
but it's,</v>

94
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.260
but it's not that cause I feel the same way about standup comics.

95
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.230
I feel like it takes the biggest balls out of any of the performing thing

96
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:39.780
because if it's not funny,
no one's going to laugh.
You know what I mean?

97
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:42.630
If we're done playing,
people are going to clap kind of no matter what you do.

98
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:45.540
And it's like an etiquette.
But if it's not funny people,

99
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.580
you just kind of up there.
Well,
and you're hanging

100
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.010
<v 1>Joey Diaz,
who's a good buddy of mine are enough to know who he is,
but he,
uh,</v>

101
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.920
he says it best.
He said,
his standup comedy is the hardest,

102
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.270
easiest thing you'll ever do,

103
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.750
and what he means by that is that it's really hard to get funny,

104
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.150
but one of you funny.
Then everything's easy.

105
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.290
Then you know how to a long as you stay in the frequency,
then you can,
you know,

106
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.960
you know what's up.
You know you know how to do it.
You know how to do it right.

107
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.490
You've got to just make sure you're completely concentrate on what you're doing.

108
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.280
Never disrespect the relationship you have to the audience.

109
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.980
As long as you get to a certain level,
you can do it fairly easily.

110
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.660
That's what it means.
But getting to that level,

111
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.610
it's like there's a lot of shit that happens.
It's a long process.

112
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.630
Do you go,
I mean,

113
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.520
do you go off your material and just kind of riff or you sticking?
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:33.860
You have to see that,
that that freaks me out.
That's my favorite time.

115
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.680
I love it when we're off the track and in the woods.
I love it.

116
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.130
This is one of my favorite times.
I love hecklers.
I secretly love hecklers.

117
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:43.040
I don't want them hurt their feelings,
but I love when Shit happens.

118
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.720
I just love the chaos of the moment.

119
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.890
<v 3>No,
just I think,
I think that's like where it's at.</v>

120
00:06:46.891 --> 00:06:49.810
Those the people that can can go off track and you know,

121
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.970
just bounce back and throw it in there and it being something that's totally off

122
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:57.830
the cuff because everybody knows when it's,
it's just repetitive leap.

123
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.220
<v 1>This is a little of that.
Well you know what,
also people know when it's stale,</v>

124
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.740
you know that the key to comics is,
you know,
you can only,

125
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.260
you only keep your stuff for a couple of years and you've got to just launch

126
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.540
into orbit.
You know,
like you guys like you'll,

127
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:12.860
you'll be playing la river for fucking decades.
That's on this amazing,

128
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:15.590
you'll be playing that when you're an old lady.
She used to buckle up.

129
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.760
Then when you're an old lady,
that song is awesome.

130
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.600
It's going to exist forever.
We will be just like old bits that I have man,

131
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.300
where they were like my best bits at a time.
I can't even touch them.

132
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:27.134
They're useless.

133
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.150
<v 3>Well think time.
Time.
Just change.</v>

134
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.310
<v 1>Well,
it's not even an area.
It's just,
you know,</v>

135
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.310
you can't just do your old Shit and then you forget how it goes.

136
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.530
And I stopped doing it for a while and you forget how it goes.

137
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.440
Like someone will yell out something and I'm like,
good luck with that one.

138
00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:43.200
I don't even know how that one goes.
We do the same thing,

139
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.330
<v 3>songs that we don't put,</v>

140
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.610
like when you're on tour and you play the same set over and over every night and

141
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:49.060
every once in a while you'll throw on a,
you know,

142
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:53.850
a different tune if you're feeling crazy or intoxicated.
And um,
you know,

143
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.810
people make a request and every once in a while we'll be crazy enough to play
it.

144
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.330
And there's been many times where I've forgotten the words.

145
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.950
And you Christina Aguilera it seriously,
it's Christina.

146
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.480
<v 1>She loved that with the Superbowl though.</v>

147
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.740
She did the national anthem and she fucked up the lyrics.
You forgot about that.

148
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.070
I'm just kidding.
That's tough though.
I mean,
you're playing in a stadium.
Listen,

149
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.890
that bitch is tripping.
I didn't know she's tripping.
I know she's tripping.

150
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:23.980
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what she's doing to get by,

151
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:28.570
but it's not green tea in yoga.
There's a lot going on there.
We stand with.

152
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.050
Christine had PTA.

153
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.590
She had period blood running down her statement that she was so horrifying.

154
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.120
Photo.
Have you seen this?
All that shit up.
Yeah.
Pull it up.
Pull it up.

155
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.410
You need to pull it up.
Christina Aguilera period.
Blood down,
leg photo.

156
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.110
[inaudible] shirts not face.
I'm not,
I'm not kidding.

157
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.870
Someone tried to say it was spray on Tan like what are you trying to make her

158
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:50.330
asshole look like midnight?
That's ridiculous.
No Way.

159
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:53.920
It could be that kind of volume.
I'm so scared.
It's don't be scared.
It's life.

160
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.980
It's part of life.
Christina,
I'm sure it's a good

161
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.970
<v 4>girl.
She's got a beautiful voice.
I'm not into that guy's singing cover.</v>

162
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:03.540
It's got a powerful voice.
Very pretty girl.
She's hot as fuck.

163
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.960
What was that dirty song that you had back in the day?
Is that what it's called?

164
00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:09.090
It's pretty cool.
Ready
and I'd like to again,

165
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.300
conmigo Charles a freight and come on over.
Okay.
Can I say that?

166
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.810
I definitely think that's a spray on Tan.
Brian,

167
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.450
look at how fucking rich and red that is.

168
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.240
I dated a girl that gets that shit done every three days and it forms a river.

169
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.500
It comes down your leg.
It's exactly like probably what it is.
Listen,

170
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:30.180
I'm going with period blood.
Fuck you assholes.
Party moving bitches.

171
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.520
Listen man,
that's so funny.
I don't think it's spraying onto,

172
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.820
that's period blood bro.
Dude,
that's your ass in the background.
Joe Behind us.
No,

173
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.470
couldn't be no wait,
meatier than that bro.

174
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.600
My ass is so much media.
That was sprint.
That was spring break.

175
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:53.360
2004 show back in the day.
Joe Joe was in myrtle beach.
Oh my God.

176
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.200
Do I gotta do gotta get by?
What?
So,
um,

177
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.790
you know,
meeting you guys,
um,
through Twitter is like a,
this is like a,

178
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.000
the first time I've ever met a band through Twitter and then had the band come

179
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.750
on the show,
you know,
this is,
this is a very interesting phenomenon.
I mean,

180
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.460
these are really strange times we live in.

181
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.070
It really is because if we lived in another era,
I would have to hear,

182
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.640
but you guys in the radio and then,
uh,

183
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.300
there's no way I would meet you unless I ran into you somewhere.
You know,

184
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.870
I can't just tweet you and go,
holy,
you guys,
you guys are the shit.
Can't do that.

185
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.380
You know,
that bizarre thing.
Very bizarre.
But back then,
you know,

186
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.510
I think about this a lot back then there was probably,

187
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.080
while I'm pulling this out of my ass,
but for every hundred thousand bands,

188
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.870
I love wood.
That was my answer.
Exactly what it sounded like.

189
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.630
He'd probably like a 10th as many bands,
you know what I mean?

190
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.390
So you have a better chance maybe,
I dunno,
that doesn't make sense.
That's true.

191
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.250
Mathematically.
Or they're more balanced that I think there's,

192
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.500
who's responsible for that Internet?
Yeah,
the Austin,
Texas.

193
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.070
Only the Internet is in Texas with this horse.
Yeah.
I'm in Austin,
TX,
populating.

194
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.310
Ever listened to the,
you see,
they have like public access and they have like,

195
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.770
you know,
local bands are constantly playing in public access.

196
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.570
A lot of bands in Austin,
Texas.
This is the truth.
You guys are from uh,
Ohio.

197
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.040
Cleveland.
Cleveland.
Yes.
And where are you from?
I'm from New York.
He,

198
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.450
Massachusetts area couple of York.
Well,
you know,

199
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.080
I lived in New York a couple of places,

200
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:16.710
the city upstate and then I lived in Massachusetts as well.
We met in la though.

201
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.360
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Cool.
And you guys met,
uh,
how'd you meet?

202
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.030
Did you meet like we use a class or some shit?
Yeah,

203
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:29.310
that's sort of aftermath.
Tell everybody your names.

204
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.920
I'm Suzanne Santo.
My name is Ben Jaffe and uh,

205
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.600
we are,
hey honey,
honey,

206
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.110
<v 3>honey.
It that like you,
you've sort of like,
you know,</v>

207
00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.810
you're saying all these great things about our band and like,
you know,
you,

208
00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:48.490
you orbit around this,
this,
you know,
world,
this community of,
you know,
like,

209
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.550
uh,
UFC fighting and all this crazy like,
you know,

210
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:53.700
you're talking about Christina Aguilera's period,
block

211
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.210
and work all honey honey.
And it's,
you know,

212
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:03.211
it's commendable for you to embrace us with open arms with such a

213
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.030
<v 1>nipple juice softy.
I'm a Softie,
you know,</v>

214
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.640
I really am.
I'm,
I'm wrapped up in a lot of other crazy shit,
but,
um,
um,

215
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.200
I'm trying to be as nice as possible.

216
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.710
One of your fans made fun of Our Name on Twitter,
but we fucking his,
yeah,

217
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.730
probably hates his life.
There's a lot of people on Twitter that hate their life.

218
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:21.980
You know what?

219
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.520
There's a lot of people out there in the world that just want to scratch.

220
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.910
They just want to reach out and clock.
Nobody took care of them.
Why?

221
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:30.730
Because it's a complicated cycle of life and it doesn't make any sense.

222
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:34.240
And everybody's got a place and you don't even necessarily want to be in that

223
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:39.120
place,
but you're stuck through circumstances.
I'm no good.
You know,

224
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.490
we,
we worked it out.
That's not worth it.
Listen,
you keep doing that.

225
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.080
Keep doing that.
You'll never no time for anything else.
Yeah.
You'll have a,

226
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.150
well honey,
honey is top performing,
but they're full time.
Get a tweet.

227
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.910
Looks all they're going to do be,
he'll be less of a dick now.

228
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.900
Maybe there's a chance.
Yeah,
maybe.
Maybe.
Did you just say like re reply,
hater,

229
00:12:55.901 --> 00:13:00.340
hater?
No,
no,
no.
He basically,
yes.

230
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.220
<v 3>He was like,
hey Joe,</v>

231
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:05.070
why don't you ask him where they came up with such a god awful band name?

232
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.690
<v 1>You responded.
I responded.
I just very sensitive.</v>

233
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.910
I'm going to help you guys in our band name was inspired by your mom.
Oh.

234
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.560
Oh,
hi.
Yeah.

235
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.610
We really,
that shut him up,
but yeah,
we decided this is Mama.
He didn't even know.

236
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.480
You could have been a dude that said that.
Maybe you just spoke his language.

237
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.270
Yeah,
that's what I was hoping you would say.
Yeah.
Let's keep going with this,

238
00:13:29.271 --> 00:13:32.180
which is totally fucked up.
Yeah.
Well that's a lot of the world.

239
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.000
I was hoping you'd say you boom my mind.
Oh yeah,

240
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.700
that's you're hoping it would be crazy.
That's what he is.
Yeah.
See,

241
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:40.760
I'm already in trouble.
Role playing.
I was role playing,
right?
You can't.

242
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.940
You gotta learn how to deal with trolls.
This is a lesson that,

243
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.811
this is a good point.

244
00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:47.630
It's good that you came to us before you guys blow up because we're going to

245
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:50.540
help you tremendously because going to be a line of people and they,
they're,

246
00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:52.850
they're what's called trolls.
You know what trolls are writing on the Internet,

247
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.250
the mythical creature.
No,
no,
no.
They're the people that are real.

248
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.430
And what they do is they say things to try to get you to respond.

249
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.370
All you have to do is respond.
They'll go,
oh,
trolled you.

250
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.140
This is how low and the game is.
The game is so low end.

251
00:14:06.141 --> 00:14:09.560
It's like say anything mean anything horrible,
anything ridiculous,

252
00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:13.490
anything preposterous,
anything accusatory.
Lie,
make up shit.

253
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:17.180
Point out things that are completely our Twitter Sensei and I'm a help you.

254
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:19.940
I'm going to help you.
And all they're trying to do is get you to go,

255
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.120
what the fuck?
Who are you?
And they're like,
Yay.

256
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.910
That's all they want you to do.
They want you,

257
00:14:25.911 --> 00:14:28.940
they want to get a re a green light.
We want to get a green light.

258
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.870
So they might send out,
they might send Jose Conseco a thousand tweets.

259
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.980
You know what's funny though,

260
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.080
day when I did it and I felt overly emotional and maybe that's great,
is don't,

261
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.320
don't,
uh,
maybe I should like Twitter off when were boozing,

262
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.250
the real issue is there's too many people that you're going to interact with in

263
00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:47.810
your individual one on time.

264
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:51.800
It is impossible for one on one time to interact with that many people.

265
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.860
So you got to like choose who you can interact with and you can go back and

266
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:58.220
forth at some cunt face with the only reason why you're going back and forth.

267
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.770
He said something rude,
they said something rude to get you and Tyson.

268
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.600
There's plenty of people that won't do that.
So that's why blocking is awesome.

269
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:07.850
Just don't argue with them.
Just block it.
It's hard to do.

270
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.870
It's really easy to just fucking go.
Fuck you.

271
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.570
<v 3>Block 10 people a day.
Black people.
Oh my God,
you didn't know that.</v>

272
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.640
Oh that's you guys need,

273
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.650
you guys needed mentors tweeted out of by trolls right now

274
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:29.080
dickheads trolling eight easy Dick.
It's troll.
It ain't easy.

275
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.000
Oh,
that's funny.
It ain't easy.

276
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.731
<v 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

277
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:35.690
I'm not saying the Trojans easing some trolling is kinda tricky.
You know,

278
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.360
there's a lot involved in that.
You know,
you gotta,

279
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:40.040
you gotta pretend you've got to get people mad,

280
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:43.430
you got to fit what's going to really get Ben fired up that he's gonna respond

281
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:46.160
and get really shitty with this.
Very difficult.
I'm very calm.

282
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.800
You say that he starts going after some,
you know,

283
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:52.770
finds out about some ex-girlfriend on Twitter and the attack,
the,

284
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.560
all they trying to do is just get you to respond.

285
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.010
So we tried to just try and get you to respond.
You love personal man.

286
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.820
They do need love.

287
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.540
They would way rather talk to you and be buddies most likely if you actually met

288
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:06.620
them,
but you know there's no fun in that.
We will be your friend.

289
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.390
Okay?
You start out there and making a mistake.
You're making it.

290
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.520
We will give you our credit card numbers.
Personally,

291
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.880
you should be friends with a lot of people that there's a lot of people out

292
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:19.670
there to be friends with,
but there's don't,
don't try to tame the cons.

293
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.343
I feel like we should

294
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.350
<v 3>turn this podcast into a drinking game.
Every time you say con,</v>

295
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.200
somebody has to drink black outcast.
He went a blackout counseling.

296
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:30.510
Someone wants a woke up for real.
Yeah.

297
00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:33.440
It's a podcast I do where we drink a whole bottle Yeager meister and an hour.

298
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:36.240
That sounds awful,
but we have to finish it in one hour.
Can we,

299
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:38.670
can we make it like Wisconsin?
We're not doing that.

300
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.870
We're not going to kill honey.
Honey.
How dare you bro.
I love them.

301
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:47.370
I don't want it to be easy,
Brian.
We can't kill them.
Which you know,
listen,

302
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.780
Joe Rogan is the angel of death.

303
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.550
<v 1>I'm just trying to hook you guys up and trying to keep you guys moving in any</v>

304
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:56.960
way possible.
I want you guys to make more cds,
keep it coming.
Keep a calm.
Oh,

305
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:59.780
you don't have to be grateful.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
So that's the,

306
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.980
that's reward enough.

307
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.430
It's this amazing opportunity to be able to tell people about somebody.
I,

308
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.610
and I've never had a venue before,
but before this podcast there's no,

309
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.080
or before Twitter or any of this social media stuff,
there's no way.
You know,

310
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.520
even like something like you had to wait for an interview and go,

311
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.160
oh fuck this new bands.
Amazing.
You know,
by the time you do that,
you know,

312
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.980
the interview gets in a magazine.
It's months later now.
Just immediately.

313
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.380
<v 3>We know it's tough because radio is a dying breed and we're not necessarily a</v>

314
00:17:25.381 --> 00:17:29.470
radio band.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean I guess we could be,
are you saying this

315
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.580
<v 1>is radio?
Yeah,
this is,
this is the real radio.
This is,</v>

316
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:37.690
I mean there's not a radio station except for like Sirius satellite radio that

317
00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:41.200
gets as many listeners is this thing,
so that's amazing.
Yeah.
The weird,

318
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.800
the weird thing about the internet is that nobody even saw this coming,
you know,

319
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:48.100
they just,
somehow or another I will,
we're going to deal with and snap pictures.

320
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:50.380
I'll send you a picture,
whatever.
Nobody ever saw it.

321
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.780
Fucking file sharing and streaming shows and everything.

322
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:57.510
Free the,
what are they doing?
They're putting it out for free.

323
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.360
What the fuck and then this other model,

324
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.590
the radio model just kind of evaporates and there's no cds.
Cds.

325
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:06.510
That's like five more years.
That's insane.

326
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.970
I remember when I was a kid and they first came out with cds.
I'm like,

327
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.150
who the fuck is going to get those things?
Don't we already have cassette?

328
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:16.050
Has this tape is going?
No.
Why are you going to set a good enough?

329
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.950
That's kind of something I'm going to miss is I'm a,

330
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.270
I'm a sucker for mix tapes or mixed cds.
Oh my God,
I love it.
But someone can,

331
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.770
the playlist playlist is called easy.

332
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.700
Someone can put that in your watch.

333
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.410
USB Watches that are also MP three players.
Do you have Spotify?
Have you seen,

334
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.270
do you have Spotify or we're going to share with your phones?

335
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.600
I'm kind of Spotify illiterate.
Oh,
it's great.

336
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:42.970
It's pretty much like a mixed tape that you can have Joe's mix tape.
You can,

337
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.090
oh yeah.
You make your own like page,
right.

338
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.420
It's pretty much like a Facebook page for musics.

339
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.670
It's so you should because look,

340
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.750
balls of steel is the guy that hooked me up with you guys mean.

341
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.780
I mean it's clear that that's,
he's out there.

342
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.590
He's probably shooting whiskey right into his dick with a Turkey baster.

343
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.020
Harvey's on my message board.

344
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.890
He can be doing anything right for a bunch of savages.

345
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.390
Part blood seven told me about Spotify.
Thank you.

346
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:13.260
Thank you for our boats out.

347
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:19.190
We've had this podcast or this message board I started in 1998 and it just sort

348
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:22.400
of took on a life of its own.
Now it's got like millions of posts,

349
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.280
like six over 6 million posts and it's just the craziest,

350
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:30.750
most interesting group of Weirdos mixed with [inaudible].
A lot of farm.

351
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.160
It's basically I'm farming,
you know,
I'm allowing them,

352
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.390
I even keep some of them around.

353
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:39.030
I have it set up so that when they're assholes or if they're rude or something

354
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:41.460
like that,
that gets sent to special ed and then they get us,

355
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.720
they get a pink name by keeping them around.

356
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.750
Just making them even come to your right.
Please.

357
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.450
May I?
No,
I need to get some ice,
but I figured out today,

358
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.580
are you serious?
You just really asked to get up.

359
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.990
You should have raised your hand,
dude.

360
00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:59.980
Why didn't you raise your fucking hand then?
We're going to,

361
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.720
we're going to have to become best friends to this.

362
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.310
This is weird bed getting hammered in front of each other and you're like,

363
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:12.630
may I please have some ice?
It's very respectful.
He's from,
he's from the Midwest.

364
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:17.070
Boy.
You're in New York,
Boston guy.
What?

365
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.780
I'm a that's,
that's sort of me too,
man.

366
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:22.050
I was born in New Jersey and I grew up mostly in Boston where my grandma lived

367
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:24.060
in Toms River.
When you think about,
oh,
Tom's river,

368
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:27.210
that's where the former UFC lightweight champion Frankie Edgar's from haulage

369
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.920
boy.
Shout out to Frankie.
I love that dude.
He just lost his title.

370
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:35.190
Unfortunately.
It's very,
very close decision and wants a rematch.

371
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.280
I support you Frankie Edgar in your bid for a rematch.
Good luck to you sir.

372
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.850
It's good man.
Frankie Edgar,
he's a beast.
I looked at shrimp out.

373
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.600
Who taught you?
Who taught you to do that?
From Wendy Wang.
Lady,

374
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:47.530
she beat the shit out of me.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah,

375
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.590
but I got that because I went and took one class with the Gracies.
Uh,

376
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.160
for people don't know what it is.
It's a form of HIPAA escaping.
Where are you?

377
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.290
You kind of get like a shrimp.

378
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.860
You get on your side and you kind of like Ben and kick like a shrimp and the

379
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:02.850
idea is to get out of a bad position.
So that's what,

380
00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.340
so I'm with that.
So you learned it from a woman.

381
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.750
She brought me to this Brazilian Jujitsu class and I'm shrimping all over the

382
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:14.470
fucking place.
That's awesome.
Did you like,
yeah,
but I did.
I did.
Dude,

383
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:17.410
I'll get you free lessons.
You want to train with my best friends,

384
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.380
one of the best Jujitsu instructors in the world.
If you want,
you guys ran.

385
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.760
Oh Dude,
you're in,
you're in.
You're in a totally hook you guys up.
It's done.

386
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.060
Done deal.
Just doesn't cut it anymore.
No,
it doesn't.

387
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:30.010
You could learn some nasty guard techniques.

388
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.680
See the thing about your legs is a woman,

389
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:35.200
you know physically is not going to be as strong as a man.
It's just no way.

390
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.650
It especially a big man,
but your legs are strong as fuck.

391
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.280
Your legs are carrying you around all day and you're running.
I mean,

392
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:44.970
think about that.
What you knew you could walk for hours,
you know,

393
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.680
try walking on your fucking hands for hours.

394
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.770
So it was a woman's legs are incredibly strong.
And if a woman learns Jujitsu,

395
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.530
I have friends like my friend Felicia.
Okay?
She's a woman,

396
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.030
she's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and she's only about 130 pounds and she's

397
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.230
ridiculously technical.
Like,
you know,
I'm,
I'm a,

398
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.760
a much bigger than her and I have a really hard time,

399
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.340
like just containing her and holding onto her.
She's just,

400
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.580
her technique is that good because not all of it.
She does everything.

401
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.020
She's a black belt.
She's super rare.
No.
So there was a,

402
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:14.651
there was a show,

403
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:17.950
I remember a guy named Seymour Butts who was like a porn star that had like a

404
00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:20.830
reality show on showtime where it was like,
you know,
his,

405
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:22.600
like it was a reality show about his life,

406
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:26.890
like co producing porn films and you know,
living his life and you know,
dating,

407
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:28.120
oh it was a real weird show.

408
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.570
But one of the things he wanted to do was he wanted to start taking Brazilian

409
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:35.140
jujitsu lessons and have him roll with a girl.

410
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.180
Like they thought that would be funny to have him run with a girl.

411
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.240
But I don't think he expected Felicia to fucking strangle him because when they,

412
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:46.180
when they started rolling,
she fucking man handled him.
I mean,

413
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:50.200
she's a little girl.
She's five foot five maybe,
you know,

414
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:54.130
maybe 130 pounds maybe.
And she's fucking shrine.

415
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.410
Lily's dude take it as ours is about to break of an arm bar and him and triangle

416
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.970
in them.
It was fucking chaos.
It was like over and over and over again.

417
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:02.700
She's just tapping him.
I mean,

418
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.120
when you're talking about the size of the dog in the fight here,

419
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.150
is it mainly about her and leverage?
It's all about,
no,

420
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:13.390
no,
no,
no,
she's not.
I mean she's a strong woman,
but she's a woman.

421
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.170
I mean it's not,

422
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.170
I mean you don't need to be that song if you have your shit together.
It's tech.

423
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.200
It's about her technique or technique is just that it's such a high level and

424
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:22.330
our defenses as such a high level and she just,

425
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.290
she knows exactly what she's doing so she doesn't have to exert nearly as much

426
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:29.350
force cause she's always in the right position and you know,

427
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.080
and she just like just technique.

428
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.090
It was wild to watch because I'd never seen like a man with no training go with

429
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:40.000
a woman who was a black belt.
So it was really intriguing.
It was funny,

430
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:43.600
she just ran right through crazy.
Like nothing.
Like she wasn't even tired.

431
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.220
That's like our friend Wendy.
She,
I mean,
not a black belt,
but she's

432
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.110
<v 2>been doing it for a couple of years and she beat the shit out of me.</v>

433
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.050
<v 1>It's fun.
Yeah.
Is she tried to beat the shit out of banking.</v>

434
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.000
I should totally do it.

435
00:23:52.001 --> 00:23:55.720
She'd have honey honey death matches at the end of your show.
Oh my God.

436
00:23:55.721 --> 00:23:59.620
We thought about,
we're working to,
Ben's like,

437
00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:01.140
what the fuck are we talk about training

438
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.260
<v 3>corporate,
other,
you know,
various</v>

439
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.980
<v 1>[inaudible] crafts and the carnival acts and violence.
We were crafts.</v>

440
00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.551
We're starting,

441
00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:11.660
we're starting with a basketball tournament that we actually see truth.

442
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.760
Oh really?
Yeah.
Oh,
basketball tournament for like charity or something.
Yeah.

443
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.460
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's going to be,
it's going to involve a show,</v>

444
00:24:17.461 --> 00:24:20.570
but like basically three on three,
like 10 minute games.

445
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.460
<v 2>All these other indie rock hose.
Yeah.</v>

446
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.950
<v 1>Los Angeles is just don't have anything to do with that,
um,</v>

447
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.720
organization that introduce you guys in Santa Monica.
There was no,
no,

448
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.260
no

449
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.940
<v 2>that,
that,
that's a different thing,
but we're just,</v>

450
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:35.060
we're trying to be as involved as possible in all these nonprofit things.

451
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:37.350
I'm like,
arts education is kind of,
are the,

452
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.770
<v 1>yeah,
we're trying to get,
explain,</v>

453
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.910
explain what that was because I thought that was really interesting.

454
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.400
<v 2>Well when we booked the show,
uh,</v>

455
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.000
a friend of mine who was booking the venue every Monday night,

456
00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:49.600
they would do a nonprofit that feature different nonprofit and the proceeds from

457
00:24:49.601 --> 00:24:51.790
the night would go to that nonprofit.
And he allowed us to choose.

458
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:56.650
And there's a group called Coachart,
which is a arts education funding.
You know,

459
00:24:56.651 --> 00:24:59.530
cause there's all these public schools that have literally no access to arts

460
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:02.540
education.
So you know,
I think there was drinks that night that uh,

461
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.850
went to at the door,
money went to uh,
this group.
Coachart.
Um,

462
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.290
and what we're,

463
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.710
what we're working on slowly is having this basketball tournament with us and a

464
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:15.100
bunch of,
you know,
other Los Angeles bans.

465
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.810
Cause I just want to play basketball.

466
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.260
<v 1>We just want to just love basketball.
I've looked past William,</v>

467
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.530
do you wish you were a big black guy?
Oh,
I wish I was in there.

468
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.020
If you were,
if you were a,
a big,
tall guy,

469
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:29.960
do you think that you'd be playing professional basketball or adapting to it?

470
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.040
I think if I,
yeah,
I think if I just took a different path with this body,

471
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.900
I go with the MBA.
Really good.
Yeah,

472
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.660
because I think it'd be excited for people to watch this with a wave of your

473
00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:42.940
hand.
This his body.
Yeah,
exactly.
You should have just a what's up,

474
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.830
you know,
about a year ago,
Ben,
right?

475
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.570
<v 3>Ben In all earnestness said to me,
he said,
he knows,
he's got to think,</v>

476
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:52.930
I got this great idea for a reality show and it's basically going to be me for

477
00:25:52.931 --> 00:25:55.630
an entire year training for the NBA

478
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.560
<v 1>because I could do it.
Who wouldn't?
Who wouldn't watch that.</v>

479
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.560
There's someone that looks like me could get into law.
I'll tell you what,

480
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:07.180
for real,
for real.
If you got,
how old are you?
I'm 26 it might be too late.

481
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.400
Not too late,
not too late.
It off.
My knees are gone.
No,
no,
no.

482
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.230
You say that they've got all kinds of new things they're doing now.
What?

483
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.320
What does it on cartilage?
What does it,
you know they're doing.

484
00:26:14.321 --> 00:26:17.650
They're taking your blood and they're putting it some sort of a centrifuge and

485
00:26:17.651 --> 00:26:20.560
then they take it out and shoot the fucking platelets right into your knee with

486
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:24.280
human growth hormone.
Really?
Shit.
Some stem regenerate tissue.
Yeah.

487
00:26:24.281 --> 00:26:26.700
There's a lot of that going on.
Hang in there fella.

488
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.990
I'm thinking about freezing my semen to,
yeah,
I've done.
Okay,
let's not,

489
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.010
let's not do that,
but I don't think so.
Let's take fish oil.
You taken fish oil.

490
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.800
None.
You've got to take fish.
Oil is very important for joints.

491
00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:42.820
Anytime you have sore joints.
Amazing.
Amazing.
Not just that.

492
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:44.280
It's good for mental property.

493
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.890
<v 4>Is that your spot?
That's my phone.
I shouldn't have left it on.
That's not cool.</v>

494
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.310
Come on.
We're drinking.
Phil Collins.
Interesting

495
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.280
to imagine what you're talking about it,
but

496
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.400
he's a vice cop.
Once you guys become famous,
once you guys become huge,

497
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:03.940
which you will to inevitable.
I'm,

498
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.060
I'm happy I'm at you now and you still talk to me.

499
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.490
But once you guys become famous,

500
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:11.850
then you on a reality show when you want to try to enter into the NBA,

501
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.350
that would be fucking awesome.

502
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.390
And then bouncing it in with your schedule of touring.

503
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.270
I want to be the executive producer.
Excellent.

504
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.200
We're actually looking for funding.
Um,
if you're interested,

505
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.210
obviously my mid range game is pretty good,

506
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:30.870
but I think I need to be on the arc is really what I need to develop with my
son.

507
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.160
How are you with battle rapping,

508
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.720
rapping and you battle rap cause that might come up.
You're a musician,
you know,

509
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:40.350
this is pretty good.
I mean,
I don't want any battle.
We'll see.
I mean,

510
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.220
you can battle rap.
I know I could get to a place where I'd be confident.
Yes.

511
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.330
I would say that if you,

512
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:48.960
if you're a young white boy like yourself and you're really good at basketball,

513
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.480
some shits come up.
Okay,
something's come up.

514
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:56.010
There's been some situations where you had to establish a position and the
let's,

515
00:27:56.011 --> 00:27:58.150
I mean I'm not,
Suzanne is very kind of,

516
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.490
I don't want to create a false image of myself in terms of how good I am at

517
00:28:01.491 --> 00:28:05.350
basketball,
but I will accept any challenges.
But you know,

518
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.000
little rec center for Christmas and we meet those 14 year old.

519
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:13.040
It was fucking awesome.
But we also did lose to support

520
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.770
and the rest of the band,
I wasn't
a few,

521
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.640
always been a big basketball fan,
could rebound like diaries.

522
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.960
What do you think about the color green tire?

523
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.740
No,
for real.
I just love the game.

524
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.790
I mean I used to play a lot of soccer,
but basketball,
I don't know,

525
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:44.300
I like it better.
It's,
it's so fast paced and it's like,
uh,

526
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.470
it's so much improvisation.
You know what I mean?

527
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:51.270
At least in his pickup basketball,
when he started talking about basketball,

528
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:56.090
he started going black.
Did you feel that he went a little hook on it?
We know,

529
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.670
you know,
we'll talk about that.
It's all about improvisation.
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.683
I'm just kidding.
Bad.

531
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880
There's a fine line between rock and roll and being a professional athlete.

532
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.490
Hmm.
I'll support that.
I think it's a big fat stupid lines.

533
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.670
There's a lot of difference there.
Actually,

534
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.660
I'm working on getting us littered with heroin needles before

535
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.600
they'll be dope.
Doing some warm ups.

536
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.250
Just like some seventies gangsters from New York.
It's fun times.

537
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.910
Jogging suits they're in.
They're in the mail.

538
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.650
Have you?
Yeah,
it's gross.
We're drinking this weird rum stuff.

539
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.040
Have you ever had interest in the music?
Um,
you know,
I,

540
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.300
<v 3>yes.
I actually moved to La for acting and really,</v>

541
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.270
really well for a little while.
Thank God you go here for that.

542
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.860
He abandoned that shit.
Right?
Did you,

543
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.780
it's way too cool to be an actress because you're willing to call.
Um,

544
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.790
no.
I worked for a number of years and,
and I just,
when I moved out to La,
I,
uh,

545
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.970
I went through my first breakup.
Wow.
Yeah,
please tell us more.

546
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.400
It was very dark times.
Oh No.

547
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.610
Does that inspire a good music pack down a few lbs.

548
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:14.470
I got really sad and I was so,
I wrote a lot of pathetic sad songs.

549
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.790
Yeah.
It was like really shit.
You're right when your heart's broken.

550
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.140
But you know what?

551
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:23.290
It was really funny because it was just like a crazy chain of events where like

552
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:27.220
I played a couple open mics because my roommate was a booker at the time and I

553
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:29.350
didn't know anybody.
I met my roommate on craigslist.
How long ago?

554
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:30.184
We're talking about,

555
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.750
I was 18 1927 oh nine years ago.

556
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.560
It's been seven years ago.
He's still fucking wait,

557
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.320
I'm in my late twenties and Ben is 26 and he is in his mid twenties or young

558
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:45.700
buck.
Yeah.
Wow.
Well it's all about,
what are you saying?
It's all about positivity,

559
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.534
y'all

560
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.720
<v 0>devotee.
So,
so we,
you just started going up on open mic nights</v>

561
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.830
<v 3>just fucking around.
Well,
you know,
it was crazy.
Like my first show,</v>

562
00:30:54.831 --> 00:30:59.180
I met all these people that I'm still friends with today and every time it just

563
00:30:59.181 --> 00:30:59.991
like snowballed.

564
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:04.910
And then I met Ben like maybe a couple months later and we started writing

565
00:31:04.911 --> 00:31:07.580
together and it really happened.

566
00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:12.050
Like we started putting some songs on my space.
That's what I'm saying.

567
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.840
<v 0>Thought about maybe you guys being the captain and Tennille Park too.</v>

568
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.830
<v 3>Oh,
I love that song.
Never thought of it.</v>

569
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.670
<v 0>Keep us together.
They're not bad man.
That's bad.
You're going to be good today.</v>

570
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.670
I like know it's been awesome.
So you guys immediately hit it off.

571
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.100
You meet.
What?
What's your impressions of Each Other?

572
00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.440
<v 3>I mean,
I always wondered how bands that work.
Work.</v>

573
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.990
We hit it off as friends and I was,
I was pretty green,
you know,
like I,

574
00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:45.550
I've always sang and I played the violin since I was a kid and,
um,
but I,

575
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.440
and I played a little guitar,
but Ben had been,

576
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:53.390
Ben had already written an entire record,
recorded it.
And um,
you know,

577
00:31:53.391 --> 00:31:57.500
he,
he kind of showed me the way the ropes,
if you will.

578
00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.890
<v 0>Ben,
what is it like for you man?
You're a musician.
You meet this chick,</v>

579
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:05.450
she can sing her ass off.
And w w what do you,
how you,
uh,

580
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:06.950
how did,
how does it become a band

581
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.130
<v 2>man?
I feel like the band stuff just happened.
I,
you know,</v>

582
00:32:11.131 --> 00:32:12.660
we kinda got outside forces,

583
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.520
like this situation outside forces just come around every once in a while.

584
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.120
I was compelled,
pushed us,
pushed us along honestly.
But the w you know,

585
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.380
when we play at first we were playing some songs that I'd written and Suzanne

586
00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:28.350
just sang them better than anybody else.
[inaudible] so it was,
uh,

587
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.530
I dunno,
it's Kinda like a no brainer.
I guess it was just like,
okay,

588
00:32:31.531 --> 00:32:32.910
this is girl can sing.

589
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.560
And then we started writing together and we just had a great relationship.

590
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.980
Did you have day jobs at the time?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I sold barbecue.

591
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.500
<v 1>Barbecue.
Yeah.
Those are,
those are my people.
Oh,
that's a good place.</v>

592
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.400
It's fantastic.

593
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:50.420
But I eman was only like 10 widgets where I lost 15 pounds when I stop working

594
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:53.260
with.
Sure,
sure.
Did you ever go to doctor Hughley wireless part?

595
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.580
The lobbies in Van Eyes?
Ooh,
it's worth the drive.
It's tasty.

596
00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.610
God Damn,

597
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:03.050
you gotta give yourself like a good like day to prepare and no food in the

598
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:06.410
morning.
Man.
Don't fuck with breakfast.
You got to go right there.
I go.
I,

599
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.150
I'd go there for like a 1:00 PM lunch breakfast sort of a thing.
It's ridiculous.

600
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.210
<v 2>You ever go to DC?
Yeah.
Washington oohs and Aahs who's an absence.</v>

601
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.580
That spot is the greatest.
I mean it's similar to baby blues.

602
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:21.360
This is soul food place.
So you were working baby blues.
Where were you working?

603
00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.430
I wasn't working at the time.
I was just like,

604
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.650
I was lucky enough I had Suzanne.
Right.

605
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.800
Do you know if my money?
Yeah,
exactly.
So you weren't,
you were teaching?

606
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.150
I was teaching guitar.
Um,
and uh,
I,

607
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:39.480
I was really lucky to be great friends with the producer named Andy Paley and I

608
00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:40.860
was working on all these cartoons.

609
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:45.680
I was like playing on this cartoon soundtracks.
I liked good food.
Yeah.

610
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.140
It's just like random.
Yeah,
it was hilarious.

611
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:51.650
So I got to do all these amazing TV projects,

612
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.560
<v 3>stuff like that.
Um,
you know,
I guess that would,</v>

613
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.820
<v 1>and then so you guys form a song,
this is what I want to know.
Who's,</v>

614
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.640
who's writing this stuff?
Are you guys writing it all together?

615
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.870
<v 3>Well now we are,
our,
our first record was a lot,</v>

616
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:10.250
half the record was Ben songs that he from his previous record that he recorded.

617
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:15.050
And um,
now are we,
we pretty much write everything together and um,

618
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:15.380
it's,

619
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.830
it's really interesting to like kind of just watch the whole thing developed

620
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:21.590
because it's,
you know,
we're,
we're getting better,

621
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:24.770
like our musicianship or writing or performing and it's like,

622
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:30.000
it's really cool to just keep striving for the next level.
And,

623
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:33.950
um,
we write all the time and sometimes we write for other people and it's,

624
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:38.030
it's become something that's really,
um,
you know,
I can humbly say like,

625
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.720
once you're secure with it,
it's so much fun.
Yeah.
You know,
because there,

626
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:45.620
there was a time when,
when I said,
you know,
like when I was younger,

627
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:49.610
19 and just getting started where I was so insecure about like,
oh my God,

628
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:52.130
is this sound like shit?
Is that stupid?
Is that Cliche,
you know,

629
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.970
and you just kind of trial and error.
I have to go with it.
And,
and now it's,

630
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:59.930
it's just like,
it's,
it's like kind of a whole nother entity.

631
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.160
It's like once you write a song,

632
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.660
you just kind of put it out there and it's really,
it's really fucking fun.

633
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.190
<v 1>And the big reward is in the creativity,
right?</v>

634
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:11.070
The big reward is in bringing something to life where it wasn't there,

635
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.710
that didn't exist and through you or collaboration or whatever it is,
boom.

636
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:18.120
All of a sudden there is,
well there you did awesome stories.

637
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.920
<v 3>You know,
they're all our stories.</v>

638
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.480
And that's what I think the best part is that they're,
they're true.
You know,

639
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.650
it's,
it's not like I feel like I'm playing some,
I'm acting,
you know,
and that,

640
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:29.460
and that's what's,

641
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.700
that's a nice part about playing music as opposed to when I was an actress,

642
00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:37.180
is that like,
this is mine in hours.
Well,
there's a deadness to something.

643
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.460
Like there's beautiful

644
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.190
<v 1>songs that other people have written and then people will,</v>

645
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.030
will sing them and it's,
it's beautiful.
But there's a difference.

646
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.440
There's a big difference between someone who wrote the song and is singing the

647
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:53.160
song and someone who is seeing the song that somebody just sold them or

648
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:55.410
somebody's,
you know,
got them to sing.
There's a,

649
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:57.210
there's a difference is a disconnect.

650
00:35:57.211 --> 00:35:59.970
There's something that happens in any form of art,

651
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.380
whether it's great acting or great singing,
songwriting or,

652
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.690
or great literature.
Like what there's,
there's,

653
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.050
when someone fucking just nails it and when they nail it,

654
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:13.740
they're completely tuned into it.
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,
it's not just,

655
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.700
I'm going to sing this song with this weird gay guy wrote.

656
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:21.690
He's really good at it.
You know,
he sells them,
but they go and they,
they make it,

657
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:23.850
cause he's always a cool gay guys,
like on top of Shit.

658
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.870
Those lot of those songwriter guys.
But you know,
you know what I mean?

659
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:29.130
I mean there's like a disconnect.

660
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:31.380
There's a disconnect between the work and even if you feel it,

661
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:34.950
even if it's beautiful,
you know,
there's,
it's not quite the same.

662
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.870
But I do think there's something appealing about having just a song that's good

663
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:43.770
enough that it can be universally applicable.
You know what I mean?
And then,

664
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:46.770
and then someone who has a beautiful instrument and a beautiful expression.

665
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.000
I completely agree.
I know what you're saying.
I completely agree.
I,
I think both,

666
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.640
you know what I'm saying?
I think the tributes and covers are,

667
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.120
or do you know that little kid,
you remember that little kid?

668
00:36:57.121 --> 00:37:01.620
There was a video and he got on Ellen and he was,
uh,
he was singing uh,
um,

669
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.520
a lady Gaga Song.
What's the kids name?
Song.

670
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.770
And I know we've talked about it so many times.
I know.

671
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.370
Do you know the kid I'm talking about?
Either way please.
You gotta pee.

672
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.600
I gotta get some more
questions.

673
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.070
He's singing that Papa Razzi song and it's a cover,
but it's,
you know,

674
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:24.240
it's an 11 year old kid and it's fucking brilliant.
It's really brilliant.

675
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:28.170
And in that case,
yeah,
yeah,
he's tapping in.
Even if he's not,

676
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.940
he didn't write the song again.
It's like you believe it.

677
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.680
If it's true to somebody cause I have,

678
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.800
I think some songs that Ben wrote and if they don't,
if I,

679
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.330
if it doesn't resonate with me in a,
in a place that I can,

680
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:47.130
well I think this kid who was singing this song clearly was not believing the

681
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:47.964
lyrics,

682
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.240
but what these lyrics represented to him was real like personal emotional

683
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:59.040
feelings because it's not what he knows about smoking cigarettes and the

684
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:02.960
Paparazzi and all this nonsense.
He's not resonating with the actual song.

685
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.420
Maybe he's connecting to the idea of this woman,

686
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:09.420
Lady Gaga who's going through this and he's channeling himself through her,

687
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.660
but most likely he's just trying to show how emotional and conflicted he is in

688
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:19.880
his,
his expression and it just so powerful that you,
you know,
it,

689
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:24.540
it vibes with the actual song that makes no sense coming from an 11 year old

690
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:26.760
boy.
But when,

691
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.940
I love that that that kid did that,

692
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:33.260
but if he was 40 I wouldn't like it as much as look creepy.

693
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.010
Where's your own shit to capitalize on the now

694
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:42.030
<v 3>not what I'm saying.
You're already peaking kid.
No,</v>

695
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.480
<v 4>that's going to suck.
When you write your own shit and you,</v>

696
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.250
you sing your own shit.
To me it's,
it's,
I feel like more connected to it,

697
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.800
you know.
I'll second that.

698
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.100
That's why you guys are bad ass man.

699
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.430
I totally both.

700
00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.720
Brian doesn't even like her music with words.
All Brian likes is like,
oh Whoa,

701
00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:07.340
whoa,
whoa,
wait,
got a house music band music.

702
00:39:07.341 --> 00:39:11.150
I think I like all the eight bit.
Sounds a that's cool.
Once in a while.

703
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.300
Are you a jam band Kinda Guy?
I grew up hippie.

704
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.150
We more by you nailed him.
He's good.
Piss up a rope.

705
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.220
Yeah.
It's like what is that the greatest songs ever.

706
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.800
Do you know about the Wean doing the pizza hut commercial?

707
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.980
Hold up just saying piss up a rope and one of the what song called Piss up a

708
00:39:27.981 --> 00:39:30.530
rope by Wayne.
We did a whole hour songs ever.
It,

709
00:39:30.531 --> 00:39:34.130
we did a whole album where it's like old school country sounds so,

710
00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:36.680
so the best thing about Wayne is like every single one of their songs sounds

711
00:39:36.681 --> 00:39:40.340
like a different band.
Hold on,
shut up.
I never heard this piss up a rope.

712
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.900
Wean lets you play their shit on the Internet.

713
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.960
That's one of the coolest things about all right.
I hope so.
No they do.

714
00:39:44.961 --> 00:39:45.411
That's their,

715
00:39:45.411 --> 00:39:49.280
they're really like open about like you playing shit on the Internet and the use

716
00:39:49.281 --> 00:39:51.450
of Shit.
I love that.
You know,

717
00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:54.860
a certain point in time people have to realize that there's no way you're going

718
00:39:54.861 --> 00:39:58.940
to ever control how many people are downloading your shits and possible.

719
00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:04.150
But you can control what you do and if you could buy it and then people buy it,

720
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.470
borrow while she watches.

721
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.520
<v 5>Do you ever wonder what it's like to be me?</v>

722
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.180
No smokes

723
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.950
and salts folks breaking my back.
You in the best that I came,

724
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.170
Scott Board.

725
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.730
So in the fucking room,
his,
oh wait,

726
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.760
I got to tell you about the

727
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:41.550
<v 3>pizza hut story because they were commissioned to write a song for Pizza Hut and</v>

728
00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:43.860
it was like Wayne was.
Wayne was and they apparently,

729
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:48.090
and God if I say this incorrectly,
I apologize,
but they basically,
they,

730
00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:51.060
they wrote this tune and the Ab is on Youtube.

731
00:40:51.061 --> 00:40:52.320
So you could find this if you want it to,

732
00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.410
but basically they wrote this too and it was like where the cheese go

733
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.530
kill zone kind of like fold up beside,
it's supposed to be like,

734
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.200
so they write and then they wrote this brilliant song,
right?

735
00:41:04.201 --> 00:41:07.080
It's like witty and they produce it and it sounds great.

736
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.440
It's all about this like fold over Stromboli cal zone type thing.

737
00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.550
It's like where the cheese go,
where the cheese go and pizza hut was like,
Hey,

738
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.300
can you make it a little more ridiculous?
And so they,
they,
you know,

739
00:41:18.301 --> 00:41:22.770
basically they insulted the band and the band came back with the same song every

740
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.260
verbatim except for where the motherfucking cheese.

741
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.020
So great.
It's so,
it's so brilliant.
Obviously it was never placed here.

742
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:33.980
It is on a commercial.
That's hilarious.
Oh you've got

743
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.870
<v 4>it.
Oh that's hilarious.</v>

744
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:43.060
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

745
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.710
that's so ridiculous.

746
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.510
<v 4>Oh my God.
That's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen.
Great.</v>

747
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.310
They used to be my ringtone back in the day.
Oh Brian's.

748
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:05.810
You always get the most past your shit.

749
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.020
If you ever looking for something bizarre.
If you hear a rumor,

750
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:11.810
a whiff of something in the air,
so it's true contact Brian.

751
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.220
Brian's got the inside word on all nerd shit.
He'll,

752
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.960
he'll let you know immediately.
What the fuck is up?
Cheese go.
I Dunno.

753
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.720
Yeah,
I love,
I love bands that do that.

754
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.510
Put all their shit out there.
I like the Radiohead sells all their shit online.

755
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.570
I think that's a future,
right?
Yeah.
It's a matter of time.

756
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.640
We talked about all the time like this,
this,
uh,

757
00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.390
an APP stitcher that were available on you.
Get your car now.
Oh,

758
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:42.980
someone's phone's still sing gay songs.
I'm like,
God,
this time.
What is this?

759
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.320
Can we hear that ringtone?

760
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.150
What is that little bow with the two different ones for different people call

761
00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:53.610
you.
You only have one ring tone.
Oh,

762
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.890
our manager,
your manager talking about the Christmas song on Spotify.

763
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.210
It's way past Christmas.
Yeah.
What's your

764
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.300
drop that guy [inaudible] joking.

765
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:10.461
Rough.
Listen,

766
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.930
there's a lot of things I say when people think I'm really being serious.
He's,

767
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.860
there's an instant that you have when you're a comedian to say the worst shit

768
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:19.280
possible all the time and you try to fight it as much as possible.

769
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.320
When when someone fucks up your like firearm,
firearm,

770
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.180
I don't really mean that dude,
totally don't mean that,
but tell him to relax,

771
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:29.090
but the fucking Christmas Song,
Jesus Christ,

772
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.840
just get the word out there about problems in the future with him.
Joke,

773
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:36.920
may we contact you for it all costs from me directly.

774
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.570
I'll take care of it.
She,
you know,
no one can ever tell you what to do.

775
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.100
If they do,
it won't work.

776
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.900
You know the only thing you can do that's good is put yourself out there,

777
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.660
put your music out there and keep going.
All that other stuff.

778
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.660
Let them deal with it.
Publicity stuff and nonsense,
but dominant.

779
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.360
Have to tell you what to do.
You know that's the bottom line.

780
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:59.290
There's a lot of prognosticators from the outside and they'll sit back and they

781
00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:03.830
go,
what you need to do is,
have you ever think
you might be holding it back

782
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.930
is ever anyone ever say that?
Ben,

783
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:12.800
if he just a lot of crap about his hair.
Cut your hair,

784
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.960
but the ladies was talking about the ladies,

785
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.500
then you were a talented artist.

786
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.670
It would be a shame if you got as far as you got and then suddenly it all falls

787
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:26.780
apart because if you look

788
00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:35.460
just like that,
I'm not saying interesting to set Jewish.
No,

789
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:39.030
but Suzanne,
she is right now did for my love of Jewish people.

790
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:41.960
I must immediately change my accent.
I appreciate that.
Yes.

791
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.260
I got this wired back,
man.
I got this game.

792
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.890
I know the game was vaguely African
hair.

793
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.070
We're going to cut your hand night five years from now.

794
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:57.120
You'll do whatever the fuck you want,
man.
What y'all call him?

795
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:02.410
This is what you want,
right?
Lifts.
Everyone wears lifts.
Yeah,
come on back.

796
00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:04.980
I got up,
I got him.
I got the socks stuffed in my pants and everything.

797
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.790
Ain't no preaching.
Have you have,

798
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.970
has anyone ever given you any anal bleachings are good.
Move to don.
Hey.

799
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.460
Oh No.
Oh no kidding.

800
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.620
By the,
by the,
by so kidding.
The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

801
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:26.450
Ladies and gentlemen,
how dare you make me go there.

802
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.630
Don't challenge me.

803
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.430
I don't remember what we're even talking about now at this one or reason out of

804
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:34.980
your asshole.
That's not what we're talking about.
I remember that.

805
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.650
<v 3>It's sailor Jerry.
It's his right.</v>

806
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.990
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I just feel like Jerry,</v>

807
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.880
has anybody ever given you any preposterous advice as far as look or image or

808
00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.610
yes.
Please tell me.
Suzanne,
what have they done to you?

809
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:52.210
Those fucks motivators.
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna name names.
Don't,
don't do it.

810
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.083
You don't have to do that.

811
00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.310
<v 3>Told once to,
um,</v>

812
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.980
<v 4>well,
you know what?
No,
I can't go for and then it's too late now.
It's too late.</v>

813
00:45:59.981 --> 00:46:03.340
I got your back.
She was like,
funny.
So like basically,
you know,

814
00:46:03.341 --> 00:46:04.620
like I ever mentioned

815
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.530
<v 3>earlier that like,
you know,
our band,</v>

816
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.910
we're at this level where we write together and we,

817
00:46:09.911 --> 00:46:13.290
we do like your rain making arrangements with music and it's,

818
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.060
it's really fulfilling and rewarding and,

819
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:19.440
and we're watching it do all these cool things.
I'm like,
be on your show.

820
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:20.830
Holy Shit.
Balls.
Oh.

821
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:25.410
But I was told a few years back to when I was just starting out and trying to

822
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:27.910
figure out how to do things that,
um,

823
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:33.380
I should work on being attractive and funny and a good performer and,

824
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:40.140
and not write songs and let my band mate write the songs and wow.
And I was like,

825
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:42.390
you,
you want me to do what?
It's like,

826
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.760
<v 4>oh,
well this,
the guy was trying to fucking not,
and I hope to God not because</v>

827
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.680
I just threw a lot of women.

828
00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:54.190
Don't realize how many guys were interacting with them on a fucking,

829
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.043
<v 3>no,</v>

830
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.640
<v 4>I just wanted to control thing.
I'm gonna Hook you up.</v>

831
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.770
I'm gonna help you out here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you got?

832
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.960
<v 3>Oh,
he's,
he's way older than 50</v>

833
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:09.510
<v 4>probably.
Yeah.
Yeah.
15 in your eyes,
in your eyes.</v>

834
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:14.070
He's out of the game and his eyes.
He's a polite.
Yeah.
Oh Gosh.
Yes.
And,

835
00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.210
and he knows,
he knows he can't fuck you.
He knows he can't fuck you.

836
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.560
He knows you're not attracted to him.

837
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.770
But his instincts will always be to be little and to try to in some way to find

838
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:29.990
something wrong with you instead of like the answer representation or

839
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.040
<v 0>a representative rather have an artist like the way you should be looking at it.</v>

840
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:37.090
And it's like trying somehow or another to to be an aid to build them up.

841
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:39.670
Not to like shoot them down and correct this or change that,

842
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.550
but to just pump up all the good stuff.
Like you know,
like,

843
00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.380
like look at them as you know,

844
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:47.170
like you're in some sort of a partnership with them and the more you can rise

845
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:48.940
them up,
the better it would be for everybody.

846
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:52.750
So it should all be positive and I'll be like reinforcing it and honest and

847
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:55.360
everything but,
but still positive.
So when a guy,

848
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.250
he's a representative kind of like shits,

849
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.920
I knew a little bit like that and tries to change what he's selling and change

850
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.350
who you are.
I always think he wants to fuck.
Yeah,

851
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.070
<v 4>but you know,
what will the power thing regardless,</v>

852
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.130
regardless if that is true or not.
Listen to me.
Stop it.
Stop it.

853
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:11.940
Stop with the modesty.
Don't even talk right now.
I'm serious.
Listen,

854
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.910
you are very pretty girl.
Very.
You're very pretty girl.
You know that.

855
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:17.320
You know the end.
You also talented.

856
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.350
So for anybody gets in a position where they're selling something,

857
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:23.500
most of them are fucks.
Most of them,
like there's a lot of good,

858
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.730
<v 0>great agents and great,
great managers and great representatives of artists.</v>

859
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.170
I love my manager to death.

860
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:31.330
I've had the same manager since I was an open mic comedian.

861
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.680
<v 4>I love him to death.
We also love you,
Jeffrey.</v>

862
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.950
Sorry about the [inaudible] name is Jeffrey too.
Oh my God,
that's crazy.
Oh,

863
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.470
his name is Jeff Susman.
My manager's name.
No bullshit.
What?

864
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:46.250
That's not our it guy's last name.
But go on the bottom line is,
bottom line is,

865
00:48:46.251 --> 00:48:48.710
I'm trying to tell you,
this guy was trying to fuck you.
Well,

866
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.680
we're trying to help you out,
but I think it was more powerful.

867
00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.600
I think it was the power for,
I think you're right.
It's not just that it's be,

868
00:48:55.610 --> 00:49:00.100
it's because he's beyond the possibility of being sexually attractive to you as

869
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.480
well.
So because of that it's gotta be the power.
Fuck.

870
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.660
I would really would like the regular thought process makes me really

871
00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:08.480
uncomfortable because I know is that disturbing.
But I will tell you this,

872
00:49:08.481 --> 00:49:13.481
that that those things like when you know I was like 22 and I needed a change.

873
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.180
You know,

874
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.390
you need champions when you're just getting started and you're kind of like

875
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.540
hoping that you do a good job and then of course a person that you're looking up

876
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:23.650
to.
You said some bullshit like that to you.
Yes.
I think that in the,

877
00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:27.270
in the long run those things are a good thing because you can't,

878
00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.490
you get over it and then you get better,
you know,
and,

879
00:49:29.491 --> 00:49:31.130
and those things just kind of bounce right off

880
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.590
<v 0>you.
Listen,
there's nothing wrong with who you are ever.</v>

881
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:40.150
So if,
if you're,
if you're a person and you like this,

882
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:43.060
you like country music,
you like dressing like this,

883
00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:47.980
whatever the fuck you like,
whatever,
whatever your trying to suck in your jeans,

884
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.820
whatever it is.
That should be what you gravitate towards one time.

885
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.990
And as soon as someone comes along and is like,
listen dude,
you know,
you're,

886
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:59.590
you're going to have to like change this and change that.
And,
and when,

887
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.370
whenever someone tries to deviate you off of who you are naturally instead of

888
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:06.940
just trying to enhance you,
they're not doing it.
They're not helping you out,
man.

889
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.321
<v 4>No,</v>

890
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:12.321
but I think that's the general attitude and approach in the show business and

891
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:13.320
maybe our businesses,

892
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.910
I don't know how to justify their mean is they want to add some ingredients to

893
00:50:16.911 --> 00:50:19.920
the soup.
Yeah.
Oh Man.
That fucking kid could get nowhere.

894
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.350
You're this mustache train the fucking beer thing going on.

895
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:27.080
You don't make my beard.
I love it.
I love it.
Don't get me wrong in Madison time.

896
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.250
Sometimes

897
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.630
<v 3>you have to take that hit and,
and know that you're smarter than that person and,</v>

898
00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.600
and keep going,
you know,
and,
and use them.
Or someone

899
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.380
<v 1>could actually give you good advice.
That's the truth.
That's the craziest thing.</v>

900
00:50:40.381 --> 00:50:44.280
So we could actually give you the,
you know,
it's rare,
but then again,

901
00:50:44.281 --> 00:50:48.690
they shouldn't be,
it shouldn't be douchey about it.
Yeah.
Idiots.

902
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.840
But,

903
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.430
but the idea that men and men always want women to dress like a certain life.

904
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:55.070
Maybe if you dressed a little bit sexier,

905
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.850
<v 3>can you be more of a C Cup?
That's impossible.</v>

906
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.030
We need bigger Erin Areola is,

907
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:04.970
can you get a tattoo around your area that looks like a regular guy?

908
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.430
I had a nickel for every time.
Okay.

909
00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.130
<v 1>I worked with this check for a cold check,</v>

910
00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:10.230
but I won't say her name out of respect because I don't know if she wants people

911
00:51:10.231 --> 00:51:14.160
to know about this,
but she had cutlass these,
these rubber cutlets in your Bra.

912
00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:19.250
They're like,
they're like a temporary fake boob.
They,
they look like chicken.

913
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:24.570
A big slab of a rubber chicken and you stuff your tests with them.

914
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.450
It's used to be at somewhere on another,
like it's acceptable.

915
00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:31.760
Whereas like tissue papers,
ridiculous.
But he's a cop had to wear four.

916
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.700
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean I used to,
I used to do some modeling back in the day.</v>

917
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:42.520
<v 4>Oh Shit.
What's up?
Well,
it was like,
it was just catalogs or basketball.</v>

918
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.970
Ramzan the old bag over there.

919
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.400
<v 1>Somebody did some modeling.
Now we understand why you had the shady manager.</v>

920
00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:03.330
I understand you were in transition.
No big deal.
Listen,

921
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.190
I was a paper boy when I was young.
It's cool.
Great choice for this.

922
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.150
That's not true.
Dare you.
How dare you play stupid.

923
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.260
<v 3>Um,
zoo lander.
We're playing south by southwest and um,</v>

924
00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:21.230
we're apparently because you know when,
when you,
when you play certain shows,

925
00:52:21.231 --> 00:52:24.820
they give you things like clothes or fry boots and we,

926
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.860
we got offered this position where they're like,
Hey,

927
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:30.080
will you guys play this show?
We'll give you free clothes,

928
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.640
but you have to rock walk on a runway.
And I mean,

929
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.760
this was a case.
I really just,
I,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
that's,

930
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.680
you just kind of walked by and be like,
hey,

931
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:41.670
check out this fucking Jean jacket right now.

932
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:47.480
But I'm more excited for Ben to do it because I think that like from a zoo

933
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:49.870
lander standpoint,
it's just going to be

934
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.360
<v 4>really truly Danny's drop.</v>

935
00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:58.080
We'll be updating your Facebook profile period,
blood

936
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.420
model.
I want to see runway model.
I've done it.
I know I'm not gonna lie

937
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.560
<v 3>together.
And the photographer said to Ben,</v>

938
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.530
you have the most beautiful Jesus' eyes I've ever seen.

939
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:15.410
And she just referred to him for the rest of the day.
Is Jesus' eyes taken out?

940
00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.253
Ladies?

941
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.920
<v 4>What'd that feel like?
Did you feel like a lot of weight was on your shoulders?</v>

942
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:24.420
Just a lot of responsibility.
Humankind was that,

943
00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:25.980
but I was carrying someone and the only

944
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.280
<v 1>two footprints in the sand,
could you imagine if I pulled her aside</v>

945
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.180
and that was going to say,
could you imagine if you pulled her aside and say,

946
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:40.020
listen,
I want you to keep a secret.
I can't do that.

947
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:44.220
I'm not comfortable with that.
Jesus.
I am the Lord and I'm back.

948
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.020
I am not humorless.
I'm not humorous.
I am a man and I also am the Holy Spirit.

949
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:53.560
Let's do modeling.
Tell no one.
I gotta walk the Walk My,

950
00:53:53.561 --> 00:53:57.120
they're called [inaudible] about to call me.
Give you those chicken cutlets.

951
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:00.210
It wouldn't be that hard,
man.
You know what you would do.
You would,
you know,

952
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:03.960
even if you thought that it was hard to pitch,
you know,
say,
listen,
I'm not Jesus,

953
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:08.610
but I'm the new guy.
His name is Ben.
It's the new Messiah.
Jesus.

954
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:10.770
Before there was a cheeses,
I mean,
nobody knew what the fuck are you,
you know,

955
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:14.550
you couldn't say before Jesus's birth,
you can't,
couldn't say praise Jesus.

956
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.740
People go,
what the fuck are you talking about?
You know,
why could,

957
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:21.300
Jesus didn't exist yet,
but Ben's,
he like praise heroines here.
It's Ben now Ben,

958
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.130
and that will be the new thing.
It'd be a praise band.

959
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.110
There's a lot of bands out there,
Joe.
There's a lot of bands,
but not,

960
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.660
there's a lot of,
hey,
Suze is out there too,
but they escaped by this.
She,
man,

961
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.960
you got to tell you have pitched it.
You got to start your own call.

962
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.850
Do you have any land anywhere in the middle of nowhere?
I don't,

963
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:39.150
but what I'm looking for a plot.
Listen,
how much beard can you actually grow?

964
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.610
Can we be real?
Are you trimming that?

965
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.790
This is kind of all I got to be a little catchy.

966
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:51.030
Yes.
Good call.
What I would like would,
I would like if you comfortable,

967
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.610
it's just something that looks like a little unkempt.

968
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.660
Something that goes over the lips.
Yeah.

969
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.600
In the mouth where you really don't have an ego.

970
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.320
You know the shower for a couple of days,
you know you want to be hygienic,

971
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:05.120
but you want,
you want to not give a fuck.
Okay.
We don't want to stink positive.

972
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.880
You don't want to turn into a negative,
but uh,
you know,
I don't give a fuck.

973
00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:11.550
Might be a positive.
That's all I'm saying.
Okay.
I will follow this path.

974
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:15.810
Imagine if you were like an agent for cult members.
Refer for cult leaders.
Like,

975
00:55:15.811 --> 00:55:19.290
listen,
I think we're about about to get,
get busy with this cult,

976
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.310
but what I need from you is more beard.
Got To work on our image.

977
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:25.140
You got to work at,
I mean,

978
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:29.700
really we're lucky that show Biz people don't get involved in colt making

979
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.700
because of cult man.
He really was like,
fuck yeah.

980
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.160
Could you imagine if Alec Baldwin wanted to start his own cult?

981
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:39.540
They'd be a lot of menopausal women.
There's the lining in the Alec Baldwin cult,

982
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:44.100
right.
Just a woman who wants him to yell at her and then hug or just some,

983
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.520
some weird situation because

984
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.240
it is very difficult sometimes

985
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.540
while I'm drunk.
Yeah.
I'm getting there a little bit.
This is pretty quick.

986
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.240
My face is so red right now.

987
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:09.910
There's like some sort of heat or Roy bailed and left us with,

988
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:15.810
this is the first show I've done since I shaved my head
here.

989
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:21.070
They wanted me to ask you why you shaved your head.
Is it done?

990
00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.570
Yeah,
it seems like,
it seems like there's no video.

991
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.650
I've gotten several.
Well the audio seems to be going though.

992
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:32.280
Let me see if the audience gone.
Hurricane is Yadi Rolling.
Yeah.

993
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.740
<v 4>I don't know.
Um,
but the walls are purple.</v>

994
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:39.520
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck happened.
Let me call Brian Real quick.</v>

995
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.950
<v 7>Suzanne is wearing a lacy type shirt.
Joe Shaved his head.</v>

996
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.770
I'm holding a terra Patrick book.

997
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:51.250
I could read a random paragraph from it if you'd like.

998
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.640
Our first stop was a sleazy lingerie store in Hollywood.
Well,

999
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:56.410
you read and Tera Patrick's biography.

1000
00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:01.370
<v 1>Why do I have my pants on the point?
Let's,
let's go back to one.</v>

1001
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.330
Let me call Brian and make sure that this is all really going down because I

1002
00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:08.660
feel it's up.
Jeff,
it says of all the people online,
if you're,

1003
00:57:08.661 --> 00:57:11.990
if you're watching online,
it says that it's on,
but it doesn't seem to be on.

1004
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.120
<v 4>Okay.
Okay.
So we'll call them dry right now.</v>

1005
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.640
<v 1>I'll continue to read.
So what did someone have a question?
What was the question?</v>

1006
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.420
Somebody asked me.
They said ask Joe why he shaved his head.
I tapped out,

1007
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.900
tapped out to hair loss tabs.
There's a certain point in time

1008
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.370
I didn't even tap out,
but I do a whole bit about America.

1009
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:33.220
I cheated before tapped out.
Where did he go?

1010
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.540
My fucking freak employee has vanished.
Hey Brian is the feeds down man,

1011
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:41.440
people are complaining crazy.
There's nothing on c c u stream black.

1012
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.103
<v 4>Oh,</v>

1013
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:47.780
<v 1>oh boy.
Anyway,
um,
my hair was gross.
Got Tired of dealing with it so I shaved it.</v>

1014
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:50.750
Yeah,
Go pee now cause I got to go to,
I've been thinking about it.

1015
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.090
Me and Betty going to get to know each other.
I don't wait.
Oh God,
yes.

1016
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:57.690
I'm after you though.
So don't do you have a knife in your pocket?
I do.

1017
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:01.460
Oh my God,
you got to give me an up top.
I like how you said her name on it.

1018
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:03.890
I like how your rocket,
she gets up.
I'm like,

1019
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:08.000
does that a fucking knife is a really bad eh?

1020
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.820
I like it.
A of gate.

1021
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.930
<v 7>It did that last time Joe.</v>

1022
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.720
Like it just like in the middle of recording it just stopped.
Is it?

1023
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.030
It doesn't read though,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have it saved on my desktop.

1024
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.060
But it doesn't say on here.

1025
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.460
<v 1>Yeah,
I dunno what's so could we reboot it?
What do we got to do?
I think it's,</v>

1026
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:26.920
we're working right now,
but it doesn't seem to be working on this side Bro,

1027
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.730
because I turned the volume on some,
it's not odd man.

1028
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.500
Should I read more terror Patrick?
Yeah man.
Oh,
we're back.
It is back now.

1029
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.100
It is back now.
Okay.
Tony.
Leah became my next thing.
You know,

1030
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.410
when we have such a fabulous show,

1031
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.350
we have so many people that are trying to watch it at the same time and

1032
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:47.060
sometimes shit goes wrong.
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's not perfected.

1033
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.150
<v 7>It would always be,
it's always going to be on your Vimeo.</v>

1034
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:53.590
So anytime like this happens,
always just go to your website,
Joe rogan.net.

1035
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:57.490
<v 1>Yeah.
And folks,
you should also know that folks that are watching this,
um,</v>

1036
00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.700
or rather listening to this,
if you ever wanted to watch,

1037
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.640
especially the ones that we do at the ice house and it's really pretty bad ass.

1038
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:07.780
We have a whole multi camera setup and there's a switcher and it's like a

1039
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.200
halfassed cable access TV show,
but you can watch it.

1040
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:13.930
You could watch it on Vimeo and people are actually watching.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1041
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:18.600
At least 2000 people right now are watching this too.
Right now it's 2082,
uh,

1042
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.100
live bus a lot of people,
but that's a small amount.
Majority of

1043
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.800
<v 0>them or listening to it and it'd be three format.
The,
um,
the podcast,</v>

1044
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:29.690
the video podcast market is like a tiny fraction of what it is for the audio

1045
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.920
podcast market.
People want to listen to the jam when their car in traffic,

1046
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:37.100
you know,
couple of years though.
I think that will change.
Do you think so?

1047
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:40.040
Because I think there's always going to be times where you're commuting and

1048
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:43.160
that's why people love audio.
And that's where we come in and commuting.

1049
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.180
We come in while people are driving,
like,
you know,
there's,
there's a,

1050
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:50.450
there's sort of a,
um,
a place for all sorts of different types of entertainment.

1051
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.290
You know,
you want undivided attention when you watch a movie,
but with a podcast,

1052
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:57.980
we like travel with people were on planes with people right now.

1053
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.500
Right now we're in cars with people,
you know,
we're,

1054
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:03.950
we're hiking with people were at the gym with people,
you know,
it's,
it's a weird,

1055
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:06.800
sort of a form of entertainment.
So it's,
uh,
you know,

1056
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.500
so the visual aspect is this tiny fraction.

1057
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:13.040
It's about 500,000 people in it was amazing.
Yeah.
Well,

1058
01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:16.270
it started out with just a laptop and like we had a Webcam.

1059
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.410
We were just answering Twitter questions.
I don't know what happened,
but,

1060
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.510
but now it's the most fun thing I've ever done.
And you know,

1061
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:26.030
all the TV Shit I've ever done.
It's all fun.

1062
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:29.690
But this is the only thing that you could do whatever you do,
anything.
You know,

1063
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.660
we have you guys on.
Yeah,
come on.
We gotta play music.

1064
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.610
Do you want to tune your shit?
I'm going to take a leak.

1065
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.650
So talk amongst yourselves or Brian,

1066
01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.820

I'll be right back.

1067
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:43.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll talk to you while they pay,
but Brian,

1068
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:44.000

1087
01:01:56.271 --> 01:01:59.290
It just discussing how we're drunk right now.
Yeah.

1088
01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:05.120
Oh Shit.
Are there any requests we could just play?
Yeah.

1089
01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:10.200
Do you know any krabby patty songs?
Yes,
I do actually.
Okay,
great.

1090
01:02:10.201 --> 01:02:14.000
Cause I want to hear a crappy Chinese art,
but that's a real song.

1091
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:18.570
Do you know that?
Krabby Patty.
Oh yeah.

Yeah.
That's cool.
Brian Wilson was always on that.</v>

1094
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.410
You know about sponge Bob.
Do you have kids?
I know I smoke a lot of wheat.

1095
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.630
Oh.
And he's gonna look,

1096
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.830
Andy Paley come on the best day ever.

1097
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:38.390
A friend who wrote all the spongebob songs,
Andy Paley.
Um,

1098
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.800
we went to his wedding a few years back in Kansas where he got married in Kansas

1099
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:47.880
and at his wedding he,
we perform some spongebob songs.
Oh,
that's awesome.

1100
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:49.560
It was a blast.
Tom Kenny,

1101
01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.320
the guy who does the voice of Spongebob was right there and perform.

1102
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.200
Can you stand up comic?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the voice of Spongebob.
Oh,
you're rolling?

1103
01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:00.990
Yeah.
Do you guys watch adventure time?

1104
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:04.960
Awesome.
Have you ever heard,
seen him?
You will love adventure time.
Okay.

1105
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.320
It's on the cartoon network.
You guys get on iTunes.

1106
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:10.620
It's adventure times by Penelton ward in it's,
it's crack.

1107
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.620
You will watch a million.
They talk about DMT.
They've,

1108
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.800
it's just like an adult cartoon for kids.
It's great.

1109
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.070
I don't understand.
Hey Brian,

1110
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:22.770
do you want me to adjust any of these microphones via,
no,

1111
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.560
that's good cause I was just going to do one of these.
Yeah,
that's fine.

1112
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.260
I just want to point out that you guys were the first band that we've ever had

1113
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:33.210
perform all those podcasts.
Honor.
Oh please.
It's an honor for us.
This is solving,

1114
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.850
so if you have any other bands on the show,

1115
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:39.040
can we put them through some sort of level of hazing?
Yes,

1116
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.240
because that would be really fun.
You can be on the board whenever you want.

1117
01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:46.590
The only one who has a grandfather clause though was Everlast because he already

1118
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:49.890
talked about it.
He wants to come on and do it.
Okay,
fair enough.
Fair enough.

1119
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.260
We don't want to fuck with that guy and he's a great guy.

1120
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:56.490
I let it slide last shout and shout out the dead mouse.

1121
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:03.170
Do you want to shout out to be real to maybe real after we did the last podcast,

1122
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:06.220
be real.
Wants to do a bunch of them.
We're going to do a back and forth.
Right?

1123
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.710
We're going to do them with their studio and simulcasts his,
his,
his dream.

1124
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.400
My use trim.
Same time.
Right.
We're gonna do all that.
So we're going to,

1125
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.400
we're going to do that real soon.
Maybe I could just have a tiny fucked yes son.

1126
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:24.150
Oh,
I'm driving back to,

1127
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:27.980
that's cool.
I know.
I'm a very capable drivers.
Jesus Christ.

1128
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.360
Is this going to be filmed or something?

1129
01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:33.930
Does this mean I can't run for public office?
No,
it's,
it's just online right now.

1130
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:35.363
Don't worry about it.

1131
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.270
That's the shit that gave Neil Armstrong when they made them fake the moon

1132
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.950
landings.
What?
I'm

1133
01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:46.520

1136
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.600
We're going sing a tune called back to you that we have not yet recorded play.

1137
01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:56.320
Right.

1138
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.960
That's how you're going to play in after you've not yet recorded back to you.

1139
01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:01.930
There's a new song we never know.
No,
it's been around for a while.

1140
01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.020
We just never recorded it.

1141
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.323
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1142

Swept up.

1158
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:16.220

01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:22.350
So important sometimes for shit to go wrong.
So,

1161
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.960
so important sometimes for shit to go wrong.
Come on man.
That was beautiful.

1162
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:30.000
It was amazing.
God Damn,
that was awesome.
Thank you.

1163
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:33.440
You guys are a fucking potent combination man.
I've heard that song.

1164
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.590
That song has never been released.
It's not an anything.
Is it online anywhere?

1165
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.370
I it.
Well there's that.
There's that,
um,

1166
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:44.030
<v 3>that as quarter house video.
That's what we haven't done.</v>

1167
01:08:44.031 --> 01:08:45.290
Like an audio recording of it yet.

1168
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.200
<v 1>No.
Bleeds it in that show that you came,</v>

1169
01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.320
but I heard it before that it must be the Esquire house thing because there's

1170
01:08:50.321 --> 01:08:52.000
two songs on the Esquire house thing.
Right?

1171
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:54.250
That's the angel of death in that one.
Yeah.

1172
01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:56.910
The Angel of death was the one who want to hear that one as well.
Oh,
definitely.

1173
01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:01.750
We'll play that for you later,
later,
later.
Make me wait for it.

1174
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.090
Not,
may I go to the bathroom please.
Oh please.
Oh,

1175
01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:10.080
do you can have ice and now we can talk about Ben wellies.
Yeah,

1176
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.900
let's talk bit more than two.
Shakespearian don't get crazy bad.

1177
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:18.760
He's going to do a dual citizen.
So I'm hoping that you guys have an unusual,

1178
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:22.550
<v 3>that's a cool little friendship,
but working sort of friendship.
Yes,</v>

1179
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.620
it is unusual.
It's your best friend.

1180
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:28.840
It's hard for a man and a woman and be friends.
It is,
but it also is,

1181
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:32.960
it's a great balance.
You know what I mean?
Yes.
If it works,
right,
yeah.

1182
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah it does.
And Yeah,
I feel really lucky because we're were like incredibly,

1183
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:40.910
like our communicative skills or just,
we're very verbal,

1184
01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:44.060
we're very honest and you know,
I think something,

1185
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.780
I think a lot of things with bands is being able to be like afraid sometimes and

1186
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:54.050
talk about it or like fucked up about something and everyone,
you know,

1187
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.230
wants any friendship.
Sure.
But this is a business too.

1188
01:09:57.231 --> 01:10:00.620
I mean it's a friendship and a business and more and more problematic.

1189
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:05.030
It totally,
and it's anyhow,
it's,
it's a lot of,
it's,
you know,

1190
01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:08.360
there's a lot of emotions woven into this business too because you're creating

1191
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:13.190
things and that there's a lot of attachment to that.
And um,
we just talk a lot,

1192
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.890
you know,

1193
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:16.830
<v 1>we're have issues.
Like we're like,
you want to pursue a song and he's like,</v>

1194
01:10:16.831 --> 01:10:18.840
I'm not really into it.
It's not working.

1195
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.160
<v 3>We,
we really are on the same page as far as like what works and what doesn't.</v>

1196
01:10:24.161 --> 01:10:25.150
And we like,

1197
01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:29.260
if there's a tune that one of us brings to the table that we're not sure about

1198
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.620
it,
we'll,
we'll give it a good try before it doesn't work.
And it's,

1199
01:10:32.621 --> 01:10:35.470
it's always like,
we just know,
you know,
we don't,

1200
01:10:35.471 --> 01:10:37.090
we don't fight about songs like that.

1201
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:40.600
<v 1>Vet Buddies would have been in bands and that always seems to be the giant</v>

1202
01:10:40.601 --> 01:10:44.770
problem is the communication between band members that jockeying for position,

1203
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.160
especially with dude's like for dudes,

1204
01:10:47.161 --> 01:10:50.950
it's like ultimately going to be some dick wave in contest between band members.

1205
01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.070
We wave our Dixon each other all the time.
What you mean my Dick in the

1206
01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.520
it's,
it's,
it's inevitable,
right?

1207
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:05.320
I mean it's,
it's a rare thing.
When I was explaining or rather was,

1208
01:11:05.321 --> 01:11:09.460
I was asking you,
what is it like to have this rare friendship you guys have?

1209
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.290
I mean it's rare that a man and a woman,

1210
01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:14.340
I mean you guys really seem like genuine friends.

1211
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:17.530
<v 0>There's not any weird creepy shit is a weird thing when you're hanging out with</v>

1212
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.790
siren noise and microphones booth.
Um,

1213
01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:23.760
you ever hang out with someone and there there's a guy and a girl and someone

1214
01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:25.830
likes someone and someone doesn't like the other person.

1215
01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:29.700
There's some weird fucking thing going on where,
you know,
for whatever reason,

1216
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:31.770
you know what I mean?
It like,
it doesn't seem like a real friendship.

1217
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.860
It's like this weird working partnership where the guy's creepy or the girls

1218
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.020
creepy or someone's creepy because always something wrong.

1219
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:40.890
But you guys both have like this,
like really liked both creepy you guys.

1220
01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:44.160
Is this easy way about you?
But I mean that,
that's,
um,

1221
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:48.330
that's a very difficult thing to accomplish in this life.
Especially young.

1222
01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:52.710
You guys are very young.
You,
you said,
what'd you say?
28?
26.
And how old are you?

1223
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:57.230
27.
I'm the one in the late twenties older woman.
I mean,
that's,
you know,

1224
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.690
you're really young.
I mean,
to have your shit together this well,
you know,

1225
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.780
and to be,
uh,
to be buddies like this and so collaborative,
you know,

1226
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:06.860
without any weird ego shit that says a lot about the both of you.

1227
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.840
<v 2>I mean,
that's been a big part of everything we've done.</v>

1228
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:12.450
When she was talking earlier about what someone had said to her,
you know,

1229
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:15.510
similar experiences,
not obviously,
not with the same adjectives.

1230
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:20.070
No one was pushing me to be like the attractive one.
But,
uh,
you know,
there's,

1231
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.070
there's a lot of getting over ego in this situation,

1232
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:26.160
which I think is only served both of us,
you know what I mean?
Like,
uh,

1233
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.590
just as much as that type of thing has happened to her.
You know,
I,

1234
01:12:30.591 --> 01:12:33.510
I tend to fade into the background where,
you know,
it sends a beautiful woman,

1235
01:12:33.511 --> 01:12:35.940
she's singing,
she's a front person,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.

1236
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:38.670
And you know,
being able to be comfortable,
not,

1237
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.380
not feeling threatened that no one gives a shit about what I'm doing or cares,

1238
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.660
you know,

1239
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.840
knows what I'm doing in the band has been something that has been great for me.

1240
01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:49.470
I feel like actually to get over that,
you know what I mean?
And not really,

1241
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.000
you know,
be too invested in what people think they understand about

1242
01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.770
<v 0>our relationship or anything like that.
This is going to end horribly wrong.</v>

1243
01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.420
Oh boy.
She's going to completely fall apart at a certain point in time with,
no,

1244
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.413
I'm terrified.

1245
01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:05.530
But you guys are the perfect little collaborative sort of a situation.
I mean,

1246
01:13:05.531 --> 01:13:08.680
it really is beautiful.
You know,
when,
when,
when,

1247
01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:12.370
when it sinks and it works,
you know,
it's obvious in what you produce,

1248
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.180
what you're producing.
So,
so fascinating.
It was really compelling stuff.

1249
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.080
It's really,

1250
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.890
<v 3>thank you.
Well,
thank you.
And you know,</v>

1251
01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:22.130
something that's like really important to us is um,

1252
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.920
comedy and having fun and like,

1253
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:29.000
there's a lot of serious elements to what we're doing because we want it so

1254
01:13:29.001 --> 01:13:33.620
badly to be our life and our career.
And you know,
obviously times are tough.

1255
01:13:33.621 --> 01:13:34.454
It's like,
you know,

1256
01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:38.690
we're not selling a million records right now and that'd be cool if we did.
Um,

1257
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.870
but you know,
we're working our asses off and it's very rewarding.

1258
01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:45.320
And like if we're not having a blast,

1259
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.570
if we're not having a blast and there's something wrong,

1260
01:13:47.571 --> 01:13:51.140
and even when we're like broke his shit,
which we totally are,

1261
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.520
we're having so much fun.

1262
01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.840
<v 4>Would you guys know the right now you're as legit as you'll ever be.</v>

1263
01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.420
It's impossible.
Pretty much everything is going downhill.

1264
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.420
When success hits you,
then it's like,
oh,
you know what?

1265
01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:07.120
I didn't even fucking respond your tweets anymore.
You know it's going to get,

1266
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.673
you're in the,

1267
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.970
<v 0>you're in the perfect position because,</v>

1268
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:14.530
because once you become famous and once everything takes off,

1269
01:14:14.531 --> 01:14:16.420
then people are going to be looking at you like,
ah,
you know,

1270
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:19.660
and you're just like fucking mainstream now.
It's like you're not the same.

1271
01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:21.190
You know what you were like right now you're like,

1272
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:24.640
you're in your romantic prime and you guys are,
you remember that?

1273
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:27.970
Just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet.

1274
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.440
You ever heard that Boston song?

1275
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:33.820
We were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet

1276
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:37.060
sleeping in our car.
I forget the fucking lyrics,

1277
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.630
but the point is they did a show.

1278
01:14:40.631 --> 01:14:42.880
A guy came to this show and they got discovered.

1279
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:46.180
You guys are like right there when the guy comes to the show and next thing you

1280
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:50.970
know you're on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine with Matt Tie.
He be who was,

1281
01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:52.480
you don't know Matt Taibbi is?
No,

1282
01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.830
but he's the hunter s Thompson for 2012 but it's pretty cool.
Brilliant writer.

1283
01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:00.400
Wow.
A little mean a little on the mean side.

1284
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.220
Andrew Breitbart died and the day he died,

1285
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:05.400
he wrote an article called death of a douchebag.

1286
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:10.690
The day he died.
And I was like,
wow,
he doesn't give a shit.

1287
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:13.260
Yeah.
Well,
you know Matt,
Matt,

1288
01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.020
Matt Taibbi is fucking flock.
No,
no.
He,

1289
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.520
he died natural causes.
No.
Breitbart died of natural causes and you know,

1290
01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:26.320
it's like,
wow,
Matt Taibbi doesn't give a fuck,
you know,
like that or,
or,

1291
01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:29.580
or it's a calculated move either way.
But the,
the thing is people were there.

1292
01:15:29.581 --> 01:15:32.680
It was a lot of people who were so upset about Breitbart's politics that they

1293
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:36.970
didn't seem to mind at this happened that he died like that.
So I was like,
wow.

1294
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:39.460
You know,
I was like,
wow,
Matt Taibbi is a bad mother fucker.

1295
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.890
I can't believe you did that.
Hunters Thompson gave me shit.
Either he didn't.

1296
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.640
And I don't agree with Matt Tie.
He'd be,
I would have never done that.

1297
01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.830
Even if it was worth it.
My worst enemy,
I would have never done that.

1298
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.890
But a guy who's willing to do that.
Holy Shit,
that guy's got balls.

1299
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.600
And I guess the point is like,
you know,

1300
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:54.760
you're not forgive him for being a con just because you're dead

1301
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:03.130
for good or for evil.
You know whether it's right or wrong,
neither should do me.

1302
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:05.680
Yeah,
you,
you know,
look,
we should all be,

1303
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.670
we should all be sorry for all the shitty things we've done while we're alive.

1304
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.670
But just because you're dead doesn't mean we're supposed to reexamine your

1305
01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:16.940
existence.
Right?
I mean for your own good,
for the good of your own history.
It's,

1306
01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:19.090
it's better to keep things real.
Well I don't know.

1307
01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:23.380
Maybe you should reexamined cause then you have this ultimate perspective.

1308
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:28.320
But at the same time,
if you were in fact a Douche bag,
then
you can't,

1309
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:31.540
terrible feeling can change in the afterlife.
But at least you're in the clouds.

1310
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.190
You're hanging out with harp dudes.

1311
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:38.350
Why Harps and haven't please beautiful.
I'm having it doesn't get a violin.

1312
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.950
Violence is really hard to learn.
And when you're learning it sounds like shit.

1313
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:45.310
And when you've learned it and you haven't practiced it sounds like shit.

1314
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.580
One of the things that I really like about your music is it make me,

1315
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:52.570
made me remember how much I like songs with violins in them.
It's very rare.

1316
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.990
Beg to differ with you.
This

1317
01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.840
beautiful instrument,
there's a powerful,
there's a,
there's a thing to a violin,

1318
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:03.000
you know?
I mean there's like,

1319
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.520
there's a reason why the devil went down to Georgia is such a bad ass song and

1320
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:10.160
it's not because of guitars or drums.
It's a fucking violin man.

1321
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.500
<v 1>It's a violin battle.
It's a violent battle with the devil.
Okay,</v>

1322
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:18.020
Charlie,
this motherfucking Daniel's,
by the way,

1323
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.340
in a violin battle with Satan.
You know,
come on man.

1324
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:23.300
It's not a one one.

1325
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:25.910
And anybody would say there's something wrong with the violin,

1326
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:28.760
doesn't understand life,
you know,
it's not,

1327
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:31.280
there's nothing wrong with the violin is with some wrong,

1328
01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:36.050
is the application of the violin,
the violin when properly applied,

1329
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:40.130
is that a word?
Properly applied,
properly applied.
It's,
it's beautiful.
It's,

1330
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.620
you guys use it a lot.
Use a violent a lot

1331
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.110
lately.
Been using the Banjo a little bit more,
but it's in there.

1332
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:51.790
It's woven in there.
What little threads of it you're,

1333
01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.160
you've got kind of like a little country sort of a thing going on,

1334
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.380
like there's a lot of country influence to it.
Like a lot of stuff you do.

1335
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.240
I think that the angel of death is it total throwback country tune stylistically

1336
01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:09.800
speaking.
What about let's get wrecked,
but that's,
that's not country.

1337
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:13.670
That's more like rockabilly unfortunately.
Rock and roll.
Oh really?

1338
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:17.290
I feel like we blew it on that song a little bit.
We did.

1339
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.680
We're trying to rework the course isn't what it should hold.

1340
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.340
Please shut the fuck up.
You guys are out of your mind

1341
01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:30.380
to just tell you how we really feel.
Well,
I know that you listen,

1342
01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:31.214
there's a lot of jokes,

1343
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.020
jokes that I've recorded on CD and then like a month later and know how to do

1344
01:18:35.021 --> 01:18:38.270
them better.
I'm like,
fuck,
it's too late.
I know they're gone,

1345
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:42.980
but he got accepted as a observer.
That's one of my favorite songs.

1346
01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:46.310
Do you guys have,
I love that song,
but you know it's funny.

1347
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:51.230
It's like Bob Dylan rip off for sure.
Shit happens.

1348
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:54.260
It sounds very Johnny Cash ish in the beginning.
Well,

1349
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:57.230
they dug like the way there.
The writing is,
well,

1350
01:18:57.231 --> 01:19:01.660
there's a song called Bob Dylan's a hundred 15th dream,
uh,
which is on this,
uh,

1351
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:04.340
it's bringing it back home as the record,

1352
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:06.990
the name of the record and it's just like,
it's that I was,

1353
01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.160
we were just trying to write that song.
Literally.
Sorry.

1354
01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:14.990
What is Bob Dylan Son's name again?
Jacob.
Jacob wallflowers.

1355
01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.700
He's,
uh,
his kids were fear factor fans really.

1356
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:22.310
And I got to meet him like way back in the day when fear factor was on TV,

1357
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.800
you know,
as kids like wanting to meet me,
I was like,
Holy Shit,

1358
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:28.940
I'm meeting pump Dylan's fucking song.
And that,
I really liked those guys too,

1359
01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:31.910
by the way.
I think there,
there are two albums are fucking amazing.

1360
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:37.310
He wrote some really great,
there's one,
I got one of those ex-girlfriend songs,

1361
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:37.731
you know,

1362
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:41.930
or you can't listen to it because it's that one person in your life and it's

1363
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:46.750
like,
boom.
It's like there's one song that that dude put out.
Wow.

1364
01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.280
That's this thing of the past.
Yeah.

1365
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:55.990
Everybody's got a sting or more or what other stuff do you listen to?

1366
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:00.890
You know what,
man,
I've got pretty eclectic tastes,
you know,
I'll be,

1367
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.800
I like a lot of old shit for somebody.
I'm not a mean old.

1368
01:20:03.801 --> 01:20:07.100
I mean like seventies and sixties,
like American rock.

1369
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:12.770
<v 4>How dare you can't stay but by testicular output.</v>

1370
01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:14.283
So Shiloh,

1371
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.330
<v 1>um,
a lot of like Leonard Skinner did a lot of shit.</v>

1372
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:21.840
I like a lot of like almond brothers Shit.
I'm like a lot of,

1373
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:26.790
I like a lot of southern rock.
You know,
I like a lot of,
I think there's like,

1374
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:28.130
it's like there's a bit of,

1375
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.320
there's less pretension and more rhythm to a lot of southern rock that I really

1376
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:35.430
like,
you know?
And I love,
uh,

1377
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:38.160
I love like Leonard Leonard Skinner when they got big,

1378
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:42.210
put out some of my favorite shit because it was all about getting the fuck away

1379
01:20:42.211 --> 01:20:43.044
from people.

1380
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:46.940
<v 4>Well,
there's songs,
10 songs,</v>

1381
01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:51.820
get the fuck away from me.
I mean,
every song was,
I got to be free.

1382
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:56.900
I'm a free bird.
Every fucking song was just like,
leave me alone.
Whoops.

1383
01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:01.170
<v 1>You know,
Lord,
I can't change,
you know,
kind of go.</v>

1384
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.670
That's funny though.
They call me the breeze.
See?

1385
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:09.300
I was like over and over and over again because all they're worried he's getting

1386
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:12.790
tugged on by a billion people,
but they still had that,

1387
01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:14.940
you know that that southern rock flavor,

1388
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:18.720
you know that there's like a twinkie Sorta,
you know,

1389
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:21.600
like a more of a rhythmic thing to a lot of the southern rock

1390
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.670
Stevie Ray Vaughan Vaughan,

1391
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.800
he's the Shit God I that that was one of the dudes I never learned to play like

1392
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:35.430
that,
but he was one of the guitar hero guys that I really connected with.

1393
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:40.200
I used to listen to those records all the time to like Texas Flood Jews.

1394
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:44.600
Come on,
man.
Couldn't stand the weather.
The live version.

1395
01:21:44.601 --> 01:21:46.250
I couldn't stand the weather.
When you,

1396
01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:51.251
you listened to that please everybody go get that Stevie labor on Rayvon live

1397
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:54.250
with double trouble.
Right?
It was,
couldn't stand the weather.
Was this one,

1398
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.170
the old one?

1399
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:59.370
It was like an 83 or something before they don't remember what it was,

1400
01:21:59.371 --> 01:21:59.910
but there was a,

1401
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:03.570
he had a bunch of live versions of songs that were really amazing.

1402
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.120
One of them was a Voodoo child.
You ever heard him do Voodoo Child?

1403
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.600
Oh my God.
It's one of the best versions of,
look,
I'm a huge Hendrix fan.

1404
01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.450
I mean the reason why we,
we called this the Joe Rogan experience,

1405
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:19.250
total rip off with Jimi Hendrix.
Cause when I was a kid I was a huge Hendrix fan.

1406
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:24.260
Like always the only guy who ever took a song that Hendricks did and put it in a

1407
01:22:25.351 --> 01:22:27.720
different place.
Not necessarily a better place,

1408
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:29.970
but at different place was Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1409
01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:33.560
He has so much respect for Hendricks too.
That was the thing I think.
Yeah.

1410
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:36.720
And Open respect.
And if his in his music videos,

1411
01:22:36.721 --> 01:22:40.620
he had like Hendrix posters in the back.
He liked loved Hendrix.

1412
01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:43.980
It wasn't like there was no,
there was no like swagger Jack and going on.

1413
01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:46.170
It was just like,
this is his version of it.

1414
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:52.110
When did Stevie Ray Vaughan pass away in 95.
You don't almost got to drive him.

1415
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:54.220
How's that limousine driver in Boston?
When I was,
when I,

1416
01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:58.830
she almost got to drive him.
Yeah.
I was 20,
19,
20,

1417
01:22:58.831 --> 01:23:02.540
somewhere around there.
And um,
the um,
he was touring with depth.

1418
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:06.760
Jeff Beck and Jeff Beck got the van but Stevie Ray Vaughan

1419
01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.540
<v 0>wouldn't get in any limousines.
He would only take cabs.
Huh.</v>

1420
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:15.120
So he like,
yeah,
he didn't like being in limos.
It's was like this is creeping.

1421
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:18.730
Maybe we get in cabs cause he likes to talk to people in smoke cigarettes.

1422
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.720
That's cool.
Even cooler,
you got to check out,
you know,

1423
01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:27.490
Gary Clark Jr you gotta check out here every once in a while.

1424
01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:30.490
And Stevie Ray Vaughan was one of these guys who brought blues to a point where

1425
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.620
the mainstream could really appreciate it.

1426
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.920
And I feel like Gary Clark Jr is doing that right now.
Gary Clark Jr he's the,

1427
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:37.840
he's the real deal.

1428
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:43.500
I got into a female singers when I was a kid because a while was doing a martial

1429
01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:46.810
arts competitions and kickboxing.

1430
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.630
I would always look for something that was like the opposite of that.

1431
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.620
Something that was like calming,
you know,
because it's really cool.
Yeah.

1432
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.500
Well I think,
yeah,
I read the book of five rings.

1433
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:59.270
It's a book by this Guy Miyamoto Musashi,
who was a,

1434
01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.190
a Great Samurai and killed like 62 men and one on one battles,

1435
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.690
but sword fighting and shit.
And um,
he,
he,

1436
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:11.200
he wrote this thing and it's called the book of five rings and what the Book of

1437
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:11.910
five rings is,

1438
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:15.910
it's a book on how to live life and it's basically all about balance.

1439
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.540
And one of the things that he proposed that every Samurai should also be an

1440
01:24:19.541 --> 01:24:22.870
artist and you should be well versed in poetry and they,

1441
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:24.340
you should be able to express yourself.

1442
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:28.480
There should be no holes in your ego and she'd be no kinks in your game.
Wow.

1443
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.250
And so when I was competing,
I recognize that my,
you know,

1444
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:37.060
as a man,
you're your biggest insecurity when you're young,
especially,

1445
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:39.610
it's like a weakness.
Any sort of weakness,
whether it's low,

1446
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.510
like I used to even literally think that sex like pleasure was a weakness,

1447
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:46.960
you know,
because,
well,
no,
no,
no,
it wasn't even that it was fighting.

1448
01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:52.110
It was a discipline issue is desire.
Discipline.
It was exactly,
it was.
Yeah,

1449
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:55.810
it was,
it was the,
uh,
the,
not just desire but pleasure.

1450
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:59.140
Like you don't need pleasure bitch,
get out,
run,
go run hills in the now.

1451
01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.040
And so this,
this,
this book sort of,
uh,

1452
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:08.060
introduced my head to the idea of relaxing some of my cave man bullshit and

1453
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.580
appreciating like the feminine aspects of things.

1454
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.370
So the first thing I started getting into it was like women singers.

1455
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:17.660
And so I was like,
uh,

1456
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:22.770
I think it was like 18 or 19 years old when I got into like a Ricky Lee Jones

1457
01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.620
Chucky's and love dude,
that's a great got down song.
She was a bad ass bitch.

1458
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:37.670
She was a bad ass bitch.
Oh fuck yeah.
You kidding me?
We play,

1459
01:25:37.671 --> 01:25:41.490
you're no good.
All the time on this show.
We played it to the point where I got,

1460
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.940
I got mad at him.
I got huge diamond Ross Fan.
Big nipples.
Yeah.

1461
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.490
It looks like Diana Ross right now.
Oops.

1462
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.410
There's a lot of guys,
man.
When I,
when I told you,
uh,
you know,
when I,

1463
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:59.350
when I tweeted,
you know,
all these guys are the shit,
you know,

1464
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:02.820
check out this video and I put one of your videos up.
I got called a home.

1465
01:26:02.821 --> 01:26:04.270
I'll at least a hundred people

1466
01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:10.980
<v 4>it looks like,
let's do they're afraid though.
It's fucking terrified to fluky.</v>

1467
01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.150
<v 0>There's something about a guy liking like something weak and soft.
Like,
Oh,</v>

1468
01:26:16.151 --> 01:26:18.130
I love cuddles.
Oh,
Loke Hawk.

1469
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:22.280
<v 4>Fuck that pussy.
You know what?
Every,
every,
every strong man,</v>

1470
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:25.970
every like when you get sick,
you still get the fucking sniffles.
It's true.

1471
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.980
Bracing,
like how you're thinking.

1472
01:26:30.370 --> 01:26:34.750
I've got it made sense.
You know what I mean?
Like you can,

1473
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.760
you can act tough.
You can be as tough as you want to be,
but when you're sick,

1474
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:41.360
you get the sniffles and you may like it and you make movies

1475
01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:47.290
in the answer twice a day.
If you're lucky,
you're lucky.
Take your neighbor

1476
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:52.250
<v 0>Broccoli.
You don't,
you might have issues.
Yeah.
Right?</v>

1477
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.400
And in the end we're all dead anyway.
What the fuck?
So you know,
it takes a,

1478
01:26:55.401 --> 01:26:57.890
there's a certain amount of time that you need to live on this light before you

1479
01:26:57.891 --> 01:26:59.570
sort of accept the fact that,
you know,

1480
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:02.840
just kind of enjoy this and realize that none of it makes any fucking sense.

1481
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:06.250
<v 3>You know,
I don't want to go backwards here,
but you were really,</v>

1482
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:10.390
you really impressed and inspired me when you were talking about this book of

1483
01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:13.220
five rings and in martial arts and like,
you know,

1484
01:27:13.221 --> 01:27:14.950
you would think you would think that

1485
01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:19.590
<v 0>that's correct.
Musashi.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
That's really beautiful.
Yeah.</v>

1486
01:27:19.591 --> 01:27:23.190
This was this Guy Aaron Dellavedova from grew tattoo in San Diego.
Did it.

1487
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.980
But that's what it is.
Minimum Miyamoto Musashi.

1488
01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:29.160
<v 3>But I,
I mean,
I think there's something that's it,</v>

1489
01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:34.090
it's true wisdom when you can have a balance of calm within,

1490
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.510
within the arena of,
um,

1491
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:39.390
I don't want to say war cause that sounds really dramatic,
but,

1492
01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.700
but like when you're,
um,
in,

1493
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.100
I don't want to in battle,
but in the,

1494
01:27:45.101 --> 01:27:48.310
in the proverbial sense if it just like competition pressure,

1495
01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.140
but like in life in general,
you know what I mean?

1496
01:27:50.141 --> 01:27:51.540
Because there's a lot of shit out there,

1497
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:55.060
especially if you're doing something like that or like even when you play a
show,

1498
01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:56.350
like where you have to,

1499
01:27:56.351 --> 01:28:00.880
you have to center yourself and it's really easy to,

1500
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:05.200
um,
want to just die.
You got to check the pool for water before you dive in.

1501
01:28:05.201 --> 01:28:06.070
You know what I mean?
It's like,

1502
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.450
it's really easy to just go into situations in any capacity,
in any facet,

1503
01:28:10.690 --> 01:28:14.230
whether it's you're going to work or you're in a competition or you're playing a

1504
01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.300
rock show or you're dating.

1505
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:21.560
<v 4>Yeah.
Without,
without that is sometimes a fucking wrestling matches.</v>

1506
01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.660
[inaudible] kidding me.
Good God,
I'm in my late twenties.
I know,

1507
01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.740
but,
but seriously,
early,
late twenties.
Thank you Ben.

1508
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:34.370
That's really nice of you to redeem yourself after calling me old in the cow.

1509
01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:39.290
Take that bar.
You got to take that.
You can see,
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

1510
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:44.060
Fresh and mark with the condition always.

1511
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:46.300
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1512
01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:51.300
it came my ideas of chasing down like a balance came at a very purely selfish

1513
01:28:52.071 --> 01:28:54.920
reasons.
Initially it was just,
I didn't want to get my ass kicked.

1514
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:59.000
It was that simple.
It's just like to,
to,
to,
to compete better.
I feel,

1515
01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:00.980
I felt like I needed to balance myself out.

1516
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:04.050
I'm really kind of a weird way to approach it,

1517
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:07.470
but to me it's the only thing that made sense.
It's like,
I tried meditation,

1518
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.570
I did that as well,
but there was like,

1519
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:13.470
there was other stuff that needed to be addressed as well.
You know,

1520
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:16.210
<v 2>we,
I have you been competing your whole,
I mean</v>

1521
01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:21.490
<v 0>when I was growing up,
like in high school I did mostly,
you know,</v>

1522
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.470
until I started doing standup comedy and that's when I was like 21 or 22.

1523
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:29.710
So when when I started doing that,
then I just like completely,
uh,

1524
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.180
abandoned the idea of a competition.
I was just sort of doing that at that point.

1525
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:39.280
I have momentum.
I'd done it like so much when I was a young kid,
you know,

1526
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:44.280
but the,
there's a lot of shit that comes out of martial arts that is clearly and

1527
01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:49.240
directly applied to,
uh,
to,
to art,
to any form of art.
You know,

1528
01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.890
and it's from that Musashi book,
you know,
the idea that you,

1529
01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:55.690
there was so much,

1530
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.950
well that's fascinating about that book was this guy that lived,
you know,

1531
01:29:59.951 --> 01:30:01.300
hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

1532
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:06.480
He was basically a man who would go and have one on one battles to the death

1533
01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:11.380
with other men.
So he could have no weakness.

1534
01:30:11.381 --> 01:30:13.450
He could have no imbalance in his,

1535
01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:17.920
in his thought process and his ability to,
to,
you know,
to,
to,

1536
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:20.800
to objectively look at any situation.

1537
01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.280
He had to really be aware of what his strength and weaknesses are,

1538
01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:28.150
how to improve upon himself.
And so this was his approach,
you know?

1539
01:30:28.151 --> 01:30:29.440
And I just always found that like,

1540
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:33.730
who who faced crazier shit than this guy in life,

1541
01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:35.790
61 on one source

1542
01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:41.310
<v 2>because you fucking a man.
But I think it's amazing.
No,
please.</v>

1543
01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:42.980
I said,

1544
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:47.980
I think it's amazing that someone who is so successful and all that stuff was so

1545
01:30:48.111 --> 01:30:51.980
focused on accepting the entirety of himself.
You know what I mean?
Because,

1546
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:54.830
yeah,
exactly.
It's like,

1547
01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:59.900
then if you aren't repressing certain avenues of yourself,

1548
01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.660
I don't see how that would be an unsuccessful.

1549
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:06.410
<v 0>Do you want,
I think we,
we,
a lot of us,
you know,
human beings,</v>

1550
01:31:06.411 --> 01:31:09.870
we require something to imitate.
We require,
uh,

1551
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:13.150
someone who leads by example.
And,
uh,

1552
01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.850
oftentimes we're left in situations where it's all peripheral.

1553
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.610
Like the people that lead by example,
they might be on television or in movies.

1554
01:31:19.611 --> 01:31:21.020
You're not,
sorry,
how much of that is bullshit,

1555
01:31:21.170 --> 01:31:24.470
but are your examples that you're reaching and everyday life they're not,

1556
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:28.930
they're not good.
They're not good examples of people.
So,
you know,
what are your,

1557
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:32.330
what you,
what are you imitating?
I mean the tribe imitates,
you know,

1558
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:35.540
the big buzz of the hive.
I mean if you look at like Japan,

1559
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.560
it's a perfect example.
I just got back from there.
Super Polite,

1560
01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:44.540
strange alien culture or everyone's nice and everyone's height,

1561
01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.720
height.
Everywhere you go,
everyone is super polite and you're like,

1562
01:31:47.721 --> 01:31:51.880
why did this happen?
How did this happen?
Because somehow or another they,

1563
01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.550
they engender this type of thinking and a gotten a buzz and then everybody just

1564
01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:58.100
copied everybody else and then it became what it is.

1565
01:31:58.310 --> 01:32:03.040
It became what it is was planted,
it grew and now it is what it is.
But you know,

1566
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.830
that's not,
that's,
it's not easy to pull off a Japan.

1567
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:09.850
It's not easy to pull it off with Japan,
but it is what we will,
we need.

1568
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.790
Well one of the things we need,
especially when we're young,
we need examples.

1569
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:15.010
We need other,
we need someone else to imitate.

1570
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:18.700
We need someone else to say we need someone that shows.
It's why we love heroes.

1571
01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:21.790
It's why we love,
you know,
the great heroes of movies.
I mean,

1572
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:22.900
Joseph Campbell stories,

1573
01:32:22.901 --> 01:32:27.430
it's all the idea behind it is all that we need someone to aspire to so that we

1574
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.550
realize the weaknesses of our own,
you know,
insecurities.
Our,
our,
our,

1575
01:32:31.551 --> 01:32:36.400
our own dissatisfaction with who we are.
Yeah.
You know,
cat,

1576
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:40.900
it's just too much.
No,
this is amazing.
No,
this is deep.
It's too much.

1577
01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:43.200
<v 2>It's an interesting thing because your,</v>

1578
01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.020
your perspective going to a place like Japan,
you're,

1579
01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:50.280
you're going there as a successful entertainer,
you know what I mean?

1580
01:32:50.281 --> 01:32:53.820
And that also,
not to challenge your perceptions at all,

1581
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:57.390
but your perspective is,
uh,

1582
01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:02.490
someone who people in that environment are looking to please as well.

1583
01:33:02.491 --> 01:33:03.100
You know what I mean?

1584
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.040
<v 0>That's definitely a good point.
But,
um,
uh,
I really,</v>

1585
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:10.810
I saw it amongst everyone everywhere.
Yeah.
The way I,
I really,

1586
01:33:10.811 --> 01:33:13.570
um,
I,
I watched a lot of people,
I sat down,

1587
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.490
I sat down in the hotel lobby for a long time,

1588
01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:18.040
one day just watching people interact with each other.
And there were,

1589
01:33:18.041 --> 01:33:18.874
there were so polite,

1590
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:23.960
so amazing and everyone's like slightly bowing to each other.
And Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

1591
01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:28.010
Everyone is just really trying to be super accommodating.
The security at the,

1592
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:28.690
the,
uh,

1593
01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:33.690
arena could not have been polite or you were easily by far right Brian easiest

1594
01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:36.620
too.
I get past the security also.
Remember that?
Yeah.

1595
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.430
Well they didn't understand that Brian was with me.
You know,
I have these,
uh,

1596
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:44.110
these passes and it's supposed to be like,
you know,
like just leave me alone.

1597
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:47.050
You know,
there's a big pass.
I know what I'm doing and you know,
when I'm,

1598
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:50.020
I'm trying to move the guy through,
I'm like,
he's with me.
It's okay.
He's with me.

1599
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:53.170
And they just didn't know what the fuck that meant.
Yeah.
In,
in America,

1600
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:56.920
we do it all the time.
Know everyone knows every,
you know,
it's cool.
But you know,

1601
01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.920
in,
in Japan they didn't know what was going on.
So I was like,
it's okay.

1602
01:33:59.921 --> 01:34:03.130
It's okay.
They're like,
okay.
You sure it was this weird communication.

1603
01:34:03.131 --> 01:34:06.100
Like they didn't understand English.
We kind of put,
but they were so polite.

1604
01:34:06.101 --> 01:34:09.370
They just let us go by cause nobody,
it's not,
I mean,

1605
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:11.920
I want to say nobody like would bullshit their way there.

1606
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.380
But it's much more uncommon than it is in America.

1607
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:17.070
You can never just let a guy come up.
Do you go out?

1608
01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:20.160
I gotta go over there real quick.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

1609
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.160
<v 2>Suzanne lived in.
This is something I love about Suzanne.
She lived in Tokyo.
What?</v>

1610
01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:25.994
She was like 16

1611
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:31.180
<v 4>as a model.
Yeah.
How dare you hang out with the Russians.
I didn't,</v>

1612
01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:35.890
I had some Russian friends.
Yeah.
Wow.
What was that like?
Um,

1613
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:39.430
you know,
it was,
I was 16.
I was so young.
Oh,

1614
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:43.500
who the fall let you go then when you were 16 parents.
Why?

1615
01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:49.240
What the fuck man,
folks,
let me move to New York when I was 16 to,

1616
01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:54.400
you know,
this,
it's like there's,
there's details.
Like they,
they,

1617
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.140
they were with me for a lot of the times.
My,
again,
I'm sorry,

1618
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.500
<v 3>come on man.
But you know,
culturally speaking for,
for Japan,</v>

1619
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.950
um,
there was it,
it's definitely jolting.

1620
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.520
Especially when I was that young going,
you know,
over 10 years ago,
Jesus,
I'm old.

1621
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:12.500
I'm sorry.
This dumb.

1622
01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.280
<v 1>No,
you didn't,
you just were there when you were a baby.</v>

1623
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:19.300
<v 3>Say like over 10 years ago it was,
it's very weird,
but yeah,</v>

1624
01:35:19.301 --> 01:35:22.870
but you were fucking 16.
I was,
that's crazy.
I was,

1625
01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:26.020
what's that about what it was your mom thinking?
Just get her,

1626
01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:30.050
you know what my folks,
they were really know.
My parents are,

1627
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:31.400
are really amazing people.
Yeah.

1628
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.580
<v 1>They were super supportive.
You by you being a model of Japan?</v>

1629
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.930
Not that they've always done.

1630
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:39.720
<v 3>They've known that.
I,
I have,
I've been driven with things like,</v>

1631
01:35:39.721 --> 01:35:41.130
I've always had things,
you know,

1632
01:35:41.131 --> 01:35:44.940
like I grew up doing a lot of musical theater and I sing in a choir and I played

1633
01:35:44.941 --> 01:35:48.580
in orchestra and,
and I just would work my ass off like this.

1634
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.490
Things that I loved and they,

1635
01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.020
I attribute a lot of my opportunities to the,

1636
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:57.750
their support because they were never like,
no,
you can't do that.

1637
01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.960
You're too young.
They were just like,
yeah,
let's do this.
They minded.

1638
01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:05.220
They were great.
Yeah.
They still are.
You know,
I,
I,
uh,
they live in Ohio,

1639
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.410
but they,
um,
you know,
I,
oh wait.
Yeah.
It's okay.

1640
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:14.400
I've got a lot of,
what do they do?
What does your dad do?
What was your mind?

1641
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:16.840
My family owns a restaurant,
an Italian restaurant,
yet might,

1642
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.880
my grandparents started it in what's called Santo on this crazy journey to be a

1643
01:36:21.931 --> 01:36:25.440
model in Japan at 16 years old.
I started locally in Cleveland.

1644
01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.350
I was in like value city department store heads growing up.

1645
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:29.780
And how long would you occasionally,

1646
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:33.000
it'll be like totally mortifying because I'd be in like a Dick's sporting goods,

1647
01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:35.640
add in a sports bra and I go to high school whenever everyone

1648
01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:40.690
<v 1>like,
Hey,
I saw you in your training bro.
I'm like,
do you look for athletes?
Wow.</v>

1649
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:45.650
<v 3>You Jackass.
Um,
but no,
they,
they let me,
they let me go.
Um,</v>

1650
01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:46.460
I,

1651
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:51.460
I was scouted by an agency when I had previously spent my summer in Chicago when

1652
01:36:52.461 --> 01:36:56.870
I was 15,
which is so funny cause like the agency was like,

1653
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:59.000
there's going to be chaperones and you guys,

1654
01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:01.580
they're going to live in like a model's apartment and there's people there.

1655
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:04.840
And like,
I did whatever I wanted and I was going to bars and I was,

1656
01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.870
it was crazy.
It was crazy.
But you know,

1657
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:13.820
I did.
I didn't,
I was like,
you know,
I was still a virgin till then.

1658
01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:19.680
<v 1>Just a real personal,
I have three daughters.
Don't freak me out.
I'm not,
I'm not.</v>

1659
01:37:19.681 --> 01:37:23.230
No,
no.
You know what,
just talk to read.
Dot.
I talked to Doc.

1660
01:37:23.231 --> 01:37:27.170
Talk to him like crazy,
bro.
Suzanne has two sisters,
three sisters,

1661
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:32.120
three sisters,
four girls in my family.
Are you the oldest?
The youngest?
Oh,

1662
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:34.410
Jesus Christ.
They've given up by then of course,
the leg.

1663
01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:39.420
Of course they let you go.
Jesus Christ.
That's ridiculous.
If you're a baby,

1664
01:37:39.421 --> 01:37:40.620
number one,
I want to tell you what,

1665
01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:44.640
it never made that fucking trip thrown in the towel.
Well,
no,
it's not even that.

1666
01:37:44.641 --> 01:37:46.260
It's the tail.
It had been terrified of losing you,

1667
01:37:46.261 --> 01:37:49.050
but by the time they got down to you,
they were like,
let her free.
Go ahead.

1668
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.470
Japan sounds reasonable.
I heard they're nice.

1669
01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.120
Japanese people are polite.
Good luck there kid.
Wow.

1670
01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.370
What's the longest time you stayed there?

1671
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:03.720
<v 3>Uh,
I was there for like two months.
Wow.
My whole summer basically.</v>

1672
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:07.110
Whoa.
Anything creepy ever happened?
Um,

1673
01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:13.540
in a lot of creepy stuff.
But nothing that was like,

1674
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:18.570
nothing that was dangerous or bad for me,
but just like in enticing,

1675
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.750
um,
I gross,
enjoyable.

1676
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:25.740
So I vomiting.
This is the funny part.
So I,

1677
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:29.020
I don't know if I should talk about that.
Sure.
Aleisha so,

1678
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:34.100
so I did the one and only time that I've ever done ecstasy was in Japan and I

1679
01:38:35.161 --> 01:38:35.820
was with,

1680
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:40.820
I was with this incredibly beautiful professional boxer from New Zealand.

1681
01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:45.210
And so basically like we did ecstasy.

1682
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:48.990
Do you have a song written about this thing?
No,
no,
no.
We made out,
right.
We ate,

1683
01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.350
we ate popsicles and watching the matrix and like later as an adult,

1684
01:38:52.351 --> 01:38:53.250
I look back and I'm like,

1685
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:56.670
I can't believe like I didn't get raped or something or,
you know what I mean?

1686
01:38:56.671 --> 01:38:59.880
Like I totally like,
you know,
that was it.
It was like totally innocent.

1687
01:38:59.881 --> 01:39:02.680
And like literally when I got off the plane I was like,
Hey mom,
dad,

1688
01:39:02.681 --> 01:39:05.470
I had a really good time in Japan.
I tried ecstasy.
It's still a virgin.

1689
01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.420
Everything's good.

1690
01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:12.980
Like I told him about the messages you can look for and like everything's fine.

1691
01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:16.830
You know?
It sounds like an amazing game show.
Yeah.

1692
01:39:16.831 --> 01:39:18.810
You might be the coolest chick of all time.

1693
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:25.600
<v 1>You want to do that tonight?
We don't have to wake up early.</v>

1694
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:29.950
It's going to be that kind of party.
Actually.
I think we do do it.

1695
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:31.610
Why do you guys have like what's going on now?

1696
01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:34.010
You guys know concerts going on big.
A lot of big shows.

1697
01:39:34.011 --> 01:39:36.590
You were saying that you were showing Santa Monica that you're nervous about

1698
01:39:36.591 --> 01:39:37.424
your upcoming shit.

1699
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:40.370
<v 3>We,
well we have a lot of things coming up but you know it's funny,</v>

1700
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.270
Newport folk festival people are listening and they were asking us to talk about

1701
01:39:44.271 --> 01:39:46.220
that.
But yeah,
people

1702
01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.150
<v 1>shut their pie hole.</v>

1703
01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.830
What you were talking about because the honey honey band at Twitter.
Okay.

1704
01:39:51.831 --> 01:39:54.200
All the information should be in your background.

1705
01:39:54.201 --> 01:39:57.360
Put that shit up on your back wall,
your wallpaper,
you know.
Well,

1706
01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.400
so when people go to view entire profile,
go to honey honey,

1707
01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:02.510
band.com is that it?

1708
01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:06.290
Is that what your ad is it everybody always wants you to like really focus on

1709
01:40:06.291 --> 01:40:10.910
their thing though.
Well,
you know,
we've got a big summer.

1710
01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.170
That is a great festival though.
It is.
They're all great.
We're fucking pumps.

1711
01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.440
We know we have,
we have great stuff coming up.
We're playing south by South West,

1712
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:20.690
which is next week.
Is that true?
That they just like,

1713
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.800
they don't don't pay for plane tickets.
They don't want to pay for shit.
But no,

1714
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:28.700
we're not going to pitch
our asses on that word.
But you know what?

1715
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.940
Damn good time losing our ass.
I'm sure you are.

1716
01:40:31.941 --> 01:40:34.910
But isn't that a little odd that south by south,
my friend Duncan Trussell,

1717
01:40:34.911 --> 01:40:38.450
he's a standup comedian,
got invited to south by southwest and he,

1718
01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.080
he had no idea that this was the case.

1719
01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.960
And he said this is the most preposterous fucking thing of all time.

1720
01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:49.640
It's like this is like a big financial success and they're not paying anybody.

1721
01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.400
And so he made this whole video of Hitler screaming and yelling.

1722
01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.500
He's like yelling at people and in the,
you know,

1723
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:59.380
you don't know what the Fuck Hitler says unless you speak Germany,
German,

1724
01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:02.530
Germany,
China as a country.
And he was,
so he's got,

1725
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.390
he's got in subtitles in English,

1726
01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.590
all the different things about can you fucking believe how south by southwest

1727
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:11.390
works?
You know how ridiculous it is that they just fly you up.
I mean,
you,

1728
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.790
they don't even fly you out there.
They don't do any,

1729
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.870
give you room ticket and at least give you a drink

1730
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:22.870
bottle.
They,
well that means that's the bit,

1731
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:25.860
that means that somebody is donating bottles.
But,

1732
01:41:25.861 --> 01:41:30.200
but they south by south west kind of like a,
uh,
a morphous thing.

1733
01:41:30.201 --> 01:41:33.050
It's like we're,
we're playing shows.
None,
none of them,

1734
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.530
none of the shows were playing our south by southwest.
There are people who are,

1735
01:41:36.531 --> 01:41:40.640
have kind of venue set up at south by south.
Oh,
I see.
Yeah.
So it's,
you know,

1736
01:41:40.641 --> 01:41:44.160
it's a,
it's a crazy thing.
My friend Doug stand helps you to do that with um,

1737
01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.950
the Montreal comedy festival.

1738
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.430
The Montreal comedy festival used to be called just for laughs and it was like

1739
01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:52.580
the big industry festival.
It's still is sort of,
and uh,

1740
01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:55.880
he would do just for spite and do it the exact same time that they would do it

1741
01:41:55.881 --> 01:41:59.310
and do his own shows in town.
Just sort of piggy backing.
Funny.

1742
01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.640
So is that sort of like that kind of a thing?

1743
01:42:01.641 --> 01:42:04.370
Like everybody like gathers in that town,

1744
01:42:04.371 --> 01:42:07.160
he put all kinds of shows happen in the town.
I mean it's a convention.

1745
01:42:07.161 --> 01:42:09.110
It's a real cool,
like that's what it's based on.

1746
01:42:09.111 --> 01:42:11.090
And that's the reality of it is a convention.

1747
01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:14.000
How many people pay attention to that aspect of it?
But all these people,

1748
01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:17.180
everyone from the industry just comes in and wants to showcase.

1749
01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:20.180
How would it be cool if they just paid for your plane ticket and your hotel
room?

1750
01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.470
You know,
I mean look,
you know,

1751
01:42:21.471 --> 01:42:26.150
if you really want to operate in the idea that it's a huge publicity and I guess

1752
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:29.760
it martial arts,
you know,
sweet moves,

1753
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:33.670
no one wants to pay for shit that you mean that

1754
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:39.150
the Internet is your friend.
These companies are not your friend.

1755
01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:42.590
The Internet's your friend.
The Internet.
Get your,
your information,
your music,

1756
01:42:42.591 --> 01:42:43.820
your thoughts,
your ideas,

1757
01:42:43.821 --> 01:42:47.690
your best shit delivered way better than any of these fucking crazy people and

1758
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:51.470
some weird town that want to fucking put up tents.
That's not it.

1759
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:59.960
But we've had some crazy experiences with Dezin outside of Indianapolis.

1760
01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.620
What happened to the days of Denver?
Actually Denver too.

1761
01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.820
Basically we pretty much banned one more stuck,

1762
01:43:06.821 --> 01:43:09.350
like when we're driving like 18 hours or whatever the fuck.

1763
01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.690
And we get to that point where we're like,
just stop anywhere.

1764
01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:15.900
It doesn't matter if there's a days inn,
don't go ever.
Wow.
Sorry.

1765
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:22.930
Brian knows the worst craisins before.

1766
01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:28.210
I've had no issues when though Joe back in the design has changed you saying

1767
01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.810
that,
but I don't think you can generalize.
How many days is have you stayed in?

1768
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.560
Give me a number 30 bed to for to now.
Okay.
That's not enough to judge.
No,

1769
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:40.460
you're right.
That's a Nielsen number.

1770
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:47.120
We have a hundred percent fucking creep us out.
It was a crack house.

1771
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:52.070
That does happen occasionally.
Cleveland

1772
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.240
<v 4>podcast.
Why I don't give a fuck it good cause listen,
first of all,
it's not meat.</v>

1773
01:43:56.241 --> 01:44:00.780
It's saying it.
It's really clear that this is

1774
01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:07.550
funny.
Honey,
run this through a computer and this for sure.
That's not my voice.

1775
01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:12.190
We've had,
we've had,
we went to day's inn.
This is in Denver.
Um,

1776
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.890
first of all that the man in front of me,
uh,

1777
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:19.370
booking his room and days inn was buying condoms with loose change.

1778
01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.840
This is not true.
Not An exaggeration.
When we got up to the room,

1779
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:28.520
somebody was in our room,
somebody room knock on the door.
Hey,

1780
01:44:28.521 --> 01:44:32.570
we're two 17.
Oh,
okay.
And then he scurried off,
not a joke.

1781
01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.930
And then as we were realizing this was not the position for us to be and we are

1782
01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:39.800
leaving some dude in two 13 try to pick a fight with me.
I said,

1783
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:43.090
came out of the shadows.
Fucking came at me.
Whoa.
What did he say to you?

1784
01:44:43.091 --> 01:44:46.370
Been out of something about me being pussy probably.
I Dunno,
I shrimped out.

1785
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.233
No worries.

1786
01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:57.160
How dare you,
Ben,
your pocket.

1787
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.750
Listen,
I need you guys to,
I need you guys for inspiration.

1788
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:05.511
Listen,

1789
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:10.511
I will do whatever you guys need me to do except anal that

1790
01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:19.480
Brian is just,
that's what he does.
He's a human train wreck.
He's,

1791
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:23.630
he's fucking boards on a railroad track.
Right?
Okay.
It's creating problems.

1792
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.150
Oh,
Brian.
Yeah.
We need to make that shirt.
Yep.
We'll keep talking about it.

1793
01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:30.890
We need to make a shirt that says no Brian,

1794
01:45:31.190 --> 01:45:36.050
because he does this every podcast that's sort of his job.
Oh
wait,

1795
01:45:36.051 --> 01:45:41.051
so something completely inappropriate and only his Ohio mine could figure out

1796
01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:46.090
why are
you guys gonna play the angel dough?
You want to hear it?

1797
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:49.160
Fuck yeah.
Tune up your shit.
I'm going to be,
oh,

1798
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.810
this is the most we've ever repeating any podcasts.
Blame alcohol.

1799
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:00.800
Yeah,
we should do that.

1800
01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.590
Is the sound of a violin beat tomb phone?

1801
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:24.000
It sounds like my ex wife.
What does that mean?

1802
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.120
Are you married right now?
Oh.

1803
01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.660
Did you ever play violin?
And I knew I played trumpet best scene keyboard.

1804
01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:41.630
Do you have any of those incidents with you?
If you'd like to play along with us.

1805
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.470
I don't have him anymore and I don't know how to play anymore.

1806
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:49.570
Hold on now.
I'm good.
I lost of it.

1807
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.100
<v 3>If I play like this,
is that going to be like,</v>

1808
01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:56.220
can I play up to this guy or ship liquid back?
You can play whatever you want.

1809
01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:59.370
Okay.
This is how do I make this thing work?

1810
01:47:00.970 --> 01:47:04.470
I'm moving.
Sorry.
Went to the,
uh,

1811
01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:09.300
application APP now.
Do you find that's accurate enough?
I,
I'd be honest.

1812
01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:12.900
I can't tell the difference.
Yeah,
that's a machine and I am but a man,

1813
01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.470
try that.
Have you guys been back to Ohio lately?

1814
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:20.671
You know what?

1815
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:25.671
I went back to Ohio for a month over Christmas and it was awesome.

1816
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:30.570
We played a show.
That's great.
Um,
I'm in the Cleveland area.

1817
01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.780
Is the flat still around?
I heard no,
I turned even there anymore.

1818
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:38.510
Many people got drunk and drowned in the river.
Yeah.
So that is,
um,
uh,

1819
01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.673
yeah,
it's real.

1820
01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:40.481
<v 0>When I met Suzanne,</v>

1821
01:47:40.481 --> 01:47:43.730
one of the first things she did is tell me about how she met drew Carey.
Oh.

1822
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:47.110
And she ran up to true Carrie and said,
hi drew Carey.
I'm Suzanne.

1823
01:47:47.111 --> 01:47:49.000
I just want to tell you that I'm really proud of you.

1824
01:47:49.001 --> 01:47:50.240
And everything you've done for cleaning.

1825
01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.910
<v 5>I love you so much.
And nobody pimps Cleveland harder than you.</v>

1826
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.720
Is that what she said?
Yeah,

1827
01:47:56.721 --> 01:48:01.020
and he tweeted back like I tweeted at him and he retweeted our tweet.

1828
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:05.400
<v 0>Drew Carey's one of the nicest guys I've ever met,
especially in Hollywood.</v>

1829
01:48:05.401 --> 01:48:09.730
He's such a great guy.
I was around him once,
he was at the Improv and uh,
I'll,

1830
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.670
I'll never forget what he did.
He uh,

1831
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:13.710
there was some kids that were like just starting out.

1832
01:48:13.711 --> 01:48:16.780
They were like open makers and someone asks something,
I don't know.

1833
01:48:16.781 --> 01:48:17.790
I don't know what it was at some,

1834
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:21.590
someone asks him sort of a standup comedy related question and drew Carey like

1835
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.390
made a a point of like look at him in the eye and go,
listen,

1836
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.740
just write one joke every day.
Every day.
Just make yourself right.

1837
01:48:28.741 --> 01:48:32.310
One joke at the end of the week,
you got seven new jokes,
just write one.

1838
01:48:32.311 --> 01:48:36.030
And he was like,
like in the kid was like mystified.
Like,
Holy Shit,

1839
01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:39.240
this is drew Carey.
He was an open miker and true.
Carrie's going,
listen,

1840
01:48:39.241 --> 01:48:42.600
just write one joke every day.
You can do that,
right?
One is sit down,
right.

1841
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:44.920
One joke,
he had a big smile on his face and

1842
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:48.470
<v 5>he's very present.
He's a nice guy.
You're listening to me.</v>

1843
01:48:48.471 --> 01:48:52.780
And then like I was one who was a babbling idiot.
Like I,

1844
01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:57.770
it kind of threw me off that he was like,
hi,
how are you?
Really warm.

1845
01:48:57.771 --> 01:49:00.750
And I was like,
okay,
so gotta go buy.

1846
01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.090
It was totally insane.
Which is

1847
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:06.400
<v 0>good because it's almost accurate.</v>

1848
01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:10.960
It's possible to stay nice person in this crazy world.

1849
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:15.000
It's possible not full as drew Carey made us,
sorry interrupt.
Sorry.
No,
please,

1850
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:19.330
please.
Do you,
I mean like when I think about sitting down and writing a joke,

1851
01:49:19.331 --> 01:49:21.730
I don't under,
you know,
like it feels like,

1852
01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:24.520
I mean I made this stupid because the right songs,
you know,

1853
01:49:24.521 --> 01:49:26.500
so it's the same thing,
but like do you,

1854
01:49:26.501 --> 01:49:29.380
have you been through that period where you sit down and write a joke a day?

1855
01:49:29.381 --> 01:49:32.250
Are you every single day you try to write something?
Well,

1856
01:49:32.251 --> 01:49:34.210
what I do one of three things.

1857
01:49:34.211 --> 01:49:39.130
One one is I start just by just responding to people on Twitter and like looking

1858
01:49:39.131 --> 01:49:41.590
for uh,
interesting things that people were tweeting me.

1859
01:49:41.591 --> 01:49:45.290
It's always some weird fucking thing.
A guy got eaten by a crocodile and this,

1860
01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.870
this thing happened here.

1861
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:49.860
And then they got some new way to develop sperm in a lab.
And there's that.

1862
01:49:49.861 --> 01:49:52.840
There's always a little bit of that.
So I'll do that for like maybe 20 minutes.

1863
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:56.830
And then what I do is I just a,
I just write like essays.

1864
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.490
I just sat down and,
and whatever it is I start with,
it doesn't matter.

1865
01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.530
I could start with talking about,
you know,

1866
01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:06.340
this is why it's good to get trunk and I'll just just start,

1867
01:50:06.670 --> 01:50:10.540
just whatever the fuck comes out of my head.
I just need a starting point.
I need,

1868
01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:13.570
I need to somewhere to press the green light and then I just start writing.

1869
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.330
And as much as it comes out as possible,
and then,
uh,

1870
01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.950
I have to go back and sort of dissect it and then I take chunks out of it and

1871
01:50:20.951 --> 01:50:24.110
then throw those chunks in.
And then those chunks become like,
it,

1872
01:50:24.111 --> 01:50:26.830
it all condensed as it goes through like a filtration process.

1873
01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.270
When then it becomes like don't,
don't,
don't punch line,
you know.
And,

1874
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.220
and sometimes no,
sometimes like you,

1875
01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:37.120
you have to go through like long set up things for like more complex ideas.

1876
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:39.040
But for the most part that's what it all,

1877
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:41.550
what would stand up all comes down to for me.
But,

1878
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:43.430
but everybody has a different way or writing,
you know.

1879
01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.760
I mean do you think about rhythm when you say it cause you want to,

1880
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:48.670
you just went do,
do,
do punch that.
Yes.
I'll definitely,
yeah man,

1881
01:50:48.671 --> 01:50:52.840
rhythm is very important.
Timing is to reporting and it's a very intuitive thing,

1882
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.160
you know,

1883
01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.760
and it requires a lot of repetition requires you doing the material many,

1884
01:50:57.761 --> 01:51:01.660
many times to sort of gauge what feels false about it.
You know,

1885
01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:03.100
like when you have an idea,

1886
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:06.010
like a lot of times like Brian's don't love stand up to,

1887
01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.660
and he can back me up on this because he's,

1888
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.960
it's Brian and actually be a good person to talk about this with because he's
um,

1889
01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:14.940
he's relatively sort of new to comedy.
He,
he,

1890
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:19.080
he tried it a long time ago and it took a long time off and then it really

1891
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:22.990
jumped back in and start doing like bigger shows with us and doing a lot of

1892
01:51:22.991 --> 01:51:25.960
shows here so he knows what it's like.
So,
so tell him

1893
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.460
<v 7>about writing jokes.
Yeah,
I just,</v>

1894
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:33.010
pretty much something happens that I find funny.
Like I laugh and I'll go,

1895
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:35.110
that's pretty funny that,
and so I tried to,

1896
01:51:35.111 --> 01:51:39.370
I write it down in my notes and then later just kind of think I actually do it

1897
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.580
the wrong way.
I just kind of think of like an idea in my head,

1898
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:44.080
write down the notes so I remember it.

1899
01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.380
And then right before I go onstage and just kind of go like,
all right,

1900
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:48.850
am I talking about that?
All right,

1901
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:51.340
<v 0>well do you know that's not the wrong way you say it's the wrong way.</v>

1902
01:51:51.341 --> 01:51:55.240
It's not the wrong way because it's a pressure filled situation that sometimes

1903
01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:58.960
works.
Right.
You know,
I was on a Sitcom and the 90s,
it was his call,

1904
01:51:58.961 --> 01:52:00.720
it was called news radio and it was um,

1905
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:03.970
one of the most interesting things about it is the guy who created it,

1906
01:52:03.971 --> 01:52:07.600
this Guy Paul Sams,
really brilliant guy.
And um,

1907
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:11.710
one of the things he would do is they would not write anything until like three

1908
01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:12.544
in the morning.

1909
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:16.660
Like it was like at 10:00 AM they knew that there was going to be a table read,

1910
01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.040
but they had written shit.

1911
01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.710
There's like a few things written down in there farting on each other and

1912
01:52:20.711 --> 01:52:25.060
playing video games.
And then at like three in the morning they'd be like,
fuck,

1913
01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:26.450
we got to write this grant.

1914
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.670
And then they would write like 90% of the time,

1915
01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:32.590
maybe I'm going to be really honest,

1916
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.620
maybe 80% of the time it'd be absolutely fucking brilliant.

1917
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:38.650
20% of the time would just,
they would just,
they would,

1918
01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.600
there were too tired and they couldn't get through it.

1919
01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.640
This is how it goes get anyway.
Right?
Yeah.

1920
01:52:42.641 --> 01:52:47.450
But it's that pressure pressure of forcing yourself into a situation where

1921
01:52:47.451 --> 01:52:50.270
you're just going to go and talk about something and try to figure out what's

1922
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:53.540
funny.
Sometimes little things blossom out of that.

1923
01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:57.110
So you say it's the wrong way to do it,
but that's the way I,
I've done it.

1924
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:57.870
I think it's

1925
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:58.530
<v 7>good way to do it.</v>

1926
01:52:58.530 --> 01:53:01.770
And another thing is it's like taking these little things and then combining

1927
01:53:01.771 --> 01:53:02.910
them finding like,

1928
01:53:02.911 --> 01:53:06.570
like that's what I've been doing lately where I find find something funny and I

1929
01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:09.780
it on stage and I find something else funny to say onstage and then I've tried

1930
01:53:09.781 --> 01:53:11.730
to find a way to,
I could put those two things together,

1931
01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:14.450
no one and make a bigger one.
And it's kind of like,
I don't know,

1932
01:53:14.451 --> 01:53:15.990
it's like mine craft.

1933
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:18.710
<v 0>See the difference between us and you guys.</v>

1934
01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:23.000
I think a big part of it is that we need an audience to practice is very

1935
01:53:23.001 --> 01:53:26.430
important.
You can't practice with it.
I was just going to ask you that.
So yeah,

1936
01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:31.100
100% it's so important with the,
you know,
that's why I'm like,

1937
01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:36.110
so I always like go way out of my way to thank people and wait after shows and

1938
01:53:36.111 --> 01:53:39.860
take pictures of the people.
Like I can't even practice without them.

1939
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.750
I need them for the whole thing.

1940
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.530
The only thing that I could do is write concepts that I'm pretty sure funny,

1941
01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:50.480
but I need them to be there to craft it because there's a rhythm that you get in

1942
01:53:50.630 --> 01:53:52.280
when you have people's attention.

1943
01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:55.160
It's very different than the rhythm that you have when you're alone.
You know,

1944
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:57.470
you have to sort of like try to like replicate it,
you know,

1945
01:53:57.471 --> 01:54:01.880
as you're sitting alone.
But you guys can come up with a fucking awesome song,

1946
01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:04.610
you know,
and then just launch it,
you know,

1947
01:54:04.611 --> 01:54:08.600
at people and it's already done like whoa.
Like that's impossible for a comedian.

1948
01:54:08.601 --> 01:54:13.580
A comedian can only have like rough drafts.
You go up on stage at some,
some,

1949
01:54:13.610 --> 01:54:16.340
you know,
you have the ideas of how it's going to work and you sort of PR,

1950
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:19.280
I mean you have some punchlines that you've sorta preestablished in your hat of

1951
01:54:19.281 --> 01:54:23.660
being probable or profitable or you know,
hopeful.
You know,
like this,

1952
01:54:23.661 --> 01:54:26.090
this is going to fucking,
this is money baby,
you know,
you know,

1953
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:27.640
and then sometimes he dropped them and

1954
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:28.380
<v 7>work.</v>

1955
01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:31.250
There's also a lot of times where it seems like you feel like you want this bit

1956
01:54:31.251 --> 01:54:33.260
to work or your service and price.
It doesn't work.

1957
01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.550
You don't want to give up on it.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1958
01:54:35.730 --> 01:54:36.890
<v 0>And there's also sometimes we,</v>

1959
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:41.910
you say it once one time and it's just the perfect moment where the stars have

1960
01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:47.430
magically aligned and the rhythm of the room is correct and it's just,

1961
01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:51.630
they wanted to laugh at the right moment and they,
and it,
it,
it nailed it,

1962
01:54:51.631 --> 01:54:55.660
but it really wasn't that good.
And you gotta like,
you gotta let that Shit Cow.

1963
01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.271
Do you guys feel that?

1964
01:54:57.271 --> 01:54:59.940
What songs do you have songs that you get to a certain point in time when you're

1965
01:54:59.941 --> 01:55:03.630
like,
this is just going to throw this one away?
Yeah,
for sure.

1966
01:55:03.631 --> 01:55:05.030
We've let songs go alive.

1967
01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.930
<v 7>Courting is kind of like the,
uh,
the end all.</v>

1968
01:55:10.931 --> 01:55:13.420
I think that that's Kinda like the brick wall and everything gets thrown up

1969
01:55:13.421 --> 01:55:15.790
against and if it doesn't pass through it doesn't make it.

1970
01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:19.570
And we've had a lot of songs that have,
we've,
we've played regularly live.

1971
01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.220
And then when it comes down to recording it,

1972
01:55:21.221 --> 01:55:23.590
which means like confronting what you're actually playing,

1973
01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:25.350
then it doesn't make it through it,
you know.

1974
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:30.100
<v 0>What is the,
um,
the issue that you guys have with let's get wrecked?
The chorus,</v>

1975
01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:33.990
the chorus.
I don't think it's the chorus.
I think it's the,

1976
01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:37.820
I think it's the guitar playing.
Really
kidding.

1977
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.940
No,
it's,
you know,
we're,
we're reading I think,

1978
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.070
cause we liked

1979
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:47.580
<v 3>it at one point.
We were all fucking,
you know,
over the moon about it.</v>

1980
01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:51.060
But we're are just like,
you know,

1981
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:53.400
we were talking about jokes changing and things like that.
We're,

1982
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:54.990
we're going a little more,

1983
01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:59.100
we're getting a little harder and like just blues kind of,

1984
01:55:59.101 --> 01:56:01.950
and it's a little more,
I don't,

1985
01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:05.500
I don't want to say kitschy cause that's really insulting,
but it's more like,

1986
01:56:06.690 --> 01:56:10.530
it's almost like we need to make it a little more mature.
Does that sound okay?

1987
01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:13.420
<v 2>Well,
I feel like that record was a rush.
You know what I mean?
We,</v>

1988
01:56:13.421 --> 01:56:16.910
we had to make a record so we made this record and you know,

1989
01:56:16.911 --> 01:56:20.160
just like with jokes or with anything developed.
Yeah.
That,

1990
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:21.790
that was something that we,

1991
01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:26.620
we did in committed to and I don't regret doing it at all,
but you know,
at,

1992
01:56:26.621 --> 01:56:30.590
at this point,
you know,
given some time to marinade or whatever,

1993
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.420
wouldn't have made the same choices.
You know?

1994
01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.580
<v 0>I think that's a part of the process though.
Anything I completely,
absolutely.</v>

1995
01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.360
He kind of have to have stuff that's out there that doesn't really represent who

1996
01:56:39.361 --> 01:56:41.790
you are today,
otherwise you're not moving forward.
Yeah.

1997
01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:46.350
There's a lot of acts at a certain point in their careers.
They,
it becomes the,

1998
01:56:46.351 --> 01:56:50.730
the older stuff.
It represents like the best example of who we are.

1999
01:56:50.731 --> 01:56:53.160
And so they're not embarrassed about it at all.
In fact,

2000
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:55.200
they look at it nostalgically look,

2001
01:56:55.201 --> 01:56:57.300
that's back when they were really putting it together.

2002
01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.900
<v 2>That's a funny thing.
Sorry.
No,
you first.
All right,
well that's life,
right?
It is.</v>

2003
01:57:02.901 --> 01:57:06.530
But I feel like if I had a goal on how to live,
I would,

2004
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:10.430
I would make the good stuff come afterwards.
I think just,
I mean,

2005
01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:12.730
<v 0>the progression of the universe.
I mean that's,</v>

2006
01:57:12.731 --> 01:57:16.630
that's the sort of how it all works.
Well that's true.
Everything.

2007
01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:19.690
<v 3>Do you know,
I think it's,
it's good to be truthful with where you're at.</v>

2008
01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:23.410
Like I listened to our first record the other day for the first time in a long

2009
01:57:23.411 --> 01:57:27.930
time and I was like,
no.
Like I was embarrassed in my,

2010
01:57:28.150 --> 01:57:31.930
like in my weird,
like,
you know,
just analyzing myself and be like,
oh,
that was,

2011
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:33.130
I could have done this,
this and this.

2012
01:57:33.131 --> 01:57:36.790
And I seen it like this now and my voice is better now.
And,
but you know,

2013
01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:41.720
that's again,
that's,
that was,
that was my truth at the time.
And I think in,
in an,

2014
01:57:42.190 --> 01:57:46.930
for me goes so deep in,
in life in general,

2015
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:51.670
to be truthful with where you're at is a really rewarding thing.
And you know,

2016
01:57:51.671 --> 01:57:56.170
as an artist when you look back it's really easy to be hard on yourself.
But um,

2017
01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:01.450
you know,
to give myself a hard time is wasteful,

2018
01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:02.750
you know,
it's just good to just,

2019
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:07.870
<v 0>yeah,
you don't want to give yourself a hard time about the past.
But uh,
I,
it's,</v>

2020
01:58:07.871 --> 01:58:11.960
it's a,
that's a big part of why what you're doing right now is so good.

2021
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.771
It's like,

2022
01:58:12.771 --> 01:58:16.700
it all sort of like this sort of distaste for shit that doesn't sort of like

2023
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:19.670
really resonate with you or good.

2024
01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:24.410
It just feels like I'm faking this are forcing this or that sort of distaste is

2025
01:58:24.411 --> 01:58:27.140
what leads you to,
you know,
to greater heights.

2026
01:58:27.141 --> 01:58:31.940
Like this gross feeling is like so necessary.
It's like,
it's really,
you know,

2027
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.320
an order to have like such a depth to what you're saying,
what you're doing.

2028
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:40.190
You have to have gone through like a full spectrum of feelings and thoughts on

2029
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:43.210
things.
And I think that's what your,

2030
01:58:43.211 --> 01:58:48.010
your music resonates with like a lot of thinking like that La River Song,

2031
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:52.450
man,
that's,
that's another song really love.
It's like the lyrics are like,

2032
01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.490
it,
it,
it,
it speaks of someone who's thinking,
you know what I'm saying?

2033
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.353
It's not just,

2034
01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.410
you could say a certain amount of words in a row and it's just a song and a few

2035
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:05.950
things rhyme and,
and then neither clicks with my head or it doesn't,

2036
01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:09.610
but there's certain twists and turns in the narrative.

2037
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:13.030
There's certain twists and turns and how you're describing things that just,

2038
01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:16.780
you know,
as a,
as a,
as a person,
like that's like,

2039
01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:20.500
that's what you hope that you can do to somebody as a person.

2040
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:23.320
You hope that you could put something out there,
whatever the fuck it is.

2041
01:59:23.321 --> 01:59:26.170
It's your,
your apple cupcakes or

2042
01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:31.370
<v 1>you're fucking,
you know what I'm saying?
You get the mass back massages.
You know,</v>

2043
01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:35.000
whenever you fix a car better than anybody,
you just hope that

2044
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.310
<v 0>or another you knock someone on their ass like that La River song does.</v>

2045
01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.970
Electing a lot of your shit does.
It's a,

2046
01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:47.030
that what that represents to me is just like Miyamoto Musashi saying once you

2047
01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:52.480
understand the way you see it in all things,
once you see,

2048
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:56.710
once you see it in one thing,
once you understand it broadly,

2049
01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.330
you see it in all things.

2050
01:59:58.710 --> 02:00:03.490
<v 1>The idea said that too.
Everything is,
everything is the crazy,</v>

2051
02:00:05.110 --> 02:00:10.080
you know,
I don't know,
maybe I'm just trunk.
Definitely.
Definitely.

2052
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:14.160
You're very emotional,
emotional today,
right?
I'm on my period.

2053
02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.740
You're just,
you're,
you're,
you're totally in a different Joe that then you are,

2054
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:27.700
well,
you know,
I think,
I dunno man.
I just been thinking a lot lately about,
um,

2055
02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.030
the idea of a,

2056
02:00:29.130 --> 02:00:33.960
just the idea of sort of just interacting with human beings,

2057
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.790
you know,
and what it really all is,

2058
02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.980
<v 0>you know,
and how,
how bizarre it is that there's,</v>

2059
02:00:39.981 --> 02:00:41.030
there's a certain,

2060
02:00:41.090 --> 02:00:44.360
there's a certain thing that happens when we connect with people in a very

2061
02:00:44.361 --> 02:00:47.620
positive way and it's,
it's sort of an accelerant and it's sort of a,

2062
02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.600
a feeling of like everything is moving in the right direction.

2063
02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.430
<v 1>We all sort of instinctively know when that's happening.</v>

2064
02:00:53.431 --> 02:00:55.950
And that's like when I feel like when you guys are here,
when,
when you know,

2065
02:00:55.951 --> 02:00:58.470
when you guys are here and you're playing music and I'm like,
Holy Shit.

2066
02:00:58.471 --> 02:00:59.700
Like we put all this together.

2067
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:02.940
Like we didn't have anybody that helped us out here.
We put all this together.

2068
02:01:02.941 --> 02:01:06.630
I met you guys,
you know,
uh,
I talked about you online,

2069
02:01:06.631 --> 02:01:09.810
we talked back to each other,
balls of steel,
hooked it all up.

2070
02:01:10.110 --> 02:01:13.440
We go back and forth and then boom,
blood farts seven.

2071
02:01:13.441 --> 02:01:16.940
Thank you guys on a real guy.
Is it?
Yeah.

2072
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:23.670
It's kind of like there's this fabric of interesting connection between people

2073
02:01:23.671 --> 02:01:27.030
that the more you kind of sort of let it happen.

2074
02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:31.410
It's really an interesting experience in life.
Like people come in and they tend,

2075
02:01:31.411 --> 02:01:35.510
everybody's a part of it,
right?
It's a fucking hundred balls of steels out there.

2076
02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.170
All steel we're looking for you,
man,
is,
we're going to hold

2077
02:01:40.290 --> 02:01:44.210
<v 4>the part about it.
With that in mind,
there's a hundred or more,</v>

2078
02:01:44.211 --> 02:01:46.700
way more than that.
Incredible bands.
You know what I mean?

2079
02:01:46.701 --> 02:01:49.370
Our position playing incredible.
How many guys are like you out there.

2080
02:01:49.371 --> 02:01:53.090
Be honest with packs out there and there's none.
There's only one.

2081
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:56.690
Ben Jaffe and I'm sorry,
I'm going to test it out.
This man is a one of them.

2082
02:01:56.691 --> 02:02:00.300
I mean like if you're not a standup comedy fan the first time you ever come to a

2083
02:02:00.301 --> 02:02:03.500
comedy club,
I bet he is.
He's a smart guy.
Sorry.

2084
02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:05.930
<v 0>Well you can like Musashi said,</v>

2085
02:02:05.931 --> 02:02:08.600
concentrate on that and I'm sure you'd be a great comedian if that's what your

2086
02:02:08.601 --> 02:02:11.780
calling was,
have you,
if you,
I really think that's really what it is.

2087
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:12.950
I mean everyone,
you know,
your,

2088
02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:16.160
your certain did essences of the various ingredients of your personality.

2089
02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:17.870
It might lead you in one direction or the other.

2090
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:21.080
But I really believed that if you had chosen to be great at anything,

2091
02:02:21.081 --> 02:02:22.690
that you'd be great at anything.
If you,
if you

2092
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.090
<v 4>hip national basketball,
right?
Maybe not.
Maybe not me,
but I'm not,
I,</v>

2093
02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:30.730
I before,
I don't think we knew everyone,

2094
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:35.260
what people called talent on thinks it's a specific thing,
I think is a focus.
Um,

2095
02:02:35.290 --> 02:02:36.250
you know,
it is a little bit,
yeah,

2096
02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:41.060
<v 0>but this is certain dudes that are talented in a strange,
bizarre ways,
you know,</v>

2097
02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.660
physically talented,
especially like athletes.
There's some,

2098
02:02:43.661 --> 02:02:47.860
I've met athletes like there is no way you can't tell that they're absolutely

2099
02:02:47.861 --> 02:02:50.800
physically talented and gifted.
If they're not normal people,

2100
02:02:50.890 --> 02:02:51.970
they can do weird shit.

2101
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.730
They can jump through the air way higher than anybody in a good run quicker than

2102
02:02:54.731 --> 02:02:58.510
anybody.
They grab you at stronger.
This is no getting around that,
you know.

2103
02:02:58.511 --> 02:02:58.871
So there's,

2104
02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:01.570
there's a certain amount of like physical and athletic talent at a certain

2105
02:03:01.571 --> 02:03:03.940
amount of like vocal talent.
I can't sing at all.

2106
02:03:03.941 --> 02:03:05.590
I'll never be able to say I my voice.

2107
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.820
<v 3>You have a voice.
Do you know what I mean?
Like there's,</v>

2108
02:03:07.821 --> 02:03:12.740
there's a difference and it's not a difference.
Actually.
I think that,
um,
Oh God,

2109
02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.420
this is really intense and I'm like candy,
but I kind of want to say this.

2110
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:21.950
I think when people have these,
um,
these gifts in life,

2111
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:24.810
whether it's athleticism or,
um,

2112
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:29.990
just a brilliant mind or you know,
martial arts or acting or music,

2113
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:31.400
whatever,
um,

2114
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:35.930
there's always an opportunity for an awareness of the other people around you

2115
02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:38.930
and how you connect to them with these gifts.

2116
02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:42.120
And I think some people have theirs,

2117
02:03:42.190 --> 02:03:44.510
it's a closed door and it's just their gift in their,

2118
02:03:44.511 --> 02:03:46.070
maybe their ego or whatever.

2119
02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:50.870
And then there's the other people that just understand that it's all part of a

2120
02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.480
bigger thing.
Like,
you know,
there's a,

2121
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.770
I think there's a reason that you're able to reach over a half million people

2122
02:03:58.090 --> 02:04:01.130
cause you,
you have a lot to say and you know,
you're not,

2123
02:04:01.131 --> 02:04:06.020
you're not spreading bad things.
You're,
you're,
you're having,
you have ideas and

2124
02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.360
<v 0>you don't want what you son is really interesting because like in a one on one</v>

2125
02:04:10.361 --> 02:04:12.430
competition sense that they're,

2126
02:04:12.431 --> 02:04:16.270
the only problem with that is that like a lot of life is competition and in

2127
02:04:16.271 --> 02:04:19.960
competition a lot of times a pace to be selfish.
Right.
You know,

2128
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:24.630
there's a very interesting way of looking at life like in,
in,

2129
02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.720
in terms of looking at it like a competition or looking like it is as you have

2130
02:04:28.721 --> 02:04:29.770
to be competitive,

2131
02:04:29.771 --> 02:04:33.610
but at the same time we're all somehow or another a part of the same thing.

2132
02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:37.060
That's a weird sort of a differentiation that a lot of people have a really

2133
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.670
difficult time.
You know,

2134
02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:42.090
it takes like a lot of life experience to sort of put that together.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2135
02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.030
You know,
and if you're a person who's like a competitive person,

2136
02:04:45.031 --> 02:04:46.920
especially at a young age,
it takes,

2137
02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.780
it's a lot of conditioning to get past the idea of like looking out 100% for

2138
02:04:51.781 --> 02:04:53.280
you,
only for you.

2139
02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:58.320
And like everybody else could potentially be an enemy or a,
an opponent now.

2140
02:04:58.321 --> 02:05:01.170
So it's,
uh,
I think for,
uh,
do you,

2141
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:06.120
do you find that there's a lot of competition like amongst a fellow bands and a

2142
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:08.580
lot of like weird shit that goes on?
Like,

2143
02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:11.680
<v 3>you know,
I think if you look at it like that,
you're already at,</v>

2144
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.050
you're leading with a handicap,
you know,

2145
02:05:14.051 --> 02:05:18.400
because that's not what it's about for me.
I'll speak for myself.

2146
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:21.980
I'm of course not right.
But I mean,
it's

2147
02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:23.870
<v 4>not just a little bit of a,</v>

2148
02:05:23.871 --> 02:05:27.740
Polo did this little bit of a jealous worlds that exists.
You know what I mean?

2149
02:05:27.741 --> 02:05:30.500
There's the world that we get to do what we want and create the music that we

2150
02:05:30.501 --> 02:05:34.310
want,
but then there's the world that we have to survive as a business.

2151
02:05:34.311 --> 02:05:36.170
You know what I mean?
And that is a competition.

2152
02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:38.120
<v 3>But the,
the bands that,</v>

2153
02:05:38.121 --> 02:05:41.300
if you were potentially to call them competition are usually people I really

2154
02:05:41.301 --> 02:05:43.880
admire.
So there's a,
there's a shift.

2155
02:05:43.881 --> 02:05:47.720
If you're going from a defensive standpoint,
you're already going to lose,

2156
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:50.960
you know,
and I don't,
I don't feel safe that way.
That's like a,

2157
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:53.840
that's a weird way to live your life,
you know?
And,

2158
02:05:53.841 --> 02:05:57.430
and so when you just embrace like,
like inspiration,
like you,

2159
02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:00.260
I love that you keep saying that we inspire you.
That's such an honor.

2160
02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.480
And I feel like that about people that could,

2161
02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:04.910
one could potentially call our competition,

2162
02:06:04.911 --> 02:06:07.970
but I don't view them that way because I respect them.

2163
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:09.150
<v 0>My friend Paul Mooney,</v>

2164
02:06:09.151 --> 02:06:13.710
he's a standup comedian that's old school stand up comedian used to write for a

2165
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.560
Richard Pryor back in the day.
Like how much is a great guy?

2166
02:06:16.710 --> 02:06:17.700
And one of the things,
you know,

2167
02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:21.270
he's like tell a bunch of young comedians once he's like,
go be entertained.

2168
02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.260
Just go out to go be in a tact.
Yeah.
You know,

2169
02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:27.300
and I didn't even think about that until I tell Paul said that.

2170
02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:32.060
And then now I like consciously go look to be entertained and that's swear.

2171
02:06:32.061 --> 02:06:33.690
I was so excited about seeing you

2172
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:37.420
<v 4>guys
were all bad.</v>

2173
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:42.570
I feel like that's what you're saying.
That'd be ability to be,

2174
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:45.900
to compete without feeling threatened.
You know what I mean?
Because that's not,

2175
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:48.330
well it'd be off the tiny or it can be a healthy thing.

2176
02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:50.700
I think it's a very helpful thing.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2177
02:06:50.701 --> 02:06:52.950
It's like is listening to your old shit that sucks

2178
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:58.800
cause it fucking gets you going.
God,
