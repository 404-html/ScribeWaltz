<v Speaker 1>What do you mean how you think?</v>

9
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the UFC and may were there come to an agreement?</v>

10
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.210

<v Speaker 1>I might have.</v>

22
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to happen,</v>

23
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

24
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.841
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

25
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.591
<v Speaker 1>You really think so.</v>

26
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:35.424
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

27
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And you're asking me to come to own it.</v>

28
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>So let's just figure this out.</v>

29
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to talk to you?</v>

30
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Just what do you do to probably companion?</v>

31
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

32
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

33
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

34
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>While if you're not commentating,</v>

35
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we need you like giant companion for it and celebrate the shit out of it.</v>

36
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer that.</v>

37
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

38
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>June 10th June 10th it's about to get a lot of my man may whether throws you</v>

39
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>that TMT money.</v>

40
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they really care about me commentating.</v>

41
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably want Max Kellerman or of the boxing people.</v>

42
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Max Kellerman you boom.</v>

43
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It would be fun.</v>

44
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I would love to do it with them.</v>

45
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I,</v>

46
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

47
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a boxing match,</v>

48
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>that's their world.</v>

50
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was him and a manager though and he was sitting down next to me doing</v>

51
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.754
<v Speaker 1>commentary,</v>

52
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>you know that I think that would be a little odd to not a Floyd was just doing</v>

53
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>boxing the octagon.</v>

54
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

55
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You need to be an awesome,</v>

56
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.681
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

57
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.381
<v Speaker 1>no I'm saying if,</v>

58
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>if the roles were reversed,</v>

59
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you could talk about moving Connor's history cause they,</v>

60
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to know shit.</v>

61
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's be right.</v>

62
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.991
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>

63
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you know Shannon Sharpe talking about UFC,</v>

64
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to listen to.</v>

65
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be good at on who's knowledgeable breakdown like commerce history,</v>

66
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.151
<v Speaker 1>how he came here.</v>

67
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>He got his movement,</v>

68
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>what he's known for.</v>

69
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that's super important.</v>

70
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to forgive people who don't watch UFC.</v>

71
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're getting a shit load of new boxing.</v>

73
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:50.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>it sounds fast.</v>

75
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Tune in,</v>

76
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with you guys.</v>

77
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:53.671
<v Speaker 1>Smoking weed,</v>

78
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.481
<v Speaker 1>watching it right here.</v>

79
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so much better.</v>

80
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>I just want my dear friend Joe Rogan,</v>

81
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>part of the biggest fight of combat and history.</v>

82
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

83
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a big deal right here.</v>

84
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't think that's the biggest fight in his life.</v>

85
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Fighting history bigger than Ali Frazier.</v>

86
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

87
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.931
<v Speaker 1>Number wise.</v>

88
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest,</v>

91
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>biggest paper view ever because it brings in two worlds.</v>

92
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>It brings in the UFC world and this one guy who was unquestionably the biggest</v>

93
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>star in the UFC,</v>

94
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably by a long shot.</v>

95
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you bring in a guy who has been one of the biggest moneymakers in the</v>

96
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.321
<v Speaker 1>history of boxing,</v>

97
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>changed the game.</v>

98
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>The only guy to go 49 and no others in rocky Marciano.</v>

99
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's like right there and we'd love to break rocky Marciano's record.</v>

100
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what,</v>

101
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:34.111
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

102
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>when people want to do things like break someone's record and you want to do it</v>

103
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>so bad that you take on a guy who's never had a boxing match before and then</v>

104
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>that guy starches,</v>

105
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:43.614
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

106
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>know saying,</v>

107
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like does that,</v>

108
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build a shrine to him,</v>

109
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 1>pray to whatever this summer I'm going to get a tattoo.</v>

110
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.601
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

111
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

112
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that dude.</v>

113
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>He's got something going on.</v>

114
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:55.351
<v Speaker 1>Magic.</v>

115
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>He's got a little something extra special,</v>

116
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.074
<v Speaker 1>but he would need,</v>

117
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>he would everything to line up.</v>

118
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be the McGregor Mayweather would have to dismiss him as a</v>

119
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

120
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>He'd have to not train hard enough.</v>

121
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>He'd have to not seriously consider the possibility that Connor connects on him</v>

122
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Speaker 1>and knocks him out.</v>

123
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

124
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And then Connor would have to do some rough housing.</v>

125
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.690
<v Speaker 1>He would have to hold him.</v>

126
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>He'd have to hold them and hit 'em.</v>

127
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to try to get off as many shots and bullying around and wear him out.</v>

128
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a possibility.</v>

129
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a possibility.</v>

130
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>He's a much bigger mass.</v>

131
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>He's a much quicker manner.</v>

132
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.151
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

134
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:31.691
<v Speaker 1>very quick.</v>

135
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>But if you compare the two of them frame wise,</v>

136
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>like what if they ever do do it and they're standing right at each other looking</v>

137
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>down at each other,</v>

138
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.341
<v Speaker 1>do an eye to eye,</v>

140
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go,</v>

141
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.683
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

142
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Connor's way.</v>

144
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Because you remember when Eddie Alvarez was going Idi with Connor and you</v>

145
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>realize how big Connor's head is.</v>

146
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>He'll like Jesus,</v>

147
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>we're just a bigger dude.</v>

148
00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause from shoulders,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a big fuck.</v>

151
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could make that 145 pound cut when he was on death's door,</v>

152
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.041
<v Speaker 1>but may,</v>

153
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>whether it makes it easy,</v>

154
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to fight at 45 that's a good question.</v>

155
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

157
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet they do it like 55 or 60 maybe.</v>

158
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

159
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what may was comfortable with,</v>

160
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:08.660

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

162
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.753

<v Speaker 1>and Dana White,</v>

164

<v Speaker 1>you want to be part of that fight.</v>

165
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're Dana let you want to be in cahoots with all these guys with</v>

166
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.413

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.910

<v Speaker 1>making that weight,</v>

174
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>then Neuroma Madoff and Tony Ferguson,</v>

175
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.933
