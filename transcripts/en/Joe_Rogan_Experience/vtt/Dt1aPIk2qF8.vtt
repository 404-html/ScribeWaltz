7
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it just went off air and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything came back on by itself.</v>

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took it with his friends.</v>

11
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't feel anything so like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But then he didn't want to be the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>left out so I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>take some.</v>

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And then he realized he could for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

16
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 1>like years and years could actually sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with those legs and arms like </v>

17
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 1>cramping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Sean Rouse.</v>

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it could help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's no way that </v>

19
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>guy does not smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

20
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>no it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't smoke weed.</v>

21
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>You would think that doug would smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed.</v>

22
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Stan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope does not.</v>

23
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done a few mushrooms,</v>

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope we did DMT.</v>

25
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>He'll go to other dimensions like pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>banks and paranoia and isn't like the </v>

26
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>negative side effects of everything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>The paranoia that pot gives you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

28
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the opposite of alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol makes you look through a</v>

29
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol.</v>

30
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>You like looking at the world through A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>To seeing marijuana's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana,</v>

32
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>like your blinders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it in front of me,</v>

33
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went off and on for a second.</v>

34
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>It blipped today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you guys know.</v>

35
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking it up.</v>

36
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Use Dreams just fucking operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't see red band,</v>

37
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>he's actually speaking into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

38
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

39
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:46.371
<v Speaker 1>don't be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is difficult to figure out the </v>

40
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:46.371
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

41
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have this on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Joe Rogan Dot Knapp,</v>

42
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>but right now I don't think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology's available.</v>

43
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is ideally the best way to do a</v>

44
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

45
00:01:55.141 --> 00:02:00.141
<v Speaker 1>This is way more fun and doing some some</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that's on television that nobody </v>

46
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:00.141
<v Speaker 1>gives a shit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is what we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck we want.</v>

48
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything from you.</v>

49
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>No one's getting paid just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>and you have interesting people over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk and write.</v>

51
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the matter Brown girl blaming me,</v>

52
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian and the cone in and like a talk </v>

53
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:29.511
<v Speaker 1>show and it's like you prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big deal and then you sit </v>

54
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>down and talk to someone for like seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and you're like,</v>

55
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we get to talk about anything?</v>

56
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had a few topics that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>got out of the way a little bit,</v>

57
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but barely 70 thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in every one of those shows are</v>

58
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>set up for that reason that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

59
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You just leave there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that was nothing.</v>

60
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Anything I didn't even know it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great appearance.</v>

61
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Didn't say two words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're a Chelsea handler's </v>

62
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.721
<v Speaker 1>show the those guys down there say like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five words and then you're done </v>

63
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>and then they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

65
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>

00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a great.</v>

67
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Short attention span,</v>

68
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

69
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 2>See this guy real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

70
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the if you want to go for like,</v>

71
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go for like the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.980

<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

73
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what you should give them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should give them the shortest,</v>

74
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>quickest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little things as fast as you can so they</v>

75
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.100
<v Speaker 2>don't lose interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

76
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>You want the people that lose interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that easy to pay attention to,</v>

77
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.230

<v Speaker 2>know doing a numbers game because.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean how many times have you seen a </v>

79
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.260
<v Speaker 2>youtube clip and you start to open it </v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to start over all </v>

82
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a youtube clip is totally </v>

83
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>different than something like this.</v>

84
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like cool because you can throw </v>

<v Speaker 2>thing at work.</v>

87
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 2>You could throw this on and watch it </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you do it and just enjoy a bunch </v>

88
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 2>of people hanging around talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked doing that.</v>

191
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who worked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked,</v>

192
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 4>he played for the Detroit lions when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was in Detroit,</v>

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>and that happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the two girls back at his place,</v>

194
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Super Nice Guy.</v>

195
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we could do is we could say that </v>

<v Speaker 4>she said it as a joke,</v>

198
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.180
<v Speaker 4>so immediately said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go knock on his neighbor's door </v>

199
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.540

<v Speaker 4>So we'd have one other person to see </v>

201
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 4>their condition when they left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they couldn't that make up the story.</v>

202
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 4>And I had another famous friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>

203
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 4>every time you hook up with a girl in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the room,</v>

204
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 4>he was like way famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd go to the front desk girl,</v>

205
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 4>he'd walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that girl,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he would stop.</v>

207
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 4>So talk to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was one other person I'd see.</v>

208
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.470

<v Speaker 1>making a living,</v>

230
00:10:55.491 --> 00:11:00.491
<v Speaker 1>doing something negative and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do that sort of negative because</v>

231
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they call those people </v>

233
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.350
<v Speaker 1>but when you're chasing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's upset with you,</v>

234
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>like they have their kids or something </v>

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It'll never look like a casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

250
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I love how John Travolta rocks a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous wig,</v>

255
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.460
<v Speaker 4>The TMZ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw one of the guys who works on Tmz </v>

256
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.221
<v Speaker 4>and one of the guys so we saw so and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the airport and I wanted to go up to </v>

257
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:11.881
<v Speaker 4>them so bad with the camera and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sticking it in his face and ask some </v>

258
00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:14.791
<v Speaker 4>dumb questions and I probably could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>sold that back to Tom because I wanted </v>

259
00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:18.250
<v Speaker 4>to do as a sketch that will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go fucking guy that does tmc.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he has like his sippy cup that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no one that's watched.</v>

262
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.170
<v Speaker 4>It's evil because those guys are making </v>
<v Speaker 4>fun of people that are on tv yet every </v>

263
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:31.710
<v Speaker 4>one of them wants to be so</v>

264
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.020
<v Speaker 1>famous and is enjoying all the fame </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting from being on the show.</v>

265
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.310
<v Speaker 1>But that's legitimate too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people liked the way the </v>

266
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.960
<v Speaker 1>bitchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they wish they could be that bitchy</v>

267
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and they liked watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a form of energy.</v>

268
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what the Chelsea handler show </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to shit on people where you wished we</v>

269
00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 1>could work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

272
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.270
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place for that too.</v>

273
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as like rich people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get upset at,</v>

274
00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:58.880
<v Speaker 1>at poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are not famous.</v>

275
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 1>They like and pick out going after </v>
<v Speaker 1>target woods,</v>

276

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go find him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>

278
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Like some woman actually said this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jimmy Kimmel show.</v>

279
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was uh,</v>

280
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.730

<v Speaker 1>find people's houses and,</v>

281
00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

282
00:13:11.271 --> 00:13:12.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was um,</v>

283
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you would say where the celebrity is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any given moment and understand that </v>

284
00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:20.270
<v Speaker 1>there's like stockers and this can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

285
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

286
00:13:21.231 --> 00:13:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that their sleep well on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.840
<v Speaker 1>all their money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bag full of money.</v>

289
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

290
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're willing to put the Poles.</v>

291
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put people.</v>

292
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Especially young girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:37.100
<v Speaker 1>some dudes get fucking really nutty </v>
<v Speaker 1>about young girls.</v>

294
00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that one girl that got shot,</v>

295
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.140
<v Speaker 1>it was like when I first came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>

296
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>some girl got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on a of shocker even </v>

297
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.760
<v Speaker 1>understanding how a black hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was really pretty.</v>

298
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It was like a childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not childhood star,</v>

299
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:56.801
<v Speaker 1>but like 22 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She become famous when she was like </v>

300
00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 1>young and some dude just got obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her,</v>

301
00:13:57.771 --> 00:13:59.600
<v Speaker 1>found out where she lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She opened the door,</v>

302
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:00.500
<v Speaker 1>he shot her in the chest.</v>

303
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.030
<v Speaker 4>How scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like stock,</v>

304
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 4>because out when I used to do radio in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Detroit,</v>

305
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.380
<v Speaker 4>this girl within me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>

306
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.420
<v Speaker 4>16 page letters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not one piece of white left on the </v>

307
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.230
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was written sideways anyway about.</v>

308
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I had fun going out with you looking for</v>
<v Speaker 4>houses.</v>

309
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Shit that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

310
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.520
<v Speaker 4>I heard about your secret messages that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are not.</v>

311
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.530
<v Speaker 4>And then she went away and then she came</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and every time I'd be in Detroit </v>

312
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.170
<v Speaker 4>she would leave these letters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When your life's gone and it's just us </v>

313
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy stuff.</v>

314
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:36.301
<v Speaker 4>So I went to go get a restraining order </v>
<v Speaker 4>against her because she was showing up </v>

315
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:38.730
<v Speaker 4>at my shows and what we'll find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I would be in the judge.</v>

316
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:38.850
<v Speaker 4>What</v>

317
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>did you fuck her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

318
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

319
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

320
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

321
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just trying to think how far back was </v>

322
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No was it</v>

324
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 4>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been about 10,</v>

325
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 4>15 years and the guy wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The judge would not get what she wanted.</v>

326
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.620
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to hear her side of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I had a stack of papers this big of </v>

327
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 4>her saying she came to the radio station</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked at with some of my stuff.</v>

328
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.790
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Leftists.</v>

329
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 4>It was an empty can of tuna fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

330
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Junk mail and baby shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then she got to your house.</v>

331
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

332
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 4>this was from her place I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I had stacks of letters saying,</v>

333
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 4>I hear the secret messages that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving me.</v>

334
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I will respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say this,</v>

335
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:31.301
<v Speaker 4>it means this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you go to file a restraining </v>

336
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:31.301
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the judge,</v>

337
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 4>you get less than a paragraph to write </v>
<v Speaker 4>why you don't get the hand in any of the</v>

338
00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:36.790
<v Speaker 4>psycho stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>

339
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.810
<v Speaker 4>And then he saw that and then the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who did it for him,</v>

340
00:15:39.811 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a dude,</v>

341
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 4>he probably thinks you're a pussy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can handle the.</v>

342
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Just know that because I'm a guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had this girl stocker.</v>

343
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 4>The judge thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

344
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a guy.</v>

345
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Handled the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't bring us involved.</v>

346
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.750
<v Speaker 4>It was his attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

347

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

406
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Situations where they say if they're </v>

<v Speaker 2>but if they came into my house then then</v>

613
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Jb?</v>

614
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.560
<v Speaker 2>their house and introducing little kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Michael Jackson,</v>

615
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.440
<v Speaker 2>so that's a way bigger problem.</v>

616
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Introducing these children that are on </v>

617
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.150
<v Speaker 2>the make a wish foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a mega list or something like</v>

618
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:13.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sick.</v>

619
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 2>He was introducing them to Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson.</v>

620
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.270
<v Speaker 2>You're saying introducing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say pimping,</v>

621
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.700
<v Speaker 2>pimping his genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't know what the fuck that </v>

622
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.521
<v Speaker 2>ass I spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that Michael Jackson fuck </v>

623
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:32.590
<v Speaker 2>those kids because I think where are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies there?</v>

624
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Speaker 2>There'll be not just one kitty fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be fucking hundreds.</v>

625
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably eight to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he did.</v>

626
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that we </v>

627
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.331
<v Speaker 2>talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that a </v>

628
00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:50.930
<v Speaker 2>WHO's just completely fucked up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was molested when he was a kid and </v>

629
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:55.461
<v Speaker 2>abused and he grew up in the public eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he grew up as a baby and like being </v>

630
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>a drug user and just kind of had I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the power of huge rumors and </v>

631
00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I terrible in the ass.</v>

632
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:08.751
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that one going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of that theory says other </v>

718
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.410
<v Speaker 2>To find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see</v>

719
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.830
<v Speaker 5>where I'm wearing a little intention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's all that.</v>

720
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.400
<v Speaker 5>Why would you want to look at this</v>

721
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.260
<v Speaker 6>to hold it?</v>

722
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 5>Why would you want me to back it up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

723
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you like to name it though?</v>

724
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was real cocky.</v>

725
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.930
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't watch Hulu that.</v>

726
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's been injecting silicone in it was </v>

727
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.220
<v Speaker 5>dick or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we get hard?</v>

728
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.800
<v Speaker 5>Is that all head on topic?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they look at it.</v>

729
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.090
<v Speaker 5>So that's all that is.</v>

730
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.480
<v Speaker 6>Hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Should I continue?</v>

731
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how we're.</v>

732
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.620
<v Speaker 5>Could it be he's injecting silicone into</v>
<v Speaker 5>his fucking.</v>

733
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

734
00:34:56.411 --> 00:34:57.310
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>

735
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Six years of injecting silicon of is six</v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

736
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.220
<v Speaker 5>It's unlikely he's unable to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

737
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 5>You really think I'd like to fuck his </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>

738
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.580
<v Speaker 5>I was listening to pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The adventure and the experience that </v>

739
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:23.480
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten from this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way,</v>

740
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:28.481
<v Speaker 5>way better than whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes of pleasure that I would </v>

741
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:33.791
<v Speaker 5>guess what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has he gotten experience in this </v>

742
00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:38.770
<v Speaker 5>deck and no longer stand up to pee </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it would just kind of go </v>

743
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 5>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

744
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 5>it was difficult to control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I started learning about,</v>

745
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:47.121
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to sit down and I'll tell you </v>

746
00:35:47.121 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 5>about some other adjustments in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second play of these adjustments.</v>

747
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:52.491
<v Speaker 5>So they just add to the excitement for </v>
<v Speaker 5>me because it's just another reminder </v>

748
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 5>and it's part of the Odyssey of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of all of this,</v>

749
00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:00.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was sitting down to pee for a long </v>

750
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.780
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then the size got to be that when I</v>

751
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 5>would sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd get wet.</v>

752
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.480
<v Speaker 5>It would get dumped into the water and </v>
<v Speaker 5>toilets concluding my own.</v>

753
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 5>And so I would have sort of squat over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ball.</v>

754
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:15.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

755
00:36:15.701 --> 00:36:20.701
<v Speaker 5>I think that just the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at me and either wonder what's </v>

756
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that,</v>

757
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the basic questions that people ask,</v>

758
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.680
<v Speaker 5>can you still have an orgasm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things like that.</v>

759
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

760
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:36.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting people to think and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenging their ideas of what a </v>

761
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.320
<v Speaker 5>payments should look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

762

<v Speaker 5>should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

763
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 5>function and so challenging.</v>

764
00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Giving them a challenge to down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gauntlet bitch.</v>

765
00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.400
<v Speaker 5>The crazy thing is attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1007
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.930
<v Speaker 1>that all this is a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's not gonna be any more war to</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna go to war again and </v>

1009
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.430
<v Speaker 1>then when I was like 21 was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulf war,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the fucking the first trial to happen </v>

1014
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.290

<v Speaker 1>and bombs going off and I was like,</v>

1015

<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1019
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 4>I remember being in college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the two guys I lived with are all </v>

1020
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.770
<v Speaker 4>reservists and then they got called up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they were probably 20,</v>

1021
00:48:48.771 --> 00:48:53.771
<v Speaker 4>21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty two got called up and went down </v>

1022
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:54.320

1023
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.780
<v Speaker 4>At the time everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just give me a draft.</v>

1024
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna be a draft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we all thought because we were that </v>

1025
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 4>at that age we were 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>21.</v>

1026
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:02.420
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy crap,</v>

1027
00:49:02.421 --> 00:49:05.240
<v Speaker 4>we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a serious.</v>

1028
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 4>So scary man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when the first Gulf War </v>

1030
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.311
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're practicing basketball and it was </v>

1031
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:18.131
<v Speaker 4>the opening night of some play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some high school player and somebody </v>

1032
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:18.131
<v Speaker 4>came in and like the play bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plane,</v>

1033
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:22.600
<v Speaker 4>the plane's bond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I just learned to play bombed while </v>

1034
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.010
<v Speaker 4>you're breaking up our practice for the.</v>

1035
00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a little happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

1036
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.590
<v Speaker 1>So surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got woken up,</v>

1037
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who woke me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody called me and told me that </v>

1038
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Americans are Americans under attack and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1039
00:49:41.211 --> 00:49:46.211
<v Speaker 1>why turn the news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is under attack and we just are </v>

1040
00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:50.021
<v Speaker 1>so removed from all this shit and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on and the rest of the world we are</v>

1041
00:49:50.271 --> 00:49:55.271
<v Speaker 1>so removed from what war really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you've talked to someone who's </v>

1042
00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:59.201
<v Speaker 1>actually been over there and come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a very different opinion </v>

1043
00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:01.691
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're so fucking removed from it </v>

1044
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:01.691
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that shit on tv,</v>

1045
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:02.060

<v Speaker 1>It was like your heart starts beating </v>

1048
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:10.691
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden this team </v>

1051
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:16.751
<v Speaker 1>but it's like we're all in this team </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and then you don't think about </v>

1052
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:19.991
<v Speaker 1>that three a day to day life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say you're happy to be an </v>

1053
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:20.930
<v Speaker 1>American shit and you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and I'm Republican,</v>

1054
00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really realize you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some team until teams attack and then </v>

1055
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:31.541
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that did nothing due to didn't know </v>

1056
00:50:31.541 --> 00:50:34.751
<v Speaker 1>these dudes came over and killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because they were living on this </v>

1057
00:50:34.751 --> 00:50:38.610
<v Speaker 1>spark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were living in this patch of dirt </v>

1058
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:38.610
<v Speaker 1>so people were killing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1059

<v Speaker 1>I thought that was the only movie shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brother's over there now is he just </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go through a tour,</v>

1063
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:53.910
<v Speaker 1>if you sign up for the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney instituted some new </v>

1064
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.871
<v Speaker 1>situation where they can just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep bringing you back when they still </v>

1065
00:50:57.871 --> 00:51:01.471
<v Speaker 1>an active reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he knows eventually got called up </v>

1066
00:51:01.471 --> 00:51:03.691
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they were in a situation where </v>

1067
00:51:03.691 --> 00:51:03.691
<v Speaker 1>people floors and they were bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back.</v>

1068
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh.</v>

1069
00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Randall Masker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long are you going to ask the same </v>

1070
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:11.010
<v Speaker 3>question over and over and over again.</v>

1071
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Some dude ask him a question over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

1072
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it 10 times more women by you </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading it.</v>

1073
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Are we rewarding him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1074
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 2>when people ignore you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you ever make a joke like in </v>

1075
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.731
<v Speaker 2>public and nobody laughs and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear somebody like make the same job </v>

1076
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:37.811
<v Speaker 2>again because I assumed nobody heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>them look at their response and fucking </v>

1077
00:51:37.811 --> 00:51:39.390
<v Speaker 2>take that to me and they didn't find it </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

1078
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.380
<v Speaker 2>The worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone thinks you weren't listening</v>

1079
00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and they say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that means.</v>

1080
00:51:43.591 --> 00:51:46.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not in the moment trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>this job.</v>

1081
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:50.460
<v Speaker 2>There's all the branches other than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>army are overloaded.</v>

1082
00:51:50.461 --> 00:51:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Actually believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1083
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.100
<v Speaker 2>now I think he's probably telling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1084
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I would think that in this economy I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say was a lot.</v>

1085
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people.</v>

1086
00:52:00.371 --> 00:52:01.780
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot higher than</v>

1087
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 3>look at what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long?</v>

1088
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago,</v>

1194
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:19.211
<v Speaker 2>climax at the end was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because some teacher taught them in the </v>

1195
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:21.920
<v Speaker 2>clear move to the rest of the movie that</v>

1196
00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:24.050

<v Speaker 1>like he's got all these different.</v>

1212
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many times I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must've had concussions.</v>

1213
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's a big guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays football.</v>

1214
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets concussions playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>football right now,</v>

1215
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 1>a quarterback who's had the most simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ever,</v>

1216
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:33.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's coordinated.</v>

1217
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Blindside hits all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was standing there with my fucking </v>

1218
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.440
<v Speaker 1>crushed them helmet the helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anytime you get hit,</v>

1219
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:47.130
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not getting a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of getting fucking </v>

1220
00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.951
<v Speaker 1>rattled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you get up and you get back up </v>

1221
00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 1>when you get smashed into by some giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who's a full clip,</v>

1222
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:57.270
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't go out and either if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a concussion where like </v>

1223
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.270
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pupils are dilated,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's reality.</v>

1227
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that shit over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again,</v>

1228
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 1>football is one of the most</v>

1229
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.350
<v Speaker 2>rothenberger last week and that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been about this burger.</v>

1230
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Was there a big quarterback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it was like,</v>

1231
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.400
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>neck tackle?</v>

1233
00:59:15.741 --> 00:59:20.741
<v Speaker 2>And then he just got blindsided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them on the ground with the </v>

1234
00:59:20.741 --> 00:59:23.711
<v Speaker 2>train is over him and he's like talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can clearly see he's not making </v>

1235
00:59:23.711 --> 00:59:23.711
<v Speaker 2>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1236
00:59:23.711 --> 00:59:23.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1241
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:38.960
<v Speaker 4>We were sparring in and I kind of went </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1242
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:41.060
<v Speaker 4>but he said it was the slowest knockout </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

1243
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to one knee and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you okay?</v>

1298
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Tim sylvia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought,</v>

1299
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>randy coture.</v>

1301
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>When tim silvia got cracked in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>

1302
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he woke up going into the fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know around was he thought the</v>

1303
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:55.571
<v Speaker 1>second one was the fourth round or we </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the fourth round was the second </v>

1304
01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:55.571
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was off by three.</v>

1305
01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>missed fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've been the fifth </v>

1306
01:01:59.650 --> 01:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>because he told them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the last round.</v>

1307
01:01:59.650 --> 01:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the last round,</v>

1308
01:01:59.831 --> 01:02:01.150
<v Speaker 1>like he thought it was like the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>

1309
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>like he was gone to race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was founded on autopilot.</v>

1310
01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Just your body trying not to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know just get rid of nerves is </v>

1311
01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>just randomly scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blasted.</v>

1312
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I love like striking training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love hitting the pad and hitting the </v>

1313
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>bag and sparring with somebody you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust is fun.</v>

1314
01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>If you can find that guy that knows 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent is 70 percent.</v>

1315
01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>You're 17 months you in the face </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently in your car?</v>

1316
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

1317
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:33.130
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1318
01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you say we're doing literally I go,</v>

1319
01:02:37.181 --> 01:02:39.610
<v Speaker 4>let's go 40 percent because I got too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much</v>

1320
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>and if you got people don't know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do like striking spawn,</v>

1321
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal is that you don't hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other hard.</v>

1322
01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit each other like a little bit but</v>

1323
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't try to knock it out.</v>

1324
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:54.250
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my problem is is I don't get in </v>

1325
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.780
<v Speaker 4>close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I told the guy let's go 40.</v>

1326
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.680
<v Speaker 4>That way if I do get drilled right in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the face,</v>

1327
01:02:57.681 --> 01:03:00.080
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then I throw a kick,</v>

1328
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:05.110
<v Speaker 4>but I'm throwing a kick at 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means any little kid could grab </v>

1329
01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.590
<v Speaker 4>that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going fast,</v>

1330
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.110
<v Speaker 4>so he swoops it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grabs it,</v>

1331
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:14.170
<v Speaker 4>and then blast hunches as as hard as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could after after catches my foot and </v>

1332
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.820
<v Speaker 4>then I'm just laying there and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1333
01:03:16.821 --> 01:03:21.821
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm going to do more jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the worst thing that's going to </v>

1334
01:03:21.821 --> 01:03:22.010
<v Speaker 4>happen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody is going to tap me out.</v>

1335
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean that could be that weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally,</v>

1336
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's more of a not a gentleman's </v>
<v Speaker 4>sport.</v>

1337
01:03:29.061 --> 01:03:34.061
<v Speaker 4>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the worst thing that's happened is </v>

1338
01:03:34.061 --> 01:03:34.640
<v Speaker 4>that I go like that and I'm not going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's not going to pull it back and snap </v>

1344

<v Speaker 1>how does thIs go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even remember your bets.</v>

1388
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to review your recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to shit.</v>

1389
01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Then I took an extended period off and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot to shit and I was like,</v>

1390
01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do something here.</v>

1391
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget a lot of shit.</v>

1392
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I forgot completely forgot how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1393
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this move to break the arm bar.</v>

1394
01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 1>That was called the silverado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite move and I was a purple</v>

1395
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely forgot about it.</v>

1396
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Reviewing it the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1397
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:13.870
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it goes in.</v>

1398
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1399
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how to do it,</v>

1400
01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was like one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>

1401
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

1402
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 1>There's so many moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing about it is</v>

1403
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.950
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's not matched right?</v>

1404
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.320
<v Speaker 2>You think a year from now some guy would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1405
01:06:28.321 --> 01:06:33.321
<v Speaker 2>Something comes off a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are doing offers based on what </v>

1406
01:06:33.481 --> 01:06:38.481
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then no one has ever thought to </v>

1407
01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:38.481
<v Speaker 2>defend this move yet because it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

1408
01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Once it does get invented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to have a counter.</v>

1409
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:44.190
<v Speaker 1>There's this new move they're dudes have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing real recently called the </v>

1410
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:47.131
<v Speaker 1>japanese necktie and it's just come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think it was the first person to </v>

1411
01:06:47.131 --> 01:06:48.750
<v Speaker 1>do it and in the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1412
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it's japanese neck ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sort of like a darce,</v>

1413
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1414
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.270
<v Speaker 1>you grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grab it with a gable grip,</v>

1415
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but he turned the guy's head up towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>his chest and you have your chest pinned</v>

1416
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nasty.</v>

1417
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does no one know this before?</v>

1418
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>We're in this position all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to get the doors,</v>

1419
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>cho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really.</v>

1420
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an even better job.</v>

1421
01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:14.291
<v Speaker 1>This right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you lock up that gable </v>

1422
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 1>grip and you get on top of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tuck it under and you're bending his</v>

1423
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 1>fucking neck towards his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your chest is on top of his head.</v>

1424
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got no air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no blood.</v>

1425
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I do those drills and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>

1426
01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always pretend like we have an odd </v>

1427
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 1>number of people in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1428
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1429
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 1>but you do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to relax.</v>

1430
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Just let him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him yanked your neck around.</v>

1431
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 1>It's such a small difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine and a serious pain.</v>

1432
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get used to that and no </v>

1433
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:41.970
<v Speaker 1>one's going to hurt you doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1434
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

1435
01:07:42.921 --> 01:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>that moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important to learn how,</v>

1436
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it comes on because like the </v>

1437
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>japanese necktie comes on so quick</v>

1438
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:49.920
<v Speaker 2>peruvian guy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1439
01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you're going like this and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just jumping back and hopefully you </v>

1440
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.040
<v Speaker 2>don't go too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a spazzy move.</v>

1441
01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of peruvian necktie and japanese </v>

1442
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 1>necktie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of them are the shit they fucked </v>

1443
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1444
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible position to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the japanese neckties even mom </v>

1445
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>peruvians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty bad ass to the proven you've got </v>

1446
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 1>your weight on top of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always the japanese necktie.</v>

1447
01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:13.980
<v Speaker 1>You kinda like on the side and hooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1448
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't it so good.</v>

1449
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Such a powerful move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I think we're done.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bizarre fucking thing I think I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen on the internet and sheets.</v>

1456

<v Speaker 2>weirdness.</v>

1460
01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:58.460

<v Speaker 2>Do you know if people don't know?</v>

1461
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.890
<v Speaker 2>There's like you can go to vending </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines in Japan.</v>

1462
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 2>You can buy used panties.</v>

1463
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Like that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.660
<v Speaker 2>You go places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell used panties going,</v>

1465
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:13.690

1466
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.250

<v Speaker 2>to do is get a girl.</v>

1468
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Throw in a bag and I think you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough people that you can.</v>

1469
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.740
<v Speaker 2>You'd have different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1470
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.590

1474

<v Speaker 2>thinking about your fashion show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making fanny packs and then used </v>

<v Speaker 2>So instead of expanding packets.</v>

1479

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
