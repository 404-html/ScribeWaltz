00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
Hey
Adam,
how are you buddy?
I'm doing good.

2
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.020
Rally Self.
Good man.
I'm on top of them.
Thank you so much for having me on man.

3
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:13.670
I was a big fan of the show and not just a friend so I love coming on here dude.

4
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:16.920
We've known each other a long time and I was getting weird getting weird and can

5
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.180
wear and we're getting on there and the one that I always brag about like how

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.080
cool was where because you were busy as shit when you did the culture high cause

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.550
everybody always asks being,
you know fans of the show,

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.690
they're like man Romans seems so cool.
I'm like you came to Edmonton to do that.

9
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:31.680
You're doing your shell.

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
It was after your show pack show at the the river Cree and then we started the

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.100
interview at like 11 we didn't get done until one 30 in the morning.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.420
Then you had to fly out in the morning.
Yeah it was what,

13
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:44.320
a couple hours later I will leave.
You know,

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.580
like I just think your fans to know how cool it is that you,

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.310
you do so much to try to help other people.
I'm really appreciate it man.

16
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.390
That took the time and,
and did that when crazy you flew in that day,

17
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.550
did your show,
went for dinner,
came afterwards,

18
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.280
bust out two and a half hours and flew home a couple hours later.

19
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.520
I think that's really cool man.
Oh well thanks man.
This is not that hard.

20
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.870
Just talking.
Yeah,
but you know how to talk.
I can do that.
But the,

21
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.810
the documentary was really good man.
Cultural hose you got,

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.000
I mean I was wondering,
I was like,
man,
where are they going to take it?

23
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.710
Cause you guys covered so much of marijuana prohibition in the Union.

24
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.770
There's two documentaries that I'm was done.
Uh,
the union,

25
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.460
which is all about BC and uh,

26
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.830
what's going on in British Columbia as far as the economy,

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.060
which is just inexorably wrapped up in the cannabis market.

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.870
It's really kind of crazy.
The world of British Columbia,

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
like literally the economy of there would kind of implode if pot went away.

30
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.931
Well that's it.

31
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.450
Like they compare like tourism is number one and then it was like a close second

32
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:45.330
because how do you determine exactly the black market money is,

33
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:50.331
but it was in the estimates were not being questioned at the five to seven to $9

34
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.760
billion range of the black market of the marijuana industry.

35
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.680
We're hate so much weed,
so much being shipped.

36
00:01:55.681 --> 00:02:00.380
And majority of it at that time was going to the United States,
right?
Yeah.

37
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.470
So we looked at that because originally the reason we did the union and looked

38
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.780
focused so much on the BC industries,
I looked at getting into it,

39
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.830
I came back from New York and all the guys that like I went to school with and

40
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.670
stuff,
we're growing and we're doing really well.
They had nice new houses,

41
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.490
new Harley's living on the lake,
and that's what even where the name,

42
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.820
the union came up from when I was like,
dude,
what the fuck is he been doing?

43
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.190
He's doing really well.
And I'm like,
man,
he's in the union.
I'm like,
which one?

44
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.550
I want to sign up.
And they're like,
he grows dope.
And I'm like,
oh,

45
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.110
that's how he's making his money.

46
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.460
So well that that first documentary we was really fascinating and it puts you

47
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:37.080
guys on the map and it took a while before you decided to do another one on pot.

48
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.410
But like I was like,
where are they going to come up with other shit?

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.980
Talk about did you covered everything so thoroughly?
Well thank you.

50
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:47.790
We were the same problem.
Like Brett was really stressed about that.
The director,

51
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.400
like he was just like,
man,
he's like,
I thought I did it all in the union.

52
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.450
Like what?
What?
What?
What can I do?
But the fans really wanted another one.

53
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:57.000
Like when you had me on the last time we were doing the Kickstarter campaign and

54
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.950
we were just receiving thousands of messages and everybody's,
you got a new,

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.220
another

56
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 1>one,
you got to do another one.
So Brett really dove into,</v>

57
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.240
as you saw a human culture and politics,
right.
And then kind of fitting.

58
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.400
We went big into looking at the,

59
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640
how policing has changed in our culture because of the drug war where one of the

60
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:19.981
biggest assets that police had his information to prevent new crimes.

61
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.590
But something that's happened almost strictly because of the drug war,

62
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.870
because of the way that the ratting system goes.
Like,
Hey,

63
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.020
we catch you for minor possession and you've already got parole.

64
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.650
You give us the bigger guys and we'll abolish your thing and you won't go to

65
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.550
jail.
Well people saw their brothers,
cousins,
mothers,

66
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.670
family members getting arrested for simple possession and serving two to three

67
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.880
years that they were like,
well I don't want to talk to the police anymore.

68
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.360
So when a violent crime happens,
rape,
murder or something really heinous,

69
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.340
you don't want to talk to the cops cause you're like,

70
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.670
he might start grinding on me for simple drug possession or something like that.

71
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.330
Right.
And the cops we interviewed said like during their career,

72
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.490
they specifically witnessed the change,

73
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.220
like in the beginning of their career when they're in their 20s they go through

74
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.400
communities and people would come up to them and want to see their badge and

75
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.950
take a picture and see their handcuffs.
And it was like cool.

76
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.920
By the end of their career they would drive down neighborhoods and nobody wanted

77
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.550
to talk to them.
Right.
Because it just felt that they're warring on us.

78
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:16.960
It's US versus them versus being,
you know,
serving and protecting the community.

79
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.060
Wow.
That's fucked.
The,
the,

80
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:24.061
the scene where the guy has his dog shot or the cops break into his house and

81
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.280
there was nothing there.
I mean he had like paraphernalia.

82
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.790
They found a pipe with resin,
shoot his dog,
his little kids.

83
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.960
I mean you and I both have kids.

84
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.080
Like could you imagine people coming in your house like shooting your dog in

85
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.810
front of you and it was a little yappy dog.
Yeah.

86
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.180
It wasn't like some fucking where rottweiler or something like that.
It was just,

87
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.960
it's so sick because they do it to intimidate the people and to let the people

88
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.600
know they mean business and because they can,
you know.

89
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.480
You know that story about the mayor who lives outside of DC,

90
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.340
they accidentally did this to him.
Yes,
I heard about that.
Yeah,

91
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.390
those have been a good store.

92
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.760
I was wondering if you were going to cover it in the documentary.

93
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.420
It's a crazy story for folks who don't know about it.
This guy,

94
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.140
apparently the postman was having pot shipped to this house because he knew that

95
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.180
this was on his route,

96
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.450
so he would just intercept it and so like he knew that the package was from his

97
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:16.690
friend,
so he would,

98
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.680
he would look at all the packages that came to this guy's house and because it

99
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:24.550
was in a nice area,
a lot of people wouldn't question it.
Well,
somehow or another,

100
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:25.990
the DEA got wind of this.

101
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.340
They realized that a package was coming to this guy's house and so they just

102
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.680
decided to ray the dude's house.
They kick in the door,

103
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.810
waving the full for all you heard was,
papa don't hit me.
No think they should.

104
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.920
They shoot the guy's dog.
And then they ran out.
They had labs,
you know,

105
00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:41.830
like would you like the friendliest dog ever?
Ever.

106
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.210
The dog ran out into the yard to hide and they went and found him and shot him.

107
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.810
You know,
I mean,
they allow the two shot,

108
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.710
two dogs and then they zip tied the family.
Um,

109
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.950
and this guy was a fucking my hair,
you know,
and he's like,
oh,
you can't,

110
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.950
I can't believe,
but it's kind of good for it.
Not for the dogs,

111
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:01.790
obviously to get shot.

112
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.480
But for a guy like that to see like this is what happens when you're a regular

113
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.580
person.
If they don't know you,
you know,

114
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.730
they don't know about your relationship with city hall or any of that nonsense.

115
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.670
They just,
this is how they treat you.
If they can.
Well,

116
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:17.060
and then you can imagine if you're from a lower economic situation right now,

117
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.380
you're stuck in the legal system.
Good luck.
Right?

118
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.530
And trying to get out of that and fight your way out.

119
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.540
You are looked at as a criminal from day one,

120
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.080
even if you're innocent and we go deep into the asset forfeiture laws in the

121
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:27.801
film too,
right,

122
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.090
where they take everything in certain states and then you have to prove that

123
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.680
they didn't have the right to take in the first place,

124
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:37.340
that that wasn't proceeds of crime.
Right.
Go in and take.

125
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.990
It's funny cause that opening scene like people are shocked by it,
but I've read,

126
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.920
received a lot of people that were really like huge as they are so mad,

127
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:50.090
they're like,
that was not needed in the film.
It's ridiculous.
I stopped watching.

128
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.250
As soon as you put it there and oh,
they're babies.

129
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.820
They need to realize this is what's going on and you're doing a documentary on

130
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:56.571
disturbing things.

131
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.930
You want to leave out the disturbing things from the documentary and disturbing

132
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:03.020
things.
Exactly like in the theater when you watch it with a crowd,

133
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.780
which is always my favorite part is a filmmaker.

134
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.620
When you can really see it having an impact.

135
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.770
And you see the audience right there that wakes everybody up,

136
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.860
the credits come in and it's like boom,
that happens.
And everybody's like,

137
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.330
Oh shit.
Okay we're going on a ride here.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,

138
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:20.540
well it's awful rod.
You know that that really hurts my feelings.

139
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.490
I want and that's a,
that's hard to deal with.

140
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.070
That asset forfeiture laws really fucked too.

141
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:27.990
There's a guy who was a store owner and a,

142
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.010
he had made apparently made too many deposits that were less than a $10,000 in

143
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:37.150
cash and they accused him of,
you know,
I guess they have some,

144
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.960
some thing called structuring or something like that.
And the idea of being like,

145
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.590
oh I'll pull this uh,
image or the uh,
the story rather.
Cause it was a,

146
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.400
it's kind of a fucked up story man.
Cause this guy was just a store owner.

147
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:54.230
I mean he,
there's no evidence whatsoever that this guy has done anything wrong.

148
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.780
I mean he's doing all these interviews in his store.

149
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:59.270
He would take some of the money from his store.
You know,

150
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.950
I don't know if you put it in a safe or whatever and he would get up to you
know,

151
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.080
eight thousand nine thousand bucks and just go deposit it in the bank.

152
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.370
Thought there was no big deal.

153
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.510
The Dea came in and just stole all of his fucking money,

154
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.780
like literally stole all of his fucking money and now this guy is stuck and now

155
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.020
you have to go spend all the money to try to argue no more than they stole.

156
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.560
I'm sure you know it's crazy.
Well that's the part,
you know,

157
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:28.820
through both films that was so I think shocking for us is when you sit down with

158
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.990
all these ex law enforcement,
because in the culture I,

159
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:32.300
we sat down with Sean done again.

160
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:36.050
He was a former DEA analyst and you sit down with,
yeah,
you got it Jeremy.

161
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:39.530
That's it.
I just pulled it off of,
here's this gentleman seven.

162
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.310
He's a convenience store on us structuring policy.
So what does that,

163
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:47.480
if they see too many deposits just conveniently under $10,000 and they consider

164
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:52.040
it.
Yeah,
I mean,
but this guy,
he just owns a convenience store.

165
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:56.370
He gets cash.
I mean it's all right there.
It's all super obvious

166
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 2>and the guy's gone public with it all.</v>

167
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.390
So it's a massive embarrassment for the IRS.
They're just,
it's just evil.

168
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.300
It's just the fact that they think that they can do this,
you know,

169
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.300
like there's no evidence whatsoever.

170
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.870
Suspicion of structuring is what they call.
And by the way,

171
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:17.040
that violates their own requirements.
It's not like they have,

172
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.070
they have like requirements that you have to meet in order for them to take the

173
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.630
money if they accuse you of structuring.

174
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.130
There has to be some evidence whatsoever,

175
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.040
but there's nothing and there's continuing to pursue.

176
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.450
It was the DEA is me getting hit hard lately cause you've seen Michelle

177
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.140
Lionheart step down,
right?
She's a fucking dummy.

178
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.730
Oh my God,
that lady so dumb.
Well that clip is so good.
I mean it's been all over,

179
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:43.440
but we use it in the culture high too,
right?

180
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:44.820
Where that guy just grills are right.

181
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.270
It's like all of his math bars for you to have marijuana.

182
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.200
All drugs are bad.
Again.
Again,

183
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.640
all drugs are bad.
That part he's so dumb.

184
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.850
It's amazing that that lady figured out a way to get that Gig.

185
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
She is so poorly equipped to discuss the nature of addiction and drugs in front

186
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.540
of the whole world.
Like that.
You could see her deer in the headlights look like,

187
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.970
did you fuck him prepare for this at all lady?

188
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.480
Well that's I think Jank in the film.
He does a great part where he explains,

189
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.490
he's like,
you know,
Obama could have picked anyone.
He's like,

190
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.130
why did he pick the most right wing or Republican?
He's like,

191
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.550
cause then that way he'll see more moderate and it might help them to get votes

192
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:26.280
in the future.
And that's exactly what it is.

193
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:30.480
It's just he's really good at playing that stupid fucking politician.
Oh,

194
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:32.730
it's that line that Janky is in the film that I love and he's like,

195
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.830
and that's what people does.
Nobody gets about Obama.

196
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.040
He's a politician just like the rest of them.
Right.
Don't be mistaken.

197
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.790
There's no other way to get to that position where you're going to actually get

198
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.280
in the White House.
You're one of those two guys.
You know,

199
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:48.360
the commission for presidential debates is a privately owned institution.

200
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.340
People don't,
a lot of people don't know it.

201
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:52.840
Can you see those guys that are being,
uh,

202
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.320
there debating each other on television?
You figure like,
well,
those guys are the,

203
00:10:57.321 --> 00:11:01.480
the most popular candidates.
This is not exactly,
you know,

204
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.580
the ones marketed correctly and have the money behind them.
Yeah.
You have to,

205
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.080
just in order to get into the commission for presidential debates to get into

206
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:14.220
the,
uh,
the debate,
you have to have 15%,
uh,

207
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.030
polling in five poles and they can choose those poles.

208
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.730
They can just go and rent,
decide this uses,

209
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.730
who chooses the people that run the commission for presidential debates,

210
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:28.650
which is owned by like some multinational corporations and does a bunch of bunch

211
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:33.010
of fuckery involved.
Well,
they let Ron Paul in,
or excuse me,
um,

212
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.200
the fuck's his name,
the old dude.
But Ross Perot,
Ross Perot,

213
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.350
Ross Perot fucked everything up for everybody.
And Ross Perot.

214
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.360
People don't remember.
Ross Perot,
who was this crazy Texas billionaire who,

215
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.130
um,
you know,
accused

216
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.560
essentially the IRS and the Federal Bank of,

217
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:54.070
of running this crazy pyramid scheme.
And you know,

218
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.060
<v 1>I mean,
he was,
uh,</v>

219
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.500
talking about the federal bank and the Federal Reserve long before anybody ever

220
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:03.100
understood that the Federal Reserve had nothing to do with federal,
I mean,

221
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:05.800
they call it the Federal Reserve.
It's like,
it's a privately owned company.

222
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.180
It's kind of hilarious that all of our money goes through that.
I mean,
the,

223
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:13.000
the hustle runs so deep and has been going on for so long,

224
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.980
but Ross Perot was this billionaire dot dude who this is pre internet.

225
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.470
And he bought out time on,

226
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:25.180
on television and put his own television show on and had like fucking charts and

227
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:28.810
graphs and showed where the money was going.
And everybody's like,
Whoa,
whoa.
What?

228
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.850
Like he was the big,

229
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.340
he was like the first blip of this information,
uh,

230
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:39.370
that getting it out there to the public that is now like all over the Internet,

231
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:40.390
all over the Internet.
You know,

232
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.450
like people have this day and age like you taught you,

233
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:47.020
you could talk to the average 20 year old kid today and ask her like how the

234
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.480
Federal Reserve Works and I bet there's a lot of them that will go,

235
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.450
I'll tell you exactly how it works.
If you're dealt holy shit,

236
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.680
if you don't know exactly,

237
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:58.390
they're at least hip to it that it's a private corporation and there definitely

238
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:00.700
that access.
You guys talked about a lot here on the podcast,

239
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:04.510
but that access to information is change the game.
There's no more of those.

240
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.960
I used to call him toppers in high school that like whatever story you had,

241
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:09.790
like you had a cool story and they'd be like,
yeah,

242
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.480
well this one time I like whoa.
Like now you can be like,
okay,

243
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:16.480
so when were you there and you said you met such and such celebrity.

244
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.280
Well he wasn't there on those dates,
right?

245
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:22.210
He was touring like now you can call out that bullshit.
Yeah,
you could Snopes it.

246
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.100
Or like the urban legend that was,

247
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.500
you know when I was in high school was like that guy did so much acid.

248
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.410
He thought he was an orange or a banana and now he just just scared,

249
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:32.650
don't peel me,
don't peel me and now you Snopes and everybody's like,
no.

250
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:35.890
That's a common misconception of a guy that I'm sure maybe somewhere down the

251
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:37.780
road there was someone that thought something similar,

252
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.260
but that was like the scare story.
Urban legend that you'd heard what?

253
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:43.120
I was going to high school?
Yeah.
I didn't even find it.

254
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:47.470
I found out about Snopes through the rocket one where the guy like Patada rocket

255
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:51.490
to his car,
the truck and flew into a mountain and died.

256
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.470
I remember hearing about that and I was like,
what?

257
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:58.150
It was like one of those Darwin awards one,
but then it a Snopes was like,
Eh,

258
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.060
I don't think so.
It wasn't true when it might've been.

259
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.980
The thing about that is like,

260
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.010
you know for sure if someone has a rocket and someone has a car,

261
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.570
there's someone dumb enough to try a strap.

262
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.040
Those two things together and see what's up.

263
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.280
Like it's not outside the realm of possibility.
Absolutely not.

264
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.400
It's not saying like a guy went to the moon and you know,
found a Hubcap,
uh,

265
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.050
after hurting a nightclub for several years when I was younger.

266
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.780
I've seen tremendous amounts of stupid things happen,

267
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:24.700
especially when they're under the influence of alcohol.

268
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:27.610
You can't put it past what people will do every time you think you've seen it,

269
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:31.510
all a new one comes by and you're like,
uh,
okay,
now I've seen it all.
Well,

270
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:36.160
that's how the whole political system is capable of working in the first place

271
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:38.440
is because like,
people really are dumb.
They really,

272
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:41.830
you really can trick a good giant chunk of the people.

273
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.670
And we were talking about before,
but the commission for presidential debates,
um,

274
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.730
now it's because Ross Perot came in and fucked up everything and he's the reason

275
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:52.220
why Clinton

276
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.910
<v 2>got elected in the first place over Herbert Walker Bush,
the old man Bush.</v>

277
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.240
But now because of that,
it's like virtually impossible.

278
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.860
The jacked it up from 5% to 15%.
And you would have to spend,

279
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.040
they think that a conservative estimate is $250 million just in order to reach

280
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.830
15% in popular polls and like any popular polls and so to get five and r and

281
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.000
also they would have to pick those five like they could pick a few that you were

282
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:23.310
in in,
you know,
or that you didn't pull well in the go.
Oh No.
You know,

283
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.510
it's not like states that you definitely don't match with the,

284
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:30.560
the overall consensus.
Yeah.
It's just,

285
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.000
it's so,

286
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.920
it's just really weird that it's been so long and this hustle has been going on

287
00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:41.921
for so long and no one like no one in the political system,

288
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.520
no one in like the Supreme Court or in Congress.
No one is stepping up to say,

289
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.540
hey,
why exactly do these guys get all this money?

290
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.470
But there's some weird people on the Supreme Court that are on deck for sure.

291
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.300
<v 0>I actually started looking at it up from guests you've had on here that talked</v>

292
00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:00.310
about that and I started looking up some of those people.
I'm like,

293
00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:02.560
are you kidding me that this guy's in a position of it

294
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.200
<v 2>power?
Like that's fucking scary.
Oh,
Clarence Thomas,</v>

295
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:09.170
you remember all that shit with him.
And then Anita Hill and the,

296
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.410
he was at the pubic hair and are coca cola and he was like a sexual harasser.

297
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.050
But that could have been bullshit too.
You know?

298
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:20.580
That's a good way to defuse somebody.
You know what I'm saying?

299
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.600
He's talking shit about,
you know,
sex in the office.

300
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:28.340
And I just think that we've reached this weird point where the age of

301
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:32.360
information and the old guard,
the way politics is always been done,

302
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:35.130
which is through deception and cronyism and Horse Shit.

303
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.990
It's like they're not compatible with each other because the age of information

304
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:42.830
is going to slowly but surely expose all these things and certain things.
Like,

305
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.391
I mean,

306
00:16:43.391 --> 00:16:48.391
I firmly believe that the Internet is the primary reason why marijuana is legal

307
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:51.830
in Colorado.
Marijuana is legal in Washington DC.

308
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.870
Marijuana is legal and which is really kind of crazy when you think about it.

309
00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:55.210
Yeah.

310
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.040
<v 0>When it's changing all over the world like that.
Right.
And I would totally agree.</v>

311
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:00.770
We put that in the culture high,
right?
Yeah.
That's the cause.

312
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:03.530
Now you know when politicians like w in the union,

313
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:05.870
we have that clip of Ronald Reagan and he's in that,

314
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.240
I don't know what press comment,
but he's like,
you know,

315
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.380
there's this new information and these sign on,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

316
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.570
surprise to the media hasn't made more available,
but they,
then they have,

317
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:17.570
but they believe marijuana can be the most dangerous drug that is in use in our

318
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.940
society today.
Remember,
it's that clip we have in our trailer.

319
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.020
Well nowadays you can literally be like,
okay,
I'm on Web MD.

320
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:25.340
Like what study you're referring to?

321
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:27.980
I'll look it up right now and you come to my own conformed conclusion.

322
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.860
But when he was doing those press conferences,
you're like,
hey,

323
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.530
this is a man of stature and power.
He's got information.

324
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:37.880
We're not privy to like Matt,
it is bad.
He's got scientists that know shit.

325
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:38.810
I don't.
Yup.

326
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.340
So now that's just pulled out of the woodwork like you see it in with Mitt

327
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.341
Romney,

328
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:46.100
we have some good clips of him where they kind of challenge him on things.
Right.

329
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:49.320
And like the old Barbara Bush of like just say no to drugs.
Like you know,

330
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:53.160
we show that scene with jade and David write 500 seizures a day and then he's

331
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.150
taking the non psychoactive CBD and now he's having one to two seizures a month,

332
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.080
which by the way is my friend's child as well.
Different a different kid.

333
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.140
But my friend's child did the exact same situation and it's working great for

334
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.410
him.
Fantastic.
His kid was having massive seizures all the time.

335
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.540
He moved up to Seattle so that he could get him on a CBD oil and now they're

336
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:15.810
gone.
Like the kid is much more engaging.
He talks,

337
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:18.170
he's like pretty severe autistic.
Yeah.

338
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.220
And that's something that with Jason,
he,

339
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.740
he's not sure how much was from the condition or how much was from the

340
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.280
medication that jade and took for,
you know,
the first seven years of his life,

341
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:33.150
he had over 25,000 pills.
Right.
A lot of them psychoactive pills.

342
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.840
And it's sad that your friend has to move to another state in order to get

343
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.070
something that is working.

344
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.540
We had a local girl in Colona to Kyla Williams that we did that we,

345
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.710
we did a screening there and we raised a whole bunch of money for and presented

346
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:49.230
a check for three grand and they came to the screening and the same thing,

347
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:52.860
they're fighting on the front line saying that because Canada has this real

348
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:57.030
hokey thing with it,
like it's federally approved due to a court case,
right,

349
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:00.300
where they said it's unconstitutional to deny people that are getting relief

350
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:03.750
from something.
Right.
So the Canadian feds have,

351
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.260
they dance around saying,
well we don't approve of it,

352
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:10.410
but if people are seeing benefits,
we can't prohibit them from getting it.

353
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:14.340
So you can get like a license in Canada that will make it anywhere across the

354
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:18.870
country that allows you to use it,
but they don't allow concentrates.

355
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.290
I'm like oils or edibles or anything like that.

356
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.830
So for Kyla who was only two or three at the time,

357
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.320
essentially they're saying she has to smoke it and her parents were like,

358
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:29.071
that's ridiculous.

359
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:33.450
Like we should be able to get the oil because that's considered a concentrate.

360
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:35.420
Right?
So they're like,
well no,
we're going to end.

361
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:39.030
Her grandfather was actually ex law enforcement and he said,

362
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.530
I'm going to break the law.

363
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:43.860
I used to think like everybody else cause I used to arrest when people would

364
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:47.220
bring up the marijuana medicinal argument as a law enforcement officer.
I'm like,

365
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:50.340
that's a bunch of hippy bullshit until it happened to my granddaughter.

366
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.740
Now I see what everybody was arguing about,
right?

367
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:56.520
And I'm going to fight just as hard so that my daughter can get access to safe

368
00:19:56.521 --> 00:20:01.020
medical marijuana that works for her.
And she's responding tremendously.

369
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:04.430
Like she's got her life back.
She's focusing now.
Seizures are a big thing.

370
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.610
She's been seizure free.
That's great to hear,
man.
It's great to hear.
But it's,

371
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:11.670
it's sad to hear that it's so difficult to get,
it's sad to hear that it's,

372
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.290
it's such a complex issue,
but it's so simple.
I mean there's a plant,

373
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.760
it grows naturally and it's really good for you.
It's that simple at the end,

374
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:24.000
right?
And it has benefits and if you regulate it and control it,

375
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:28.080
like other products and studies have shown this is one of the most dangerous

376
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:32.670
plants ever observes as well.
I love all the dangers and strict nine.
Well,

377
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:34.140
they always bring in the the,
well,

378
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:36.690
that's where everyone laughs in the theater when you bring up the popcorn

379
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.370
analogy,
they're putting,
they're like,
they're like,
yeah,
they're like,
you know,
uh,

380
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.300
if you need a pound of salt,
you'll fucking die.
Right?
He's like,

381
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.150
but if you put a little bit of Po salt on popcorn,
it's actually quite good.

382
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:48.130
It tastes good,
right?
Like you can't,
like,
yes,
people can abuse

383
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.190
<v 2>just about anything.
Yeah.
A pound of salt will fucking kill you.</v>

384
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:54.490
You could go buy a pound of salt right now.
I mean,
any liquor store you go to,

385
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:56.380
you could drink yourself to death quite easily.

386
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.590
But we just go and just pick up a couple bottles of Jack Daniels and you're off

387
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.960
to the races.
It's over.
Former nightclub owner.
I've seen.

388
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:04.750
There's nothing more destructive than that stuff.
Nothing.
It's horrible.

389
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.940
It's horrible that that's our sanction drug.

390
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:10.360
Like we would have a totally different culture and the evidence is coming out of

391
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:14.140
Denver.
You look,
Denver has the lowest Dui rates they've ever recorded.

392
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.520
They have lower rates of assault and murder than they've ever recorded.

393
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:18.990
They have.

394
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:23.140
There's all these crazy numbers that are coming in and then the tax revenue is

395
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:25.270
off the charts.
They're making so much fucking money.

396
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:29.170
They have to give it back to the people and sadly that's the only thing that's

397
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:32.350
probably going to push.
A lot of other states are sad.
Sad though.
It's good.
No,

398
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:34.300
it's good.
It's good that it's happened.
It's sad that it's,

399
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.590
I always get scared when it's the wrong moral reason of why they're doing it.

400
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:42.490
Right.
That's the only reason.
And a politician he'll sell you on like,
well,

401
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:46.210
we want to help the people,
but it's really to make their pockets bigger.
Yeah.

402
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.850
I mean it is sad,
but that's the nature of the beast.

403
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.040
That's like getting angry at a whore that she sucked your Dick.

404
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:55.120
Now she wants money.
Thought it was good.
You were really moaning.

405
00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:59.920
You probably enjoyed it.
Come on.
Good point.
We're not friends.
They're whores.

406
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.500
They're all politicians are horrors,
man.
I mean that's really what they do.

407
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.400
That's their,
their,

408
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.360
their job is to be fake and to get really good at being fake and figure out

409
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:08.280
where the tide is turning,

410
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.290
lick their finger and put it up and find out what that meant exactly.

411
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.340
We have you doing in the culture.
I right.
We're to,

412
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.730
we're going to go where the wind blows,
right?
We're going to go,

413
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.660
it's from my hunting experience actually with you.
Yeah.

414
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.910
You put powder in the air with when you hunt,

415
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.320
shoot to powder up in the air and it takes you where the wind,
we see the wing.

416
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.270
Yeah,
like baby shower.
It's like these little things.

417
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:30.430
You puff them in the air and it tells you which way the wind's blowing.

418
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.540
But I think that what's what's happening now with,

419
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:38.541
with information is because the fact that all the studies are out and all these

420
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:44.080
people that are involved in law enforcement have the opportunity to know someone

421
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.230
who is benefiting from it cancer or whether it's a people that have a severe

422
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:51.790
epilepsy,
whether it's autism,

423
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.720
there's so many different possible medical uses that could touch these people.

424
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.900
And so they become very skeptical.
Like one of my good friends,

425
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.130
he's a hardcore Republican,
he's really silly.
Like he's one of those dudes,

426
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:05.400
like he told me,
he's trying to tell me Obama was a Muslim guy.

427
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.100
We were at a party,
were to fucking laugh at that stuff from Canada.

428
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:12.220
I think that's really hilarious.
Obama is the biggest Muslim in the CALC I dude.

429
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.110
Right.
But this guy is,

430
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:19.111
his mom got sick and a stage four cancer and tr the CBD oils helped her

431
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.020
tremendously and now he's become this evangelist for it.

432
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.040
I mean he's still not engaging in an himself,
but he,
you know,

433
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.450
you could benefit from it.

434
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:32.320
It's like all the things that people don't want out a pot or one of the things

435
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:33.430
that pea potter good for.

436
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.850
Like this thing about like who don't want to lose control.

437
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.550
Like do you really do want to lose control?
You just don't know.

438
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.170
Like your ego has this fucking terrible grip on you and it's putting you in this

439
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:47.420
very confined way of looking at the world.

440
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:52.160
You have a very confined narrow gap that you're looking at the world through and

441
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.210
things like marijuana will open that gap up and allow you to,

442
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.690
to consider or reconsider your positions on all these things.

443
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.050
And that's one of the most terrifying aspects of it.

444
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:07.970
The politicians as well as to law enforcement because the idea that they'd been

445
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:12.971
wrong this whole time and they're going to somehow or another half to justify

446
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:14.930
all the different shit that they've done.

447
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.160
It's like once the cat's out of the bag like it is in Denver,

448
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.990
like it isn't Washington state,

449
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.600
that cat is going to get out of the bag everywhere.

450
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.991
<v 0>Well,
and like you said,</v>

451
00:24:24.991 --> 00:24:28.890
the Internet is allowed where all those individual personal stories all over the

452
00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:32.640
world can be shared in real time.
But you have HD on your phone,
right?

453
00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:36.390
So you can film like Jayden or Jason did that with his son Jayden,

454
00:24:36.391 --> 00:24:39.270
where he recorded like how the medication was working,

455
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:42.450
the pharmaceutical and like in real time like here's what it's doing.

456
00:24:42.451 --> 00:24:45.270
He's now having tremors.
He's now having this from,
you know,

457
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.870
so and then you can put it on the Internet where other people can get informed

458
00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:50.610
that you couldn't do that years ago.
Right.

459
00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:54.100
It was like an urban myth way down the,
I heard it might work.
Right,
right.

460
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.330
Even we have a,
we have a,
a personal clip that's in the DVD,

461
00:24:57.331 --> 00:24:59.250
extras of the culture that didn't make it in the film,

462
00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:00.900
but it's about Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
right.

463
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.040
The First Ivy League doctor to start coming out with the real scientific

464
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:08.370
evidence to cannabis.
And he all did it on a bet to Carl Sagan.

465
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.210
They were best friends and Carl Sagan used to smoke three to four joints every

466
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:16.050
day and go work at NASA.
All law and discover,
hey,

467
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.640
some of the greatest theories to this day,
you've,
you've interviewed Neil,

468
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.400
the grass stayed like Carl Sagan is who everybody aspires to.
And Lester,

469
00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:24.970
this is what's kind of funny about the stories.

470
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.380
He went to prove Carl Sagan wrong.
He said,
he's like,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

471
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:31.470
I'm a physician.
I am.
I'm from heart.
Like Carl,
that's just going to kill you.

472
00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:34.350
And Carl Biko relax.
Lester have a puff flag.
It's not a big deal.

473
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.620
So Lester started looking into literature and started pulling it from all the

474
00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:40.860
different universities and then realize that he'd been do,
he's like,

475
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.970
he be fucking kidding me.

476
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.780
I'm a Harvard professor and I was telling all these people and I was completely

477
00:25:45.781 --> 00:25:47.790
wrong.
So then he wrote his first paper,

478
00:25:47.791 --> 00:25:50.550
which Harvard totally tried to back out of and they didn't want to give him his

479
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:54.060
professorship of marijuana reconsidered.
And then he wrote marijuana,

480
00:25:54.061 --> 00:25:57.840
the forbidden medicine.
And then just as fate would have it,
his son,

481
00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:03.030
Danny gets diagnosed with leukemia at 11 years old and he's ashamed of himself

482
00:26:03.031 --> 00:26:04.110
at the time that he didn't.

483
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.140
He's going through the regular treatments or the oncologist going through the

484
00:26:07.141 --> 00:26:10.470
Chemo and everything and his daddy was getting really sick and the nausea

485
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.690
affected his son more than anything,
right.

486
00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:16.680
His kid would be terrified for a week in advance of how sick he was going to
get.

487
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.580
And finally another physician was like,
well Lester,
I read your stuff.

488
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.200
Have you tried cannabis?

489
00:26:22.201 --> 00:26:25.950
Like the stuff for anti nausea seems to be amazing and the science is there.

490
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.120
And he was like,
well I don't want to upset Harvard.
And Danny's like too young.

491
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.340
And then here's the kind of,

492
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:36.360
the kicker of the story that's so funny is that they go to the very place that

493
00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:40.050
prohibition supposed to keep it out of his mom and daddy just go themselves

494
00:26:40.051 --> 00:26:42.810
cause they're willing to try it.
They've read his paper at the manuscript,

495
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.480
they go to the local high school,
right.

496
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.830
And Mrs Grinspoon and Danny asked their friends within 10 minutes they got the

497
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:54.630
weed,
smoked it,
and his,
his oncologist said like radar thing.
He's like,

498
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.360
what did you guys do differently with Danny?
He came in,

499
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.770
took his therapy left and actually ate a full six inch sandwich one.

500
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.590
Whereas usually he was puking for three or four days,
right?

501
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:08.820
He was actually able and Lester's like it gave my son an extra two years of life

502
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:12.450
cause he could battle the nausea and keeps them nutrition down.

503
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.440
It's those little wins with health that goes such a long way when you're in the

504
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:17.370
cancer thing,
right?

505
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:20.310
Like if you're able to eat a little bit of food and get a little bit of

506
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:23.520
nutrition and that little bit of nutrition helps your body to fight back on its

507
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:25.230
own,
on top of the medication.

508
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.470
And that's where people can get caught up on the other side where like it's the

509
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:32.940
cure,
it's the cure,
not the cure.
Right.
As we interviewed oncologists,

510
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.590
cancer is individual specific DNA specific,
gender specific.

511
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:40.410
So what might work for you might not work for somebody else,

512
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.350
but that doesn't mean that if it does work for someone,

513
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:47.670
that shouldn't be a viable option for them to use that it's unquestionably a

514
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:49.530
very effective treatment.
There's been many,

515
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:53.430
many peer reviewed studies that show that without a doubt,

516
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.070
cannabis has a positive effect on people with cancer,

517
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.820
whether it's helping them sleep.
That's another big one that gives people sleep,

518
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:03.000
which helps your immune system,
which helps your immune system fight off cancer.

519
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.310
There's,
and it helps inflammation,

520
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:07.970
which also helps your body fight a lot of stuff and inflammation.

521
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.700
There's just so many,
so many factors that it's just,
it's gross,
man.

522
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.291
It's gross.

523
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:16.620
It's gross that we're in this position where we actually have to debate this.

524
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.470
This is like you and me sitting down talking about the benefits of drinking

525
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:19.800
water,

526
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.960
<v 2>water release,
but if you drink too much mineral water,</v>

527
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.770
that water,
that water is what they should be.
Kids are on their fucking,

528
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.970
I just think it's,

529
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.150
it's a matter of time and hopefully we'll see it in our lifetime.

530
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.000
I'm still amazed that it's still illegal.
I mean,

531
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:37.710
I remember when I was a kid in high school,

532
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.840
I just think it was the dumbest fucking thing ever.

533
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.100
I couldn't imagine that it had some and I didn't even know the facts of it.

534
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.761
I mean,

535
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.390
all I knew was that like there was drugs and there was pot and pot just kind of

536
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:52.290
made you dopey.
But alcohol was legal.
And I remember like,

537
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:55.430
I remember the first time I ever got drunk,
I was at my friend's house and uh,

538
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.420
we were listening to like fucking the doors and led Zepplin Shit Drinking Jack

539
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.280
Daniels and I was like 14 I just never should have.

540
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.380
I've threw up in a cow is disgusting.

541
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.490
Every everything about it was completely disgusting.
But um,

542
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.750
I remember like the next day,
like there's horrible hangover.

543
00:29:11.751 --> 00:29:15.300
It's pounding headache and thinking,
how the fuck is that legal?

544
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.580
Like you could just drink whatever you want.

545
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.250
It's not even like they distributed to you.
Like,
you know,

546
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:25.251
like if you go and you say you get a Adderall or oxycontin or some sort of

547
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.240
strong prescription drug there it comes in pill form.

548
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.650
It says take two pills,
they give you a bottle of Jack and they're like,

549
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:37.090
good luck.
Fuck.
Then.

550
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.160
Then they advertise it like it's the sexiest thing ever,
right?

551
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.040
Like it's beautiful

552
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.790
<v 0>guys that are clean cut and girls that are smoking hot and you're having a drink</v>

553
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:46.750
and everything's perfect.

554
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.310
As a former nightclub owner I can say it hardly ever looks like that.
It's messy,

555
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:55.060
sweaty like it's not.
When I see those commercial I'm like that's very funny.

556
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:56.650
I was like,
you should film in my bar a little bit.

557
00:29:56.651 --> 00:30:01.040
It doesn't look like it at all.
I mean and I'm not anti alcohol.
It just,

558
00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:04.780
it just staggers the imagination.
It really their will.

559
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:07.690
And here's the point I thought about when we were doing the union like as a

560
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:11.920
nightclub owner and it was a interesting self reflection that came through cause

561
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:13.030
I was on the other side of weed.

562
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:17.230
I was very anti when I was younger because I bought into all the bullshit and

563
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.510
when I owned a nightclub,
when I,
we started doing the union,

564
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:22.420
he started learning so much.
I remember like after interviewing norm stamper,

565
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:25.390
the former police chief of Seattle or Dr,
lesser like my mind,

566
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:28.180
it'd be spinning for two weeks.
I'm just like,
I can't believe this.

567
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:29.770
Like I started looking at everything different.

568
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:34.180
And then here I was a nightclub owner serving people booze that they want and

569
00:30:34.181 --> 00:30:37.360
we're supposed to not overserve but if you find me a bar,

570
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.880
I will find you a time when they overserve.
Right.

571
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:42.670
Like people come up that I go on six shots.
You're like,
well no,

572
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:45.490
actually you're only supposed to order one per person so it can get all six

573
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:47.050
people to come to the table.
Please.

574
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.830
The only bar where they don't overserve Disneyland.
If a problem,

575
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.460
if you go to the Disneyland Hotel,
the strict as fuck.

576
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.340
Like I tried to order four drinks,
they wouldn't even give it to me.

577
00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.360
I'll give you two drinks at a time.
You're like,
what?
Like a shot and a beer.

578
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.850
That's it.
You know,
I don't even know if they have shots.

579
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:07.000
I think they were like mixed drinks.
That makes sense.
But that's Disneyland.

580
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.360
But I'm not surprised.
But when at the bar when we had it,

581
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:12.610
like I thought about like,
you know,
and you've seen it too.

582
00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:15.330
I've ever talk about like,
you know,
seeing the odd bar fight and stuff.

583
00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.990
And then when something like that happen,

584
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.960
I put it back to if it was in prohibition days.
Right.
Like a fight happens,

585
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.060
the guy gets knocked out really bad.
Well,

586
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:24.940
if it was during the days when you weren't supposed to be serving alcohol,

587
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.700
I can just imagine what they did with the severely injured guy.

588
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:29.950
They probably just threw him up the street and said like,

589
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.190
call an ambulance so it's not anywhere near us.
Otherwise we go down,

590
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.190
where's it at least now,
like you know,
yes,

591
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.820
there's problems associated with alcohol.

592
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.690
There's almost nothing we're going to do in society that's not going to have

593
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.260
some kind of problem or social aspect where we're going to have to adapt and

594
00:31:44.261 --> 00:31:48.090
make sure it works perfectly.
Right.
Particularly alcohol particularly.
Yeah,

595
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.070
like I'm not anti alcohol.
Neither am I at,
I used to serve it.

596
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:53.140
How can I sell it and make a profit,

597
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:57.670
but it is the number one drug when it comes to like social problems,

598
00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:58.740
domestic violence.

599
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.220
There's so many different things go wrong when people drink and it's everywhere.

600
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.970
And the idea that somehow know that they've been able to demonize marijuana,

601
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.240
which has the complete opposite effect.

602
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.440
Show me a group of potheads that are in getting engaged in gang violence,

603
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.310
beating each other up.
They're meeting in the fucking park and duking it out.

604
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.680
Good.
You're not going to,
I mean,

605
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:23.560
show me a bunch of people that are smoking pot that are,
you know,

606
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:28.150
running around getting him Barb,
you know,
pot bar fights.
It doesn't,

607
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.310
isn't it?
It's the opposite is the end.
It was something that I,

608
00:32:31.311 --> 00:32:34.750
I witnessed organically when I was going through the discovery with the union

609
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:37.180
like that.
Cause at that time I owned the Bar,
right?

610
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:40.100
So I'd see every weekend it was like fight someone dry and it was crazy

611
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.791
<v 1>about booze.</v>

612
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:44.480
The effect it has on people sometimes like people will fight their friends,

613
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.280
they'll get drunk and like all of a sudden I'm like,
dude,

614
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:50.390
you guys are best friends and now you're willing to strike him in the face just

615
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:52.670
because you're a little drunk.
Like that's crazy.

616
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.660
But then we went to hemp fest where there's like 50,000 people smoking weed,

617
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.420
no fights.
It was like nothing.
Everybody's like,
you bump into some of the right,

618
00:32:59.421 --> 00:33:03.110
terribly sorry man.
I'm like,
wow.

619
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:06.080
I remember pointing that out being like I can't believe there isn't lake.

620
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.880
Cause we had a room full of 200 art capacity was only 235 and I mean there's

621
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:13.910
fights all the time.
Well imagine if you had like 50,000 people.

622
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:15.080
That Tequila fest,

623
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.200
that's the start of the Zombie apocalypse right there.
Yeah.

624
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.800
You'd be like of just a patch of people eating a joke.

625
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.950
It's a fucking horrible drug.
But again,
I support it.
It's just,

626
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:32.330
I just keep thinking that we're in the transitionary age,

627
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.340
we're in the age where people are finally getting it.

628
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.740
And that this though what's happened in Seattle,

629
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:41.741
in Colorado and Washington DC is the first blip of this new movement that's

630
00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:43.990
going to spread across the country and,
and the,

631
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.390
the politicians are going to have to adapt because politicians are whores and

632
00:33:47.391 --> 00:33:49.270
that is the good thing about them.
They're,

633
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.220
their ideology is based entirely on which way the wind's blowing,

634
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:56.390
so because of that,
it's kind of cool.
It's,
it's a business,
right?

635
00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.380
Their prime objective is to win and get elected because not only them,

636
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.260
but all the people that worked with them campaigning for the last year.

637
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.540
They lose their jobs too.
Yeah,
right.

638
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.390
Get that Chris Christie fucker to see that guy.

639
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.740
He's still saying that marijuana is dangerous and addictive.
Meanwhile,

640
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.330
he's just ridiculously over obese.
They just thought,

641
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:18.770
I think it's so accurate.
He's so disgusting.
They just did.

642
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.180
They just did a report.

643
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:25.181
Rather they said he spent $82,000 and food at NFL Games of taxpayer's money.

644
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.270
Are you kidding me?
I did not see that bad.

645
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:33.530
$2,000 in food at NFL Games.
Wow.

646
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.330
This fucking guy who is morbidly obese just overflowing out of his shirts and

647
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:38.991
his pants.

648
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:43.040
Just clear food addiction and eating addiction like clearly a hundred percent by

649
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:45.710
the way.
You know,
I had this guy,
Dr Dan Engle.

650
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:48.030
Leon on the other day was talking about the,

651
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:52.250
he works with people with addictions and trying to treat these addictions like

652
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.260
food addictions and sugar addictions in particular,

653
00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:59.090
or one of the most difficult ones to treat because you've got to eat.

654
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.990
Everybody eats.
It's not like heroin,
like you'd kick heroin and no one's like,

655
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:05.960
dude,
you've got to do a little hair stay alive.

656
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.670
Like you don't have to do a little heroin.

657
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.160
Jamie and I were talking to before you arrived and food,
uh,

658
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:13.850
sugar processed sugar was artificially put into the majority of our foods,

659
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:16.600
like back in the 70s and eighties so that you have a taste for it.

660
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:17.870
That's why we're so addicted to like,

661
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.350
like it's in things you don't even think about.
Spaghetti sauce,
sandwich meats,

662
00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:23.690
things like that.
So you look,
you're like the sugar in this.

663
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:26.330
Like it's an everything.
I try to,

664
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.210
I go through the rings around my cabin to go two weeks without sugar.

665
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.740
I've never succeeded.
I the,
I went a whole month without beating off ones.

666
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.220
Shut up.
I'm documented it on my blog,
my website.

667
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.980
I would fail that addiction test.
Why did it because I had to do it,
you know,

668
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.620
I didn't have to do it,
but I had to do it because I said I was going to do it.

669
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.260
Yeah.
You know,
and I wrote about it,
but it was just ridiculous.

670
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.350
You find yourself becoming more aggressive more?
No,
I'm just horny all the time.

671
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.600
Like people give me a hug and I get a hard fuck when you,

672
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.980
you say you're not going to tell,

673
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:58.650
you don't realize like how much jerking off is like maintenance.

674
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.940
Like it keeps you clear.
Like you don't have the,

675
00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:04.650
this overwhelming need,

676
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:09.840
this pulsating overwhelming need,
you know,
and you,
uh,
if you,

677
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.950
if you go 30 days without beating off,
you'll kind of understand that.

678
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:16.530
And most people don't do that unless they have like a really low sex drive.

679
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.210
Never gone that long.
But sugar,
um,
I've never tried.

680
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.070
I sh I have very much limit my sugar,
my sugar try that too.

681
00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:28.410
But I've tried a few weeks just to really cut it,

682
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:32.400
like really look at everything and,
and other than even then it,

683
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.820
I'd never succeeded.
But like fruit and stuff like at least natural sugar.

684
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:37.470
I wasn't as much,
but just process.
I'm like,

685
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:39.100
I'm going to try to get rid of nothing process.

686
00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:42.360
But then I have kids and stuff and the cupboards full of Shit and then I'm like,

687
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.411
ah,
fuck it.

688
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:47.700
I'll grab one of these the other day my wife brought home Krispy Kreme donuts.

689
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:51.150
Those are crap.
Those already been,
what have you done?

690
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.670
There's no way of those kids.
Those came in the house.
I crushed the whole thing.

691
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.320
They're brutal.
They're brutal.
The good.
Um,

692
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.070
you've got to get the cream filled ones because the,
the regular ones,

693
00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:03.990
they're only good like right when they come out of the oven.

694
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.650
But the regular ones,
the cream filled ones are good for days.

695
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.860
I haven't had those ones lays cream filled.
So we don't have Krispy Kremes.

696
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.080
Not In Canada too much.
We have Tim Horton's.

697
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.730
Tim Horton's can't carry Krispy Kremes jock strap.
Okay.

698
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.290
That's a fellow I've eaten 10 horny Tim Horton's donuts there.
Dog Shit.

699
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.750
There are eye.
They're okay.
They're good.
No,

700
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.060
they're way better than Dunkin donuts.
That's not true at all.

701
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.950
It's just fucking disgusting.
Boston cream donuts,
those,
those fucking,

702
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:37.690
you ever have one of those off sessions?

703
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.430
Canadians are so into being Canadian
as love being Canadian.

704
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.400
We are proud.
It's a great country.
Don't get me wrong.

705
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.940
My favorite country other than America without a doubt as Canada and they,

706
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:54.090
they're the nicest people and it's one of the reasons why it's so difficult to

707
00:37:54.091 --> 00:37:55.530
get up there.
That's why people always say,

708
00:37:55.531 --> 00:38:00.120
when are you gonna Bring Joey [inaudible]?
Joey Diaz has armed kidnapping on his,

709
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.750
on his resume.
It's very fucking tough to get into Canada with arm kit.

710
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:05.910
You can't even get into Canada if you had a bar fight,
you know.

711
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:08.070
Well now both countries,
same in the US.

712
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.670
If you have a DUI you can't come to the United States from Canada and you can't

713
00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:16.290
come from the US to Canada.
Do you have a Dui?
You are restricted from travel.

714
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.720
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a good one.

715
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.620
You know if we could keep more people from driving trunk it would be a way

716
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:23.280
better place.

717
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.170
But Canada is particularly stringent on the amount of people and the type of

718
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:29.010
people that lets in.

719
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:31.410
And it's one of the reasons why I've always said it's such a nice country.

720
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.610
It's like you guys like you value good behavior up there,
you value nice people.

721
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.980
Well another thing that's a big advantage for us,

722
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:42.100
like when people make comparisons because the culture is very similar in some

723
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:43.900
ways and very different in a lot of ways.

724
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:47.560
I find the United States is very polarized and they're like,
it's much more like,

725
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.910
are you a Republican or Democrat?
Are you left or right?

726
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.000
Or you're religious or not.
Not to say that doesn't exist in Canada.

727
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.350
I don't find it as intense as it is in the United States,

728
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:59.200
but we have such a small population.
Right?
Right.

729
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.170
Like there was more people in the state of California then our entire country,

730
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:03.700
which is really weird.

731
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.030
So we don't have to deal like when you get more and more people,
you know,

732
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.770
things get more and more complicated.

733
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:12.380
There's different social structures and history and religious and bands.

734
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.580
You guys are dealing with Shitty donuts.
So there's that too.

735
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.980
You're always having to,
Tim,
why don't these are awesome,
awesome,
awesome.

736
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.570
Barely edible.
This much,
much better.

737
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:28.170
I highly disagree on that.
And they're good.
Mad there.

738
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.990
I'll give Krispy Kremes are awesome,
but Timmies are a close second.

739
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.920
Not even no for up there.
You have no choices.

740
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.880
What else you got?
I tried Dunkin donuts when I lived in New York.

741
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.140
Put dairies disgusting.

742
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.980
No idea what you're talking about when you're making me make me sick.

743
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.370
Isn't it weird like we would give a fuck if you enjoy something.
I don't.

744
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:55.330
It's like that's fighting words.
You did somebody,
Timmy,
you use a windows dude,

745
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:57.670
you should get a Mac.
Oh I don't even get in.

746
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.760
I just have an old beat up laptop that's still survived and it's a Mac.

747
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.580
I've had it for like eight years.
Still works fine.
People get mad at you.

748
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.000
Well at least now with the new film we're in production for you.

749
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.480
Like cause you backup all your footage.
So we bought one through the production.

750
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:12.550
So I get that one.
When it's done,
I'll take what?

751
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:14.760
Operating system using feral hacks house cat.

752
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:20.650
I have a really old one.
It still has,

753
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.640
it still has one of those DVD drives and so where you can actually put one of

754
00:40:24.641 --> 00:40:27.100
those among my other laptop.
This one doesn't have it.

755
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.890
It has like I have a USB one which I've never used.

756
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.740
I bought it like when I'm like,
I'm definitely gonna need this.

757
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.370
I've never used it.
Once I do,
DVDs are done.
They're done.

758
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.800
It's just like those goddamn floppy disks.
When they,

759
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.320
when they got rid of the floppy disks,
everybody's like,
Steve Jobs.

760
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:45.010
The fuck is wrong with you.
Are you crazy?
No floppy disk,

761
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.670
and then he was right.
They are interesting in the movie industry,

762
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:50.710
those they haven't been able to recover.

763
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.910
What DVDs used to make like Dow digital downloads not there.

764
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.680
It hasn't been.
It's called piracy son.
Yeah,
it up.

765
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.190
If anyone knows that.

766
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:05.191
I know like the union had been seen millions of times and we still hadn't got

767
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:09.510
into the green with that one.
Wow.
Millions of times where it gets crazy.

768
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.430
There's just 10 sec.
If we just got 10 cents a download,

769
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:17.170
we would be doing really good.
You'd be rich as fuck rich as fuck.
It's like five,

770
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.280
5 million.

771
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.950
If you look at all the different places where it's been illegally download,

772
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:21.221
we've,

773
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.950
we stopped calculate where you just add up on youtube and on it's like five,

774
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:27.640
6 million.
That's a real issue when it comes to making a documentary isn't it?

775
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:31.210
Getting the funding really tough cause docs are,

776
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:34.310
in Canada at least we're fortunate because we have like the tax credit system

777
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.670
<v 0>and there's a lot of grant programs so that Canadian artists can still survive.</v>

778
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.280
The problem with that is you have Canadian content laws.
Yeah.

779
00:41:41.281 --> 00:41:46.281
So you got some dog shit that sneak through sneaks through.

780
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.180
I wouldn't say a sneaker,
I'd say majority it is,
but docs,

781
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:54.590
the good thing is is all it has to be to qualify as can con is as long as the

782
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:56.360
crew is Canadian producing it.
Right?

783
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.930
So like the culture high is a Canadian content film,

784
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:02.120
but that's doesn't feel very Canadian.
Right?

785
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:07.070
It's much more about us politics and it's all featuring us and international

786
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:10.340
interviews.
Right.
Docs is the one that really works well for it.

787
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.630
You guys have that Mark Emery guy up there too,
which is a strange case.

788
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.730
This guy,
cause it's very polarizing on both sides in both ways.

789
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.180
Like that guy was selling seeds which were totally legal in your country and the

790
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.900
local law enforcement was not willing to prosecute him.

791
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.360
So the DEA came in to extradite him and we talked about that in,

792
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:37.070
in the union where it was just like,
look,

793
00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:40.460
it's the same as if we bought a machine gun from the United States,

794
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.080
not legal in Canada.
Right.

795
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.960
But we don't extradite the guy that bought it to the United State or like you

796
00:42:45.961 --> 00:42:49.040
know,
we don't go to the United States and say,
Hey your guy sold a gun to Canada.

797
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.880
He has to come up and serve time in Canada.
We arrest the guy that bought it.

798
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.540
So with the seeds,
the same thing with mark.
Right.
And he was giving,

799
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.190
he was paying taxes to the government.

800
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:00.690
They had no issue on the seeds that he got arrested for.

801
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.380
And then he was giving to,
you know,

802
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.530
drug rehabilitation clinics and a whole bunch of things.

803
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:09.680
And almost like in that case the government's kind of in on it because they take

804
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:10.514
money.

805
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.840
Like you guys took the tax money and then you still sent him to the United

806
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.930
States.
The flask assign the official release to allow him.
Right.

807
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.680
Why would they do that?
That's where it was funny cause a lot of people,

808
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:22.670
I mean he,
you know,

809
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.610
mark Emery is really aggressive and he wanted to be a martyr and he,

810
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.180
that's the polarizing aspect and it gets tough because a lot of people,
you know,

811
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.690
didn't like the way he did things but the,
you know,

812
00:43:32.691 --> 00:43:35.240
some people that were not in the argument where too much,

813
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:38.840
we're just against giving up a Canadian citizen to go serve time over there.

814
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:39.770
They were like,
you should be.

815
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.130
That was the one that everyone was kind of on the side being like that shouldn't

816
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:46.760
be done.
You know,
we should not send him over there for laws that,
you know,

817
00:43:46.761 --> 00:43:49.760
he didn't order the seed.
Somebody else ordered it to the United States.

818
00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:52.250
He shouldn't be sent down there to go serve his time.

819
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.360
He just got out of prison like a year ago.
Yeah,
and he's,
you know,

820
00:43:56.361 --> 00:44:01.070
he's back to his old ways and smoking pot and making videos and all this stuff.

821
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:04.430
I mean,
they didn't put a dent in it.
They actually did make him a martyr.

822
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.120
You know,
he was in the transcripts we showed in the union did,

823
00:44:07.121 --> 00:44:09.980
they said this is a dent to the legalization movement and everything.

824
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:13.970
It was much more of a political arrest for the DEA than it was anything else.

825
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:17.960
And actually the prosecutor that help send him to the has actually come out

826
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:20.750
recently and said we should change marijuana laws and not put people,

827
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:24.920
he still thinks that sending mark Emery way was the right thing to do as a

828
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:25.581
prosecutor.

829
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:29.300
But he thinks that the law should now be changed because they're draconian and

830
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.010
they really aren't.
I mean it's,
there's argument about

831
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.210
<v 1>it.
There's no,
no one can make except dancy gray is,</v>

832
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:41.160
did you see her argument with two Chainz?
Yes.
I see all her stuff.

833
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:44.250
I post them and tweet them.
They always get a good reaction with her.

834
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.860
She's adorable.
She's almost like a plant.

835
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.100
She's almost like a plant by the marijuana industry to try it.

836
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:53.850
I like the marijuana community to try to like make the ultimate dumb villain

837
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.320
that epitomizes the anti legalization movement.

838
00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:02.750
Marijuana makes you fat and lazy,

839
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.410
but then she'll say the exact opposite of that.
Right.
You SOC

840
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.630
ray bests.
Exactly.
Well,
yeah.
I,

841
00:45:11.631 --> 00:45:14.410
I have to believe with her that she doesn't even believe all of her by,

842
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.250
I have to think it's like when you had Dr. Carl Hart on the show and he talked

843
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:21.660
about going on,
um,
dark bill O'Reilly O'Reilly.
Yeah.
Right.

844
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:24.390
And he was saying how he was great right before we started rolling camera.

845
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.520
Then when we rolled camera,
he was totally different.
Right.

846
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:29.460
And he was trying to get at me and he was living the character.

847
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.060
I'd have to think that Naz Nancy grace is the same.
No,

848
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:34.050
I think you're probably right.

849
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:38.220
I think there's a lot of those folks that are in that public eye,
um,

850
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:42.960
that are involved in the business of getting eyes on them and they know the

851
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.870
controversy is what sells this.
That's how you got to do it.

852
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.340
You know they are Nancy grace,
the effects of Nancy grace.

853
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.850
I want to hear this.
Nancy.
Nancy grace.

854
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.350
Look at her.
Nancy grace.

855
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.600
<v 3>Oh wows in evidence that Trayvon Martin did have marijuana in his system at the</v>

856
00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:09.830
time he died.
What difference,
if any,
does that make?

857
00:46:09.831 --> 00:46:13.070
Because I've seen too many felonies.

858
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:18.130
She's on hot sales are growing part like this guy up in Connecticut.

859
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.000
To me it means that he is less likely to pick a fight with someone.
I mean,

860
00:46:23.001 --> 00:46:27.080
people on pot shoot each other.
Isn't it true that when you smoke pot,

861
00:46:27.081 --> 00:46:32.081
you just want to lay on the sofa and eight people on pot kill families wipe out

862
00:46:32.721 --> 00:46:36.540
a whole family.
The
connotation,

863
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:42.920
lethargy with the munchies with wanting to eat.

864
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.420
We're being laid back,
not with chasing somebody down,

865
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.250
jumping out from behind bushes,

866
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:52.900
beating when the head till till they're pulpy and,
and,

867
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.400
and basically starting mortal Kombat.

868
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.450
That's not what you typically equate with.
Smoking a Doobie.

869
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.253
That's hilarious.

870
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.110
Or I've gotta be smoking or I've got to be high on pot.

871
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.040
<v 1>Can you clearly say Nancy won the debate.
They're debating herself.</v>

872
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:16.180
I feel like Nancy had all the good points.

873
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:21.580
Yeah.
Well,
she's a business person.
You know,
that's her business is Nancy grace.

874
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.180
The business of Bill O'reilly is bill O'Reilly's got to get in your face and

875
00:47:25.181 --> 00:47:30.181
call you a moron and shut you up because bill O'Reilly is to that seven year old

876
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:35.530
man with a hearing aid.
That's his,
uh,
his audience,
that scared man,

877
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:39.010
that's afraid that Mexicans are gonna move into his neighborhood and his hands

878
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:42.940
are shaking when he goes,
where's my remote remote?
Where's the remote?

879
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.940
And the wife is just a prisoner of this guy's fucking,
you know,

880
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.470
no one's allowed to touch the remote for this TV.
That's the bill O'Reilly Fan.

881
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:52.840
He just said,
Myers,
Bill O'Reilly.
Well,
that was,
you know,

882
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.440
that was part of that Brett really wanted to tackle in indirect,
in the culture.

883
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.690
I was that part of the media.
Right.

884
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:02.380
And how it's become such a business and Jank breaks that down really great in

885
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:06.010
the film of like breaking down in the history of media and how the airwaves were

886
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:09.580
originally given to get news.
We'll give you the airways,
you give us news,

887
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:13.090
but then anytime they tackle the subject that kind of conflicted with the

888
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:15.520
political views of Washington and they're like,
okay,
wait a minute,

889
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:17.510
we don't want you talking about that news.
Right?

890
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.700
We don't want you talking about that.

891
00:48:18.701 --> 00:48:21.610
And then they realize they can make money off it and started getting sponsors

892
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:23.770
and then it was like,
okay,
well we can't touch subjects like this.

893
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:25.630
And when you had Jank on your show,

894
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:30.160
we touch on that whole MSNBC thing that he had right where he goes in and he

895
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:33.130
started pushing buttons of both sides and saying other both corrupt and then

896
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.140
systematically corrupt.
Right?

897
00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:39.130
Because you're funded by people to argue points based on campaign money that you

898
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:42.730
got is a great point that Brett fought hard to have in the film,

899
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:45.550
that the audience seemed to really take two when it released.

900
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:49.060
So it illuminates the issue.
The issue is,

901
00:48:49.061 --> 00:48:50.590
it's not as clear as like,

902
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.220
some people think this is bad for you and some people think this is good for
you.

903
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.010
And you know,
here's the debatable evidence.
It's not,

904
00:48:57.011 --> 00:48:59.590
there's no debatable evidence.
You look at the evidence,
you go,
okay,

905
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:03.280
well there's no one has ever died from it ever.

906
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.880
No one has ever got cancer from it ever.
No one.

907
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:10.470
I mean all this idea like the,
I love when they start going like,
uh,

908
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.910
what's his name?
Gabor Montay.
How do you say his name?
Gabber medtech.
Yeah.

909
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.410
I've only seen it written.
I haven't heard it.
Trust me.
We were at the same thing.

910
00:49:17.411 --> 00:49:18.960
I would tell him we met him.
Yeah.
Um,

911
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:24.430
one of the things that he talked about was the instances of psychosis and which

912
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:26.680
is fascinating because you know,
they're both,

913
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:31.830
it's caused sock psychotic episodes and some people,

914
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.130
no,
it actually doesn't.

915
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.990
They're the uniform number of psychotic episodes and people is pretty much it.

916
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:41.560
It's in line with the population and if you have a hundred people,

917
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.230
one of those people is going to have issues and,
and when,

918
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:49.150
if you have a hundred people that smoke pot and one of those peoples has issues,

919
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.630
you can't correlate that with pot.
You just can't because breakdown name,

920
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.860
we break down the schizophrenia clip.
We have like a two minute clip.

921
00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:00.160
I don't know,
but like did we have to Jamie?
It's on youtube.

922
00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:03.460
If you just go the culture I schizophrenia and it's got all of them breaking in

923
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:07.360
my head because you guys did a great job with that documentary and I want more

924
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:11.200
people to see it.
It's just more the more these things get out there,

925
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:14.650
the more people see this.
More people see the union and there's,

926
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:15.820
there's so many of them now.

927
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:18.700
There's so many of these documentaries now it's just,
well and explain this,

928
00:50:18.701 --> 00:50:22.030
let's play this.
Schizophrenia.

929
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:27.150
Schizophrenia just wants split and you will come into

930
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.713
<v 4>wait.</v>

931
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.870
The more you mess with cannabis,
the more it can mess with your mind.

932
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:44.510
Even worse than the UK first seven years as a research and were devoted to a

933
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.780
schizophrenia.
I can tell you that is ridiculous.

934
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.980
We looked at the evidence.

935
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.870
I think we must have gone through about 2000 papers and it doesn't cost

936
00:50:54.871 --> 00:50:55.704
schizophrenia.

937
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.250
Maybe there are some individuals with schizophrenia in which the illness is

938
00:50:59.251 --> 00:51:02.400
brought on perhaps a little earlier because they smoke cannabis.

939
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.390
There are often is what's called an a precipitating event,

940
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.730
a precipitating event or something like an important loss of a person,

941
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.950
a severe car accident.

942
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:19.430
It certainly can be exacerbated by a number of drugs you know are bad alcohol

943
00:51:20.101 --> 00:51:25.101
trip that could serve as a precipitating event to the fact is schizophrenia has

944
00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:31.281
a prevalence of about 1% the world around cannabis use,

945
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.810
but start with a sixties it's gone up like that.

946
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.880
So you've introduced this new thing.

947
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:43.740
If it's schizophrenia Janick we should see a significant uptick in

948
00:51:43.741 --> 00:51:48.420
schizophrenia.
We should see more people with schizophrenia,
schizophrenia,

949
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.310
and stay just like that.

950
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.910
In all of the epidemiologic studies that I'm aware of,

951
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.590
there is no uptick.

952
00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.900
So if marijuana causes schizophrenia,
it was introduced.

953
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.510
Now we should have more schizophrenia.
We don't see that.

954
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.480
We will shortly see sub a little rise and I'd given the numbers of people who

955
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:10.470
use this,
you really,

956
00:52:10.471 --> 00:52:14.880
they need to strip this back and address this from a neutral platform to

957
00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:15.720
understand it.

958
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:20.070
Anything to do with mental health is such a tenuous issue.

959
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:25.100
Build up on different contributing factors and by applying it all to cannabis,

960
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:29.550
you are possibly doing more harm because you are negating or all these other

961
00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:31.200
fighters that certainly prior power.

962
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.860
<v 0>Yeah,
that's,
that guys summed it up perfectly,</v>

963
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:39.570
perfectly negating all those other factors.
Life is,
uh,
you know,

964
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.400
it's a series of factors and that is doing much more harm because you're not

965
00:52:44.401 --> 00:52:46.980
looking at all the other things.
You're trying to find the gist.

966
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.800
It's because of this.
It's because of that,
right.
Instead of,
you know,

967
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.640
looking at the broader picture like,
Oh,
maybe there was mental abuse,

968
00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:55.080
maybe there's neglect as a child,

969
00:52:55.081 --> 00:52:59.280
and then gabber really does a great thing where he talks about addiction and how

970
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:03.960
early childhood development and how the brain grows so rapidly that it develops,

971
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:04.591
you know,

972
00:53:04.591 --> 00:53:08.280
certain things that those end up becoming the crutch for you later on because

973
00:53:08.281 --> 00:53:10.650
you had neglect when you were younger or when you had this,
right.

974
00:53:10.651 --> 00:53:13.500
It stems so much from early childhood.
In fact,

975
00:53:13.501 --> 00:53:17.790
he did a study because he was a Holocaust survivor,
right?
His family,

976
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:20.640
they escaped.
And when he was perfectly healthy baby,

977
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:22.500
then all of a sudden he became really colicky.

978
00:53:22.501 --> 00:53:26.280
So his mother called their physician was like,
oh my God,
I know he's not slow.

979
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:29.550
He's screaming all night.
And the doctor said,
well,
Mrs Mat,
Hey,

980
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.030
if you don't mind me asking your Jewish correct?
And she said,
yeah,

981
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.690
what does that have to do with anything?
He said,

982
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:36.630
we have an epidemic of Jewish babies,
uh,

983
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:39.030
that our call lucky now ever since the war has been announced.

984
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.430
And explain what college he is for.
People don't have kids call it.

985
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:45.490
He is like kids that just nonstop cry.
They're always like,
as a cold call,
lucky.

986
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.770
I don't know.
We'd have to look that up.
Jam Not done,
but they like,

987
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.900
I've never experienced it with my children,
fortunately,

988
00:53:51.901 --> 00:53:54.780
but I've had parents that literally said they see how they could go to purse

989
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:57.780
martem depression.
They just,
the kids do not sleep.
They're always uncomfortable.

990
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:00.300
Screaming like crazy all night,
like eight,

991
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:02.880
12 hours a day to where you think they're going to scream themselves to where

992
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:04.980
their heart might stop.
Right.
It's panicky.
You get,

993
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:09.030
so the physician hasn't announced that and Gabber looked at the study and be

994
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.690
like,
well,
what would infants or children know about the war and Hitler?

995
00:54:12.691 --> 00:54:15.270
Why would that make them call lucky?
Well,
what are children?

996
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.020
What's the only thing they're growing on him to absorbing at that young age?

997
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.800
Their parents who are now stressed,
they're in fear,

998
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.840
they're scared of what's going to happen in the war.

999
00:54:24.841 --> 00:54:27.510
They're scared about going to prison camps and that fear,

1000
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:31.830
intention and arguments and everything else is already affecting the young child

1001
00:54:31.831 --> 00:54:35.840
to the point where they start to become like they can feel that,
right?
Like,

1002
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:39.990
and he goes on that the,
I don't want to just keep running clips,

1003
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:41.970
but there's another great clip if people want to go look,

1004
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:45.990
the business insider picked it up,
the addiction side of the Gab or breaks down.

1005
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:50.130
So con like he does it like to put in one sentence,
he says it this way.
He says,

1006
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:50.851
you know,

1007
00:54:50.851 --> 00:54:55.440
although the addiction itself is a problem and we should be concerned about it,

1008
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:56.850
it's not the problem.

1009
00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.720
It's the addicts attempt to solve a problem in the first place.
Yeah.

1010
00:55:00.721 --> 00:55:03.540
That is a really good bit.
Uh,
that really good clip rather.

1011
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:08.541
And the the the talk about genes and then how it affects the way genes express

1012
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:12.240
themselves.
Like that's really crazy.
Like I didn't even know that.

1013
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.153
We didn't know that.

1014
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.160
Like I remember Alma actually can make you addicted to things and,
and uh,

1015
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:18.930
the childhood it,

1016
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.130
there's a study that he references that showed that children that had had,

1017
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.410
you know,
lost in the family divorce abuse,

1018
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:30.300
we're 600 times greater to become,
go to business.

1019
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:35.400
If you go business insider,
the culture high,
it has the,
the addiction clip.
Yeah.

1020
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:40.260
I just think that all of this information like this what we just played about

1021
00:55:40.261 --> 00:55:45.261
schizophrenia and this about addiction and genetics and the ever the evidence

1022
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:50.220
now it's just so overwhelming that when you have a Nancy grace or you have,

1023
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.490
you know,
like the old Ronald Reagan clip,
it becomes almost comedy.

1024
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.470
It's like it's so proposed.
But the thing is like,

1025
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:58.550
and you had a Dr. Carl Hart talked about when he was on your podcast though,

1026
00:55:58.551 --> 00:56:02.340
is they don't want to come off like it sucks going on their show because that's

1027
00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:04.830
their realm where they can get you on points and they can get,

1028
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:07.830
because sometimes you can get a certain doctor like Gabber Matay if you can let

1029
00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.800
them talk and really explain it,
he'll sue are you?

1030
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.430
But if you were to debate and get points that when and over shout,

1031
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:17.640
he might not come off what those shows are a joke man.

1032
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:21.630
Any of those shows where they have like Anderson Cooper standing there and he's

1033
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:23.980
talking to five different people that are in five

1034
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.590
<v 2>different locations and they're all yelling in your bases.</v>

1035
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:31.210
Then the arguably the worst way to communicate ever.

1036
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.110
Like get anyone of those fucks on a podcast and sit down with them for three

1037
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:38.440
hours and then you'd find out what they're really like.
Like Nancy Grace.

1038
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.800
You Imagine Nancy grace on a podcast talking about marijuana for three hours to

1039
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.280
do.
You know,
if she couldn't leave,
if she couldn't leave,
she couldn't go.

1040
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.250
This conversation is nonsense.

1041
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:52.260
Mr. Rowe in your wasting my time.

1042
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.360
Can we set up a pay per view event to that and make that have run away?

1043
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.690
She would not.
They would not come.
There's no way she would because if she did,

1044
00:56:58.691 --> 00:57:01.000
I mean you wouldn't have to yell at her.
You wouldn't have to get angry.

1045
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:02.950
You would just break it down over and over again.

1046
00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:05.160
Do you know how ridiculous is it?
Like show her the facts.

1047
00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:08.310
Show her her own debate against herself.

1048
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.520
All these people that are doing this fat.
Fuck Christie,
get that dummy.

1049
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.380
You know I'm,
I'm a fat shamer.

1050
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.090
I'll tell you right now a fat shame the fuck out of that fat.
Fuck.

1051
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:23.140
I don't believe in fat shaming.
I think it's nonsense.
It's Goddamn nonsense.

1052
00:57:23.141 --> 00:57:27.730
I'm not into it.
Um,
and that guy is a dangerous person.
Those,

1053
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:31.750
those words that come out of his mouth in a position of power will affect
people.

1054
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.570
There's young children that hear what he says.

1055
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.110
They listened to the news and they will start to believe that stupid shit little

1056
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:42.460
and people that are way more scared to admit maybe they made a mistake and

1057
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:46.660
correct it and we'll continue a lie and push that ideology on people for that.

1058
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:51.340
That is,
I mean you had Steven Pressfield on here,
but the,
the war of art,

1059
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.940
right?
Talked about that.
Like how resistance can push you.

1060
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:58.990
Like rather than overcoming that resistance,
admitting that there was a mistake,

1061
00:57:58.991 --> 00:58:01.690
like,
hey,
I was wrong.
Right.
I made a mistake,

1062
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:05.020
which is nice to see doctor Sanjay Gupta come out and at least like,
you know,

1063
00:58:05.021 --> 00:58:09.700
say like,
I was fundamentally wrong about the research I presented.
Yeah.
He's a,

1064
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.430
he's got a lot of courage for doing that.
But uh,
yeah,

1065
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.430
the denial of the truth is bad.

1066
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:17.680
Not just for the people that you're delivering the truth too,

1067
00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:20.050
but also to yourself.
Cause you know,

1068
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:21.970
in your heart of hearts that you're a bullshitter.

1069
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:27.100
If you are somehow or another pushing some nonsense,
false narrative,

1070
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:32.101
just because it reinforces what you've already said and you find that over and

1071
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:33.790
over again with humans.

1072
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:36.520
They just don't want to ever admit that they were incorrect or they got

1073
00:58:36.521 --> 00:58:41.190
bamboozled.
Scary.
I mean that's what keep me.
Did you see um,
the um,

1074
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.050
going clear documentary?
Yes.
Yes.
I did.
Just watched it the other day.

1075
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.160
God Damn Fascinating.

1076
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:50.080
But it sort of touches on that a bit because you see these people that we didn't

1077
00:58:50.081 --> 00:58:55.081
want to admit that this religion called crazy they'd gotten into was a bullshit.

1078
00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:00.280
The something someone created a really retarded science fiction author.

1079
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:03.160
Created a gigantic religions.
Yes.

1080
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.370
Actually give him props that he was able to just say religions are the most

1081
00:59:06.371 --> 00:59:07.900
profitable thing cause you don't have to pay tax.

1082
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:10.660
And I'm the science fiction writer and once to get whatever,

1083
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:12.370
what's the level like?
Oh v three.

1084
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.660
Then you get the notes from him and when the religion is,

1085
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.330
and I love where they have Paul Haggis on at that point.
And he's like,

1086
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:20.980
what the fuck is this?
He's like,

1087
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.641
<v 1>he's like,</v>

1088
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:26.960
I was into the all helping people and trying to make the world a better place

1089
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:29.060
and do all that.
He's like,
but once I read this,
he was like,

1090
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:33.610
I'm not into this whole thing.
The xy on ruler,
whenever z news,
he knew.

1091
00:59:33.611 --> 00:59:38.611
That's what we also kind of realize that the l Ron Hubbard himself was very much

1092
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:43.940
like very likely like having mental health issues and he was trying to self

1093
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:44.774
diagnose.
Yup.

1094
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.930
And that's why one of the things I actually like about Scientology and uh,

1095
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:52.690
you know,
I don't want to bash,

1096
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.910
I don't know enough about it to bash it other than the really scary retarded

1097
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:58.220
shit.
Yeah.
But I've,

1098
00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.430
I've known some people that have been in it and they've been like really goal

1099
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:06.050
oriented people and they really like have been focused and they like try to get

1100
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:08.510
their shit together.
And one of the guys that left,

1101
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.000
he said that he left Scientology as a religion,
but he still believed in it as a,

1102
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.460
as a,
as a practice,
as a practice for like mental,

1103
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.660
like awareness or for managing the mind.
You know,

1104
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:22.700
cause I think the lot of their principals,

1105
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:26.750
a lot of the ideas came from psychology and they came from,

1106
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.430
I mean he had some,

1107
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.790
some like almost like self remedy sort of ideas of how to like manage his

1108
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:38.840
craziness and manage his mind.
And I don't think it's all bad.

1109
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:43.430
No it but isn't that isn't that ultimately would like for to for to me I thought

1110
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.510
like all ideology,

1111
01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:48.530
like some of the ideas of like treating others as you'd want to be treated

1112
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:51.260
yourself.
Like isn't that what they all stem from?

1113
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:54.710
But then like Scientology and the film at least and other ones,

1114
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.950
then you get people in positions of power in those places.
Right.

1115
01:00:57.951 --> 01:01:01.400
And then it starts being done to know it's the way I depict these readings.

1116
01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:01.641
Right.

1117
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:06.340
And if you disobey then you burn in Hell or whatever your that's always like I

1118
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:09.580
read a lot of them.
Like I grew up around um,
uh,

1119
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.220
east Indians and seek and a lot of their stuff I liked were like the original

1120
01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:16.700
seat temples had all four entrances saying all people are welcome,
right?

1121
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:18.980
And then all rivers essentially flow to the ocean.

1122
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:22.250
Meaning there's no one right way to find enlightenment or be a better person.

1123
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.670
And,
but then,
you know,
I'm a big fan of the Sikh religion.
Yeah.

1124
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.880
I've met a lot of those guys.
They're very cool.
I wish they would cut their hair

1125
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:35.060
so much.
So much of what they're doing is like,
I liked the way they behave.

1126
01:01:35.061 --> 01:01:39.820
I like the,
they're not,
they don't proselytize and not rude about it,
you know?

1127
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.210
And when they dress up for their weddings,

1128
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.180
their shit looks way better than a Tux.
Yeah.

1129
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.950
I think they have some crazy marijuana drink to that someone taught,

1130
01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:46.784
I think it's called,

1131
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.490
I think it's called Bang Bha and June or something like that.

1132
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.960
But it's like marijuana mixed with yogurt.
There's like a certain sex of,
yeah.

1133
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.850
See if he could find that.
Jeremy,
there's certain sex of,
uh,
of the Sikhs who,

1134
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:03.620
uh,
they,
they drink this marijuana yogurt combinations like Hash and yogurt.

1135
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:05.450
I just think it's sweet.
And when they go to the wedding,

1136
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:09.350
they have the fucking sword and it go pawn their thing.
Like we get,

1137
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:13.280
we get a toxin,
a tie.
They just had like emperors with weapons.
I was like,

1138
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:17.030
well you call it by,
it's like I'd much rather dress like that.
Yeah,
no,
they,

1139
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.190
I mean I'm like,
here it is B h a n g

1140
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.300
<v 2>a beverage prepared from the leaves and flowers of the female cannabis plant has</v>

1141
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:28.020
a long history of use in the Indian sub continent with the buds of the plant

1142
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:32.100
maturing the spring,
the preparation of Ba,
B.
H.
A.
N.
G,

1143
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:33.120
I think it's called Bong.

1144
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.740
Bong has traditionally been associated with the harvest festivals of old La

1145
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:42.120
[inaudible] or Holly in March.

1146
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:44.470
And the vice,
uh,

1147
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:48.780
how you say that vice suck he vice hockey ice hockey in April.

1148
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.380
Uh,
although drugs and alcohol per bid in Chic Ism,

1149
01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.700
not n I.
A H a n g s knee hugs,
I dunno,

1150
01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:00.660
are traditionally very fond of Bong,
which they call suck.

1151
01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:04.710
Need Don meaning giver of peace.
That's right.

1152
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.290
Or a Sukkah prosad or IEP giver.

1153
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.160
Yeah.
I agree with all those things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Seeks got it right.
Yep.

1154
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:18.420
I take the Bong,
be happy,
be happy,
be happy.

1155
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.380
Let's play that a thing about jeans man cause he is a business insight because

1156
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:27.300
this is a pretty pretty powerful stuff.
Addiction,

1157
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.260
<v 6>the most frequently cited perceived harm associated with marijuana.
Sexy voice.</v>

1158
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:35.640
It's addiction.
Not Bad enough that it's addictive.
Highly addictive.
Right,

1159
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:38.520
because I believe it is addictive and it leads to more serious drugs,

1160
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:42.390
but in order to understand addiction in relation to marijuana,

1161
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:46.560
one must first have an understanding of the psychology behind addiction in the

1162
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:50.430
first place.
It's interesting to see or to ask who becomes addicted.

1163
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.120
People can have sex with them and they get to it.
They can go shopping,

1164
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:57.900
but some people become severely addicted to all these pursuits.

1165
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.000
Is a pack of cards addictive?
Well no or yes,
depending on the individual,

1166
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.910
so it's the same process no matter what the addiction is.

1167
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.390
The only difference is really is that the substance that act is getting the

1168
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.960
dopamine from an outside substance.
It was the bigger addict is heading.

1169
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:15.510
It triggered from the particular behavior.

1170
01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:20.280
If I speak to a group of people or a thousand people and ask her,

1171
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:24.420
how many of you have addiction issues and to any substance and number of people

1172
01:04:24.421 --> 01:04:27.670
put their hand up in the see,
what did it do for you?
Not what was bad about it.

1173
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.430
You already know that,
but what did it do for you?

1174
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:31.800
What was positive in your experience with it?
Well,

1175
01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.530
if you give me a sense of peace,
it gave me a pain relief.

1176
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.700
He didn't need to feel more connected.
It made me more confident.

1177
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.120
I could speak now and interacts with other people.
In other words,

1178
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.670
the addict is just after wanting to be a normal human being,

1179
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.270
and the real question is what keeps them from having those qualities in their

1180
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:53.040
lives and what happened to them and so that the addiction should be seen not as

1181
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:55.950
the problem,
although it is a problem,
but it's not the problem.

1182
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.890
It's the addicts attempted to solve a problem in the first place.

1183
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.820
The ad just shot your experiences.

1184
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:06.830
Studies done in California looked at conditions such as physical,

1185
01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:09.000
sexual,
emotional abuse in the child's life.

1186
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:14.540
The loss of a parent through death or a rankers divorce or a pan being jailed or

1187
01:05:14.701 --> 01:05:17.620
mental illness in the parent or addiction of Panco violence in the family.

1188
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.990
And for each of these adverse childhood experiences,

1189
01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:24.340
the risk of addiction goes up exponentially by that than a male child has had

1190
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.140
six of these adverse experiences.

1191
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:31.350
His risk of having become a substance dependent injection using addict is 4600%

1192
01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:35.290
greater than that of a maybe 600 experiences.

1193
01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.360
It's because that trauma shapes the brain in such ways as to make the addictive

1194
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:42.190
substance is more appealing to the individual.

1195
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:47.680
That trauma also gives that person the pain that they will try to Dennis Kate

1196
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:50.560
from or to soothe to the addictive behaviors.

1197
01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.540
It's the social and emotional environment that shapes the actual biology of the

1198
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:57.800
brain.
So if you want to send somebody to addiction,

1199
01:05:57.801 --> 01:06:01.300
you need to look at what queen pain in their lives with a person who

1200
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:05.500
occasionally has a beer occasionally,
uh,
uh,
smokes marijuana,

1201
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.110
but genuinely they have no negative consequences.

1202
01:06:08.111 --> 01:06:10.810
It does not impair their head off.
It does not endanger their lives.

1203
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.230
It does not impair their personal relationships.

1204
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.120
You can't call those people addicts and you can't call those behaviors addictive

1205
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:21.550
critical distinction between the use of substances and the addiction to

1206
01:06:21.551 --> 01:06:24.460
substances,
which then brings us to the war on drugs.

1207
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.760
Basically the war on drugs is being waged against people that were abused and

1208
01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:30.190
traumatized and children and having mental health problems.

1209
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:35.610
There's enough punishment in there in the negative consequences of the addiction

1210
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:37.760
that we don't have to add punishment down to that.

1211
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:44.530
How great it would be nailed to a number of deaths around the world from

1212
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:48.910
cigarette consumption is five and a half million according to latest testaments

1213
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:49.923
annually.

1214
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:54.910
Cigarettes kill as many people as we killed and the Germans anti Jewish
genocidal

1215
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:58.560
<v 4>campaign,
so we have a Holocaust and anyway,</v>

1216
01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.900
oiling to cigarettes,

1217
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.190
you smoke more than two packs a day.

1218
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.690
He risk for developing lung cancer was 20 fold.

1219
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.900
That's 2000 preset based on the largest case control study ever done.

1220
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.360
There is no evidence that marijuana increased the risk of lung cancer.
Ooh,

1221
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:22.060
you got to have some consistency.
What was this?

1222
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:25.970
Was this guy a million different drugs that are sanctioned by the society that

1223
01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:29.360
don't have that happy ending that you take too much and you're fucked.

1224
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.780
I've got a friend who's armed.

1225
01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:34.940
He had to go to rehab for buying two boxes of Krispy Kremes every day and easy

1226
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:38.540
would Zelle Tim Horton's.
How's how he didn't say Tim Horton.

1227
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:43.100
He's from the UK.
Be Creams illegal.
I will fight any man by the way.

1228
01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:46.890
He suggests that and whether your buddy,
I got to get up salt and dying.

1229
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.580
You didn't use salt,
right?
Dude,
you fucked up with salt.

1230
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.940
If you just throw some salt on popcorn,
it's actually quite yummy,
you know,

1231
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:55.760
but what'd you do?
You stupid.
Fuck you ate a pound of salt and died.

1232
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.470
It doesn't mean we should outlaw salts.

1233
01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:00.080
Our society doesn't object to people jumping out of air.

1234
01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:02.480
I heard we heard him Graham Hancock through your podcast.

1235
01:08:02.481 --> 01:08:05.570
That's how we ended up getting interviewed on his sides.
It's so good.

1236
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.670
I love climbing mountains.

1237
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.520
Occasionally people pull off mountains and do harm to themselves.

1238
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.690
We're just rehashing all this stuff.
Yeah.

1239
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.040
Graham Hancock is actually involved in some,
a fascinating debate

1240
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.310
<v 2>right now with this Guy Zoe Huw os who's the head of,</v>

1241
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:22.250
I think the head of Egyptian antiquities.

1242
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.530
He's sort of the guy that dissemination did disseminator of information in Egypt

1243
01:08:27.531 --> 01:08:31.760
when it comes to like how people have access to the pyramids and all the

1244
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:34.340
different structures and he's been,
um,

1245
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:40.210
going at it with this guy because the guy is unable or unwilling to reconsider a

1246
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:45.480
lot of his statements about the age of a lot of the,
uh,

1247
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.550
ancient Egypt monoliths and all these different structures.
You know,

1248
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:53.030
they've got some clay tech-based putting it back fucking Hook into that,
right?

1249
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:56.450
He pretended he didn't know what go back.
Lee Tapi was,
and it's really funny the,

1250
01:08:56.451 --> 01:08:57.231
the,
the debate,

1251
01:08:57.231 --> 01:09:00.710
but since the similar thing like a guy who's been saying something for so long

1252
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.370
that there had,

1253
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.850
there were no cultures more than 5,000 years ago that were capable of

1254
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:06.650
sophisticated construction methods.

1255
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.580
And he's just said this for so long that now the evidence has come out go

1256
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:13.130
Beckley Tapi is 12,000 years old.
There's no doubt about it.

1257
01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:16.490
It is 100% there to Graham was saying there's two other ones that the initial

1258
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:17.271
tests are coming out.

1259
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:20.660
There was like a one in Australia and another one in Indonesia that was found

1260
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:24.320
and they said it's more and more like his original theory that he was poo pooed

1261
01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:27.740
on is now seeming to be more and more correct.
Oh yeah.

1262
01:09:27.741 --> 01:09:29.750
Between him and Randall Carlson,

1263
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:34.780
I mean they've really uncovered a lot of issues that there was trying to date

1264
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.220
the history of civilization.

1265
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:41.290
And the also the history of cataclysmic disasters was,

1266
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:44.150
it's very problematic because there's very little evidence and it's really

1267
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:46.670
difficult.
But over the past decade,

1268
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:51.710
more and more evidence from geologists like all this nuclear glass,

1269
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:53.750
if they're finding,
they do core samples,

1270
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:56.960
they dig down 12,000 for 12,000 years.

1271
01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.550
They get like a 12,000 and at 12,000 when they get to 12,000 years universally

1272
01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.730
across Europe and Asia,
they find this tree,
it's called,

1273
01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:08.990
I think it's called Triton night.
It's a nuclear glass and this nuclear glass,

1274
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:10.810
it exists in um,

1275
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.960
nuclear explosion test sites and also in meteor impacts.

1276
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.080
And so this stuff being spread out all over the place.

1277
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:23.410
They think that there was a pounding that this earth took a fucking pounding by

1278
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.510
meteors somewhere around 12,000 years ago.

1279
01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:31.511
And it could possibly have been the reason why the ice age ended and also could

1280
01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:35.330
be the reason why a massive amount of animals went extinct almost

1281
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.600
instantaneously.
Wooly mammoths,
saber tooth tigers,

1282
01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.580
like 60% of all land mammals.

1283
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:45.850
And it could be the reason why there's these ancient structures that date before

1284
01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:49.910
go Beckley Tapi or before you know it,
12,000 years ago,

1285
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:52.160
someone covered go back Lee [inaudible].

1286
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.280
That's how they know the reason they have a uniform age of the dirt that is

1287
01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:01.400
covering go Beckley Tapi so they explained it.

1288
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:03.650
This is all not fringe stuff either.
By the way.

1289
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:06.110
This is all like legit archeologists.

1290
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:10.880
They're absolutely certain that someone covered that 12,000 years ago.

1291
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.890
Well,
how old was it when they covered it?
No one,
no one knows.

1292
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.050
<v 0>So you don't think at least like uh,</v>

1293
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:21.360
can't test stone biocarbon leg like living things right that you can carbon
date,

1294
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.880
right?
That's how they tested the age of the pyramids.

1295
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:28.350
They tested the material that's between the stones and you know,

1296
01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.250
the bar,
the biological material,
whether it's wood or things along those lines.

1297
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.160
You could test that stuff and get pretty accurate readings.
He,

1298
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:38.940
this is what's so awesome about your podcast when we try to put a little bit of

1299
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:41.640
technology and the culture of how it's radically changing things like,

1300
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:44.430
I mean anyone I put onto your podcast gets hooked.

1301
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:47.910
And in fact I joke cause I've been in things where you bring on such interesting

1302
01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:51.510
people that got me to research things that I would have never looked into
before.

1303
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:52.450
Like go back lay,
tap pay.

1304
01:11:52.451 --> 01:11:55.950
The way that I even knew how to pronounce it was because we'd heard Graham

1305
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.100
Hancock on here.
We,
when he did his war on consciousness bit,
right.

1306
01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:01.080
And I were like,
we need to get that guy for the fucking film.

1307
01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:05.990
Like he has to be interviewed.
Um,
and then,
you know,
when I met with Graham Hang,

1308
01:12:05.991 --> 01:12:09.990
but the information and getting people to look at new ideas and great

1309
01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:13.710
perspectives and the platform of having people come on here for a good two,

1310
01:12:13.711 --> 01:12:17.550
three hours to really communicate things like that trickle effect.

1311
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.600
I've witnessed it.

1312
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.640
I've seen people that have like been inspired by your show that have lost 50.

1313
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.490
They're like,
man,
you're the guy that did the union,

1314
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:27.300
the culture high like Joe show.
I,
I,
I've used on it,
I've lost 60 pounds.

1315
01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.520
Like I love your stuff.
I've changed my perspective.

1316
01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:33.480
Like I've witnessed how it's already having a trickle effect of putting out,

1317
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:36.450
just getting new information out there,
getting people to think outside the box.

1318
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:40.560
And when we talked earlier about the ego kind of preventing you from sometimes

1319
01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:43.200
progressing well,
you have a lot of great people.

1320
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:45.660
You stress it on here all the time.
But other people,

1321
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.110
you have great interviews that do a two.
Like I found for me,
even at times,

1322
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:51.890
there's times when I'm like,
Hey,
you know what?
I should like self reflect.

1323
01:12:51.891 --> 01:12:54.780
I should get back into like boxing,
martial arts and you know,

1324
01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:58.350
maybe my ego is getting swelling.
Like it's,
it's good to get into that.

1325
01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:59.910
And I left going back to,

1326
01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.600
I boxed competitively when I was younger and I love going back in there now and

1327
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.940
getting beat up by these young guys cause it's really humbling.
Right.

1328
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:11.340
Bad for your brain though dude.
Super Bad for your boy.
You know,
I don't do it.

1329
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:13.470
What punches to the head or aren't good?
Try Yoga.

1330
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:19.060
I've been doing a lot of yoga lately.
Do that also for the ego to uh,

1331
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:22.390
my daughter wants to now get into Jujitsu so we're going to be great.
Yeah,

1332
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.010
I love Jujitsu.
Well,
what I love about Jujitsu is it doesn't have the,

1333
01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:29.570
the striking the head.
I mean I grew up a striker in my whole,

1334
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.500
I mean the reason why I became who I am I think is because of the trials and

1335
01:13:34.501 --> 01:13:37.900
tribulations of martial arts and going through competition and,
and all the,

1336
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.800
the fear and the overcoming that fear and all that stuff for me.

1337
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.010
And also like the self reflection,
the fact that it,

1338
01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:47.250
it makes you very objective about your abilities,
your you,

1339
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:50.220
you have to assess yourself in a very,
very clear way.

1340
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:52.620
Otherwise you're going to leave vulnerabilities and you're going to get hurt.

1341
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.400
I couldn't picture who I'd be without my boxing coach and putting like,

1342
01:13:56.401 --> 01:14:01.350
it was very good for me in my teenage years to um,
you know,
build confidence,

1343
01:14:01.351 --> 01:14:05.820
humility.
Because the first time you get in any sparring session,
you get lit up,

1344
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.270
lit up.
But that's health like other than the actual physical break,

1345
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:12.010
it's good to realize that you're not

1346
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.620
<v 1>the man at everything.
Right.
And when you can't be,</v>

1347
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:16.720
it takes a long time to be the men.
Do you mean,

1348
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:19.030
how do you think Floyd may where they got to be 48 no,

1349
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:23.440
and untouchable fucking countless hours in the gym.
I mean,

1350
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:26.710
you could call that guy a wife beater and a piece of shit and a dummy and he

1351
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:30.110
can't read and you probably write about all those things,
but what you,

1352
01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:34.310
you can't deny is the hard work that he put into that craft paid off.

1353
01:14:34.311 --> 01:14:37.390
And anyone that thinks that just going to figure that out right away.

1354
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.750
You're just not from the little bit of boxing I did.
There's,

1355
01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.910
you're not figuring it out right away.

1356
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:46.840
There's some physical gifts some people bring to the table,
unquestionably,

1357
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:50.680
but it's one of those things that you just have to work really hard at.

1358
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:55.000
And my belief is that when you work really hard at something and you get better

1359
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:55.481
at something,

1360
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:59.770
that thing becomes a vehicle for developing your human potential and then you

1361
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:04.771
can transfer that same sort of energy and focus and the lessons that you learned

1362
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:10.240
from that into all different walks of life.
The more extreme the situation is,

1363
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:11.950
the more difficult the task is.

1364
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:15.580
The more you learn about yourself and pursuing that task and the more beneficial

1365
01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:20.260
it is to you.
Outside of that task.
I couldn't agree more because you know,

1366
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.890
a lot of complications when I first did the union and getting into the industry

1367
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:24.820
and getting like,
you know,

1368
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:28.420
I want it to be able to storytell and make films and documentaries as my living,

1369
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:31.930
but it was the union.
I mean,
that was the first one,
first one,

1370
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.460
which you really knocked it out of the fucking park.
Thank you.

1371
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.860
It for your first project to be that good.
Thank you.
It was.

1372
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:42.370
But to make the finances and deal with Ia is,
you know,

1373
01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.770
you're very familiar with the film industry and not really,

1374
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.570
well the entertainment industry,
I'll say,
um,
you know,
took a while.
But you know,

1375
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.100
I even put it on my business cards.

1376
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:54.250
I put creative hustler because I think some of the things of overcoming

1377
01:15:54.251 --> 01:15:57.280
adversity and objections and the work you have to put in that I learned from

1378
01:15:57.281 --> 01:16:01.810
boxing and applied really well to being like constantly rejected,

1379
01:16:01.811 --> 01:16:03.220
being told you're idea's stupid.

1380
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:05.790
Like so many people have said the union would never work like your dominant

1381
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:09.190
[inaudible] who's wants to see this?
And then when it blew,

1382
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:13.930
I actually have our distributor took it as a favor to somebody else saying it

1383
01:16:13.931 --> 01:16:15.640
will never have any commercial success.

1384
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:19.870
What year did you do the 2007 that's crazy.
That was almost 10 years ago.

1385
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.530
That's so weird.
Eight years ago today.
Yeah.
Weird.

1386
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.660
And it's,
it's kind of amazing that that was your first film.
It's,

1387
01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:33.130
I look back now and I don't think I,
you know,
we couldn't have done any better.

1388
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:36.760
It was,
you know,
like you said,
a grand slam for our first film.

1389
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:40.390
And then since then I've been very fortunate to work on lots of other great
docs.

1390
01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:44.830
Like we worked on I and Bruce Lee,
then I did the good son with ray ray,
boom,

1391
01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:48.100
boom man sceney and you've watched the good son.
But I've heard amazing things.

1392
01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:51.160
A ball man that you want to talk about.
A guy that overcome adversity.

1393
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:55.540
Like you're a boxing fancy,
you know,
ray story there,
right?
As a kid,

1394
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:57.550
his dad was a number one contender,
right?

1395
01:16:57.551 --> 01:17:00.850
But then was drafted to the war and wasn't able to fight,
took shrapnel,

1396
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:05.050
came back into the ring,
was never the same fighter,
got beat up,
damaged design.

1397
01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:10.070
So at 10 years old,
10 ray makes a promise to his dad,
Dad,
I will win the world

1398
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.290
<v 0>title that you sold deserve to fight for.</v>

1399
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.570
And His dad's agreement don't go through.
It's so hard.

1400
01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.320
21 ray wins the world title and gives it to his dad and says it's finally where

1401
01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:19.880
it should be after 42 years.

1402
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.900
And then raise whole reason for getting into boxing was for righteous reasons to

1403
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:27.380
win a world title for his father.
And then in his third title defense,

1404
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.410
he takes the life of a father in Duke,
who Kim,

1405
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.670
when he kills Kim in the 14th round and Kim and only found out two or three

1406
01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:38.420
months before he was leaving to fight raid that his wife was pregnant.

1407
01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:41.090
He never even got to meet his son.
So in the good son,

1408
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:45.650
ray meets the son of the man that he killed 30 years later,

1409
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.130
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.

1410
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.930
Being a part of that,
Jen Reyes and then three months,
how does he handle it?

1411
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.080
Ray Ray had come to peace with it a long time ago.
Right?

1412
01:17:57.081 --> 01:17:59.690
But he really wanted to do this for Jeewan,
right?

1413
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:03.950
Cause g one wanted to meet him and wanted to put at rest and let him know that,

1414
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.230
you know,
it was just two warriors that went to war like,

1415
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:12.290
but for the ending of that fight,
you know the fight itself is a great fight.

1416
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.720
Like Duke who actually wrote in his notes,

1417
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:17.740
we found all this stuff cause we went to Korea and interviewed his trainer and I

1418
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.020
know the whole story and he actually wrote like,

1419
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:25.700
I will die in the ring tonight before I like that was his,
he came from nothing.

1420
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.850
And Korea,
like Barnum nor like right next to the North Korean border,

1421
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:32.780
slept in a pen with a horse like poor,
poor.
He fought to eat.

1422
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:38.000
So fighting ray was his chance at success.
He was not going to lose that fight.

1423
01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.170
And the first four rounds,
I mean he takes it to Ray,
right?
They go hard.
They go.

1424
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:47.930
So you know,
now going on this journey with these docs,
like I now I'm hooked.

1425
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.690
I don't want to do anything other than dogs because you meet Ray.

1426
01:18:50.691 --> 01:18:52.610
Ray is such an amazing individual.
Like,

1427
01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:55.820
I mean his brother was murdered three months before he won his world title.

1428
01:18:55.821 --> 01:18:58.580
That still did not detour him.
Right.
He stuck right in their,

1429
01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:02.420
won his first world title.
When you,
when you watched the WT,

1430
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.140
like if you were to script what happened to him with like him promising since he

1431
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.550
was 10 years old to win a world title,

1432
01:19:07.551 --> 01:19:09.890
his brother getting murdered three months before he wins.

1433
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:13.190
Then tragically taking the lightly,
you'd be like,
this is ridiculous script.

1434
01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:17.330
This is two fantastic like to bullshit.
But it really happened to him.

1435
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:21.380
Sometimes people's lives do play out like a ridiculous movie.

1436
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:26.690
Nothing but amazing.
Great things to say about [inaudible] amazing individual.

1437
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:30.110
Are you a fan of documentaries and he's like a Werner Herzog fan or anything?

1438
01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:35.260
I don't like any particular one person.
Just I do love docs.
So like I,

1439
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.710
for me when I was hooked,

1440
01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:38.690
and I think I might've said this last time was on a podcast,

1441
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:43.160
but when you're in that audience and your documentary has an emotional

1442
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:46.040
connection with the audience and you see them like when raise film,

1443
01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:47.420
but people are crying.
Like guys,

1444
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:50.810
I know there were full a motorcycle guys that I was friends with.

1445
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:52.670
Like they're crying and they're in front of them.
They're like,
dude,

1446
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:55.760
you made me cry.
And for all the boys,
and you know when Jason,

1447
01:19:55.761 --> 01:19:58.450
David and his son Jayden are on there with the things that people are quite like

1448
01:19:58.451 --> 01:20:01.970
and you see it has that impact and then you see it being,
you know,

1449
01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:04.160
universities and stuff.
People reaching out to me saying,

1450
01:20:04.161 --> 01:20:08.190
I used your film as a catalyst for my graduating argument and

1451
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:12.210
<v 1>it's tough to just want to go make an action film where everybody shooting each</v>

1452
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:13.021
other later.
Right?

1453
01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:17.940
Or it's tough when you see something that is not only a great story but has

1454
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:20.640
emotional impact,
right?
Well,
when done correctly,

1455
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:24.430
the medium of documentaries can have an amazing impact.
You can really get that.

1456
01:20:24.431 --> 01:20:25.170
One of the fast,

1457
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:30.030
I think it is the best as long as like it's done correctly.

1458
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:33.940
Like the information is like,
it's not Michael Morde.
Yeah,
I know what I mean.
Yes.

1459
01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.830
Unfortunately he,
he can do so good,
but then he pushes it too far for me.

1460
01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:42.350
I'm like,
leave the facts,
don't make someone look stupid.
It doesn't really help.

1461
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:46.020
Not necessarily bad to make certain people look stupid if they are stupid,

1462
01:20:46.021 --> 01:20:50.730
which you can't do is edit the little snippets to fill your narrative.

1463
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:54.820
And you know,
that's what he's guilty of.
You know,
like he's done.
He's,

1464
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.820
he's done more harm than good.

1465
01:20:56.821 --> 01:21:01.821
And he got lumped into that group of guys that people will automatically like

1466
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:04.020
knee jerk called deceptive.

1467
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:08.040
I think he did some great work and the bowling for Columbine was fascinating and

1468
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:10.860
Roger,
Roger and me I think has got the best one.
Yeah.

1469
01:21:10.861 --> 01:21:14.850
And that was his first one and I think that was the purest one.
And uh,

1470
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.010
and he really built the industry,
set the bar.

1471
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:21.660
He's like the Michael Jordan for it.
Like he,
he made feature docs mainstream.

1472
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.550
Yeah.
And like the bowling for Columbine,

1473
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:27.840
did he even get into mental health issues and prescription drugs and I don't

1474
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:31.500
think mostly about guns.
Mostly about guns.
It's not a gun issue.

1475
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:32.880
That's a mental health issue.

1476
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.580
I wrote this on Twitter but I'll stand by it to this country has a mental health

1477
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:42.210
issue disguise as a gun problem and that's,
that's really what it is.

1478
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.750
Well look at when we just had with Gab or explains right,

1479
01:21:44.751 --> 01:21:46.290
like it's early childhood and then yeah,

1480
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:51.060
if someone gets a dangerous weapon in their hands when they have mental
problems,

1481
01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:55.230
bad things can happen and it's so hard to fix people of that.
It's so hard once,

1482
01:21:55.231 --> 01:22:00.231
once your mind has gone down this awful path of addiction and childhood trauma

1483
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:06.060
and all these horrible life experiences and you have compensated or under

1484
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:09.150
compensated or over compensated and you're affected by that.

1485
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:13.650
And like the idea of becoming a balanced human being,
it seems like unattainable.

1486
01:22:13.651 --> 01:22:16.800
It seems it's,
it's incredibly difficult for the fears.
The crazy part,

1487
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:21.720
you don't know.
I'd,
one of my best friends going through went manic bipolar,

1488
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.130
right?
Like he had a big event that caused it and he was wrongly prescribed some

1489
01:22:26.131 --> 01:22:30.870
antidepressants and one summer he just started acting really sporadically out of

1490
01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:35.850
character.
Right.
But this was before,
this was in 2003 the same year that my,

1491
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:38.400
my father passed away.
So it wasn't like you,

1492
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:41.470
none of us put our finger on it right away.
Like,
oh you have a menu.

1493
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.410
Like people are just like,
you're being an asshole.
Like why did it change?
Why?

1494
01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:48.120
Why are you so spread?
Like cause it wasn't common knowledge like you don't,

1495
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.310
and people that have it happening at the time,

1496
01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:52.190
they don't wake up in the morning and be like,
hmm,

1497
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.910
I think I'm imbalanced and I have a mental health issue.
Right.

1498
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:57.390
You have to go cease.
And then someone's like,
Hey I can,

1499
01:22:57.391 --> 01:23:00.300
like once he sat down with someone,
it was two seconds,
they're like,

1500
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.860
you were bipolar,
right?

1501
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:05.230
Like then they started doing the blood tests and they started testing to what

1502
01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:06.064
would work and

1503
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.170
<v 0>now he's super successful.</v>

1504
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:12.520
He's balanced and he's taking his lithium and certain drugs can literally stop

1505
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:16.150
that.
They can nip that in the bud if you get it right,
if you get it right,

1506
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:17.260
but you have to be very careful.

1507
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:20.830
One thing he was very good at is he didn't want to stay on antidepressants,

1508
01:23:20.831 --> 01:23:23.080
right?
So the lithium balances him,

1509
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:26.590
but then they originally they wanted to get him so he like his arm looked like a

1510
01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.580
heroin addict for a while.

1511
01:23:27.581 --> 01:23:31.120
He was getting all these different tests and see what what because uh,

1512
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.740
like care Santa Maria broke this down too.

1513
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.620
There's very different like inhibitors and neuro Hibita is when it comes to

1514
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:38.830
antidepressants,
right?
He wanted to wean off of that.

1515
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:40.240
So what a lot of them encourage,

1516
01:23:40.241 --> 01:23:43.990
which comes back to kind of where we're saying like diet,
exercise.

1517
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:46.180
A lot of these things weigh into mental health,
right?

1518
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.090
You can't just throw it on the drug,
right?
Like,
Oh,
you're an addict.

1519
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:53.170
Like so he's very big on,
he runs marathons,
he exercised like,

1520
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:56.560
and that really helps,
you know,
the natural endorphins and stuff that he needs.

1521
01:23:56.561 --> 01:23:59.680
So he doesn't have to be on antidepressants ready.
Works out crazy.

1522
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:02.980
He doesn't drink alcohol because that's a depressant.
And that can cause thing.

1523
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:06.310
So even if it's a business meeting or something,
he'll try to be very,

1524
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:08.740
maybe you know,
he'll have a social beer or something,

1525
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:13.180
but he tries not to drink too much because he says he's told me that he's like,

1526
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.880
if he does for a few business,
he's like,
I can feel it the next day.

1527
01:24:15.881 --> 01:24:18.370
I can feel I'm a little off.
I'm a little cloudy.
Right.

1528
01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:21.550
Like my cognitive functions a little slower.
Right.
So he's like,

1529
01:24:21.551 --> 01:24:23.440
I tried just to stay away from for me,

1530
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:26.020
cause I know that can be problematic when he got,

1531
01:24:26.021 --> 01:24:29.890
it sounds like he got very lucky that the very loud with medication that can

1532
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:30.580
treat him.

1533
01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:35.580
I know a dude who was always a little off and then over the last four or five

1534
01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:39.370
years has become just a complete paranoid.

1535
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.860
I mean I want to say paranoid schizophrenia,
I don't know.

1536
01:24:41.861 --> 01:24:45.340
But I mean he literally believes that everything is a conspiracy.

1537
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:50.370
Everything in the world is tied to mind control tests and you know,

1538
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:54.280
it's,
it's sad to see,
you know,
I'm,
it's just one of those things like,
you know,

1539
01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:58.300
you,
you run into people like that and you just go,
man,
that could be me.

1540
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.640
Like I could be trapped in that hell too.
And I'm super proud of my,

1541
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.860
because like you said,
he's one of the only guys I know that is really like,

1542
01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.950
he's awesome now.
He's really made his life successful.

1543
01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:11.230
Like a Lotta when he was diagnosed,

1544
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:15.370
he started sending us like stuff to understand bipolar where it's like 85% of

1545
01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:19.750
them die.
It's not a good,
but like either,
um,
you know,
abuse of substances,

1546
01:25:19.751 --> 01:25:22.600
car accidents because things become a video game,
right?

1547
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:25.540
Like he talks about it now,
joking about like,
he's like,
man,

1548
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:28.240
when I was in my crazy days,
like I used to ride my,

1549
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.720
my dad's motorcycle going 80 kilometers an hour,
having a cigarette,

1550
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:34.380
like on the highway,
right?
Like he's like,
I was crazy.
Like,

1551
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.570
it's like I didn't smoke before,
but all of a sudden now I'm smoking and like,

1552
01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:42.130
like he was just like,
I was out of my mind spending money sporadically.
And,

1553
01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.340
but the crazy part that I was really trying to hone in as he,

1554
01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:49.360
you don't wake up and know,
right.
You don't.
No one tells you.
Right.

1555
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:53.050
Like luckily enough,
he had a great strong family and people that were like,

1556
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:55.990
let's talk to someone,
right?
Cause you're not the same.

1557
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:59.560
Like within three month period you're fighting with everyone,

1558
01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:02.110
your friends and your emotions are like you're crying one minute.

1559
01:26:02.111 --> 01:26:04.300
Then you're mad.
And,
and

1560
01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.400
<v 2>luckily like,
you know,
not a lot of them have a high percentage,</v>

1561
01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:09.500
but he's doing extremely well.

1562
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:12.260
Who mental health issues have such a stigma in this country.

1563
01:26:12.261 --> 01:26:14.830
People don't want to admit they have mental health issues there.

1564
01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:19.250
They're connected.
The PR perception by a lot of people's connected to weakness.

1565
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:21.760
Let you know,
depression is a big one.

1566
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:24.780
Couldn't get a job for the longest time because he'd be honest about it.

1567
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.630
Then people didn't want to hire him.
And I was like,
dude,

1568
01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:29.630
that should almost be like,
like once he's like,
listen,
I'm balanced,

1569
01:26:29.631 --> 01:26:32.000
I'm treated like they were like,
no,
we can't take that risk.

1570
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:34.460
Like he was looking at like a layman.
Can you blame them?

1571
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:36.710
I mean you don't know whether or not their balance,

1572
01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:40.280
you don't know whether or not it's going to keep working.

1573
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:44.000
Like whatever medication they're on.
And I kind of get it on both sides.

1574
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.810
I certainly think that for a person searching for a job that has mental health

1575
01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:48.201
issues,

1576
01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:52.220
it's a huge bummer that people can't respect the fact that you've taken all the

1577
01:26:52.221 --> 01:26:55.190
steps and gotten your treatment and now you're a healthy person.

1578
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:58.610
But if you're some guy who was running some office somewhere and you want to

1579
01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:00.710
keep the peace,
you want a friendly work environment,

1580
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:03.590
everyone to be family and get along together and you've got this dude who's on

1581
01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:06.980
15 different kinds of fucking pills to keep himself from running head on in the

1582
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:09.920
walls.
You know,
I could,
I can,
I can understand it,

1583
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.430
but I think that the mental health,
the stigma,

1584
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:15.770
especially to stigma on depression,

1585
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.800
I mean half a carat Santa Maria who's in the culture high,

1586
01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:21.050
it was a good friend of mine.
She heard her on here as well.

1587
01:27:21.051 --> 01:27:24.470
That's where your podcasting inspired a lot of it.
That's awesome.
Well,

1588
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:28.280
my podcast is inspired.
Me Too.
It's a call it my podcast,
but it would,

1589
01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:32.690
it really is,
is like,
it's a door that I found,
you know,
and I conduit.

1590
01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.000
It is,
it's a,
it's some sort of a strange antenna and a,

1591
01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:41.210
or a path or a channel in the river or whatever it is.

1592
01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:43.070
And I opened it up and I'm like,
oh,
look at this.

1593
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:47.060
And then all the people are coming through,
but it's not like people say,
Oh,

1594
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:49.350
you're doing a great service.
We'll have do it.

1595
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.250
Kind of doing a great service to me too.

1596
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.310
Like that's the number one benefactor is me.

1597
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:59.600
Because I get these conversations with all these fantastic people like Graham

1598
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.120
Hancock or Neil degrasse Tyson or you know,

1599
01:28:02.121 --> 01:28:04.520
Brian Cox and these like these brilliant,

1600
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:07.370
brilliant people and you have these fascinating conversations.

1601
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:09.530
And I get so much out of that.

1602
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:14.530
I mean I'm just constantly curious and constantly filled with all these new

1603
01:28:15.411 --> 01:28:19.250
ideas.
And it's amazing for me.
It's amazing.
So the same for me.

1604
01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:20.630
Like I listened religiously.

1605
01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:25.160
Like I don't listen when my kids were in the car because you can go off on

1606
01:28:25.161 --> 01:28:27.860
tangents at time.
Whereas I'll try it and they're like,
okay,
wait,

1607
01:28:27.861 --> 01:28:31.910
too many f bombs.
Why was my car the other day?
And I turned it on and uh,

1608
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:36.370
it was a,
the serious replay.
Cause you know,
we're on Sirius satellite,
uh,
and uh,

1609
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.570
it was my voice and the kids sat down.
I'm like,
get the fuck at it.

1610
01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.410
You fucking Moron Daddy.
Is that you?
Is that you daddy?

1611
01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:47.270
Like what?
Daddy doesn't talk like that?

1612
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:52.280
How dare you turn it into some sort of a joke,
but kids can't even go on.

1613
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:56.180
Like when I,
anytime I'm going on a long drive,
like if I don't have podcasts,

1614
01:28:56.181 --> 01:28:58.460
I'm not going like I can't listen to music anymore.
I need to,

1615
01:28:58.461 --> 01:29:02.760
and now I got hooked on Dan Carlin's hardcore history best,

1616
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:07.290
so good.
This new one,
this the one that he just put out,

1617
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.431
he's got this,

1618
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:13.200
this series out in part six just came out and it's blueprint for Armageddon.

1619
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:16.050
It's all about world war one.
He was just telling me,
he's like,
Adam,
he's like,

1620
01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:20.160
skip the Mongols.
Go to that one.
No,
don't skip the money.
The Mongols are still,

1621
01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.010
oh,
this is,
this is awesome.

1622
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.830
It is a blueprint for Armageddon is fucking awesome.

1623
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:29.610
But the Mongols is APIC.
I'm loving that.

1624
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:32.250
I can't believe you've crushed it to death on here,

1625
01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:36.180
but like how good those guys were riding horses and shooting fucking bows and

1626
01:29:36.181 --> 01:29:39.000
they were like,
I could see it.
Yeah.
You know,
there's a guy named,

1627
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:42.240
I think his name is Lars Anderson.
I don't know if you've heard of him before.

1628
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:45.840
There's this famous on the Internet over the last uh,

1629
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:50.841
year or so for developing these ancient archery techniques that were lost and he

1630
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:57.501
has like looked in like these ancient texts and photos of how there's one way of

1631
01:29:58.021 --> 01:30:03.021
holding bows and arrows that we have today and one way that he thinks that they

1632
01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:06.720
did back then where they held all the arrows in their hands instead of an a

1633
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:07.554
quiver.

1634
01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:11.880
They held them on their hands and they could literally rapid fire several hour

1635
01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:16.970
arrows in a second and he thinks that this might be one of the like loss

1636
01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:21.900
techniques that these ancient archers yous see this guy here,

1637
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:22.800
Lars Anderson.

1638
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.730
Like look how cool this guy can like shoot things that are in the air.

1639
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:31.620
Like you got to see how good this guy is at this,
how quick he looked.

1640
01:30:31.621 --> 01:30:35.910
He throws a tennis ball and as a tennis ball bounces in the air,
look at this.

1641
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:40.570
He could shoot it with fucking look good that he's shooting it with his leg is,

1642
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:45.230
he's got a bunch of amazing videos where he shows all the different things that

1643
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:48.480
could do.
Look with how quick he can shoot this.
He throws the air up in the air.

1644
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:51.510
I mean,
it's incredible.
No,
that's insane.

1645
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:55.220
He shoots things in the air before these coming down with them too.

1646
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:59.100
He shot two in like a second.
And that's the bow in his left hand.

1647
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.980
He can do the bone,
his righthand bone,
his left hand.

1648
01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.330
He can switch back and forth.
Either way.
I socket.
Yeah,
I mean,

1649
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:11.010
this guy must be links to his dick because he's just gonna say,

1650
01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:15.660
how many hours of practice is that too?
And he just shot an arrow.

1651
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:19.080
Look at this.
He's spinning this wheel and as the wheel spins,

1652
01:31:19.081 --> 01:31:21.060
he's shooting the arrows into the wheel.
Look at this.

1653
01:31:21.061 --> 01:31:25.500
He's kind of bounce off this thing.
He shot two hours before he hit the ground.

1654
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:29.760
Three arrows and a half a second.
This is incredible.

1655
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:34.620
I don't try this at home,
but I think,
um Oh fuck you.

1656
01:31:34.621 --> 01:31:36.920
Shit.
It wouldn't be.
It would be fucking amazing.

1657
01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:39.750
So what he's doing right now is just going to spin and shoot the Arrow in the

1658
01:31:39.751 --> 01:31:41.920
air.
And he dodged one there.
Will.

1659
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.190
He shoots the Arrow in the air as it's coming towards him.

1660
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:48.840
The guy shoots an Arrow and as it's coming at him,
Holy Shit.

1661
01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:53.640
But I think to see the Mongols and how they had done it must have been really,

1662
01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:57.630
it would be really amazing if someone was alive that had the kind of proficiency

1663
01:31:57.631 --> 01:32:00.190
that they had back then.
They would,
they would wait

1664
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.470
<v 1>until the horse was in mid.</v>

1665
01:32:02.471 --> 01:32:06.130
Gallup saw all four legs were off the ground before they release the air so that

1666
01:32:06.131 --> 01:32:09.220
it didn't shake like he was insane when he was explaining.
I'm like,

1667
01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:13.830
that doesn't even seem possible.
How could people I bleed?
They were just timing.

1668
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:13.991
I mean,

1669
01:32:13.991 --> 01:32:17.950
it seems totally possible if you could see that guy shoot three arrows and 0.6

1670
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:21.550
seconds.
Oh,
I bet.
I mean,
one of my buddies that plays football,

1671
01:32:21.551 --> 01:32:24.190
he was talking about how they learn how to run on a treadmill to be more like a

1672
01:32:24.191 --> 01:32:28.720
Gallup so that they don't waste energy.
So I mean,
you could see how you could I,

1673
01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:31.390
he was just explaining it to me.
I hadn't,
didn't get to see it.
And he's like,

1674
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:32.740
yeah,
we,
we learn how to,

1675
01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:35.440
so it's like you can do strides on the field so you don't burn out.
You're like,

1676
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:38.260
you can learn to kind of gallop until you have to really press right and get in

1677
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:42.540
there and so you can keep your momentum up.
Huh.
So it's like less,
you know,

1678
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.330
like me,
I'm very heavy footed.
If I run a trial,
I'm like calm pom pom pom.
Right.

1679
01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:48.310
But there's a way to be lighter,
kind of like,
you know,

1680
01:32:48.311 --> 01:32:51.560
sprinters are much more on their tippy toes for a part of it.
Right,
right.
Well,

1681
01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:55.090
they say that you're really supposed to run on the ball.
Your feet,

1682
01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:59.530
like this heel running that we've all gotten accustomed to is actually the

1683
01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:03.160
design of running shoes and the people creating these running shoes with these

1684
01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:06.940
really thick heel pads.
They've actually changed the gate of runners.
Jamie,
Jamie,

1685
01:33:06.941 --> 01:33:11.920
you're a runner,
right?
That's,
do you run with a,
those kind of,
uh,
running shoes?

1686
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:16.030
Uh,
yeah.
I actually use like the Nike free run.
They're actually really thin.

1687
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:19.270
Not as thin as like a converse,
but pretty close to that.

1688
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:22.800
It's almost like running barefoot just with the little rubber on your soul.

1689
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:27.770
So you run and land on the ball of your foot and you use that to cushion.
Yeah.

1690
01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.170
It's weird switch though.
Toes work is like a little bit of a spring for you.

1691
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.360
Yeah.
Your toes work as,
yeah,

1692
01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:39.361
it's like a shock absorber and if you run he'll like everybody is used to,

1693
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:44.350
I was like super bad for you.
You can just feel it when you get,
you know,

1694
01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:47.410
I've been recently trying to get back into shape is every time we go on road

1695
01:33:47.411 --> 01:33:49.060
trips for filming,
we eat like Shit,

1696
01:33:49.061 --> 01:33:51.320
we're late hours working and you get out of whack.
Right.

1697
01:33:51.321 --> 01:33:52.840
It's when I get home and I can feel it.

1698
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.000
The first couple of weeks I'm on the treadmill,
I'm heavy,

1699
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:59.320
I've kind of lost my rhythm and Clonk I can feel the extra weight and my joints.

1700
01:33:59.321 --> 01:34:02.280
But then once you get,
I kind of get back and I'm like,
okay,
now I,

1701
01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:06.220
it's weird a correct and I'm not anyone professional correcting me or looking

1702
01:34:06.221 --> 01:34:09.190
and seeing if I have the right shoe or whatever.
But I just noticed like,
okay,

1703
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.260
I'm starting to get my rhythm started,
pace of it better.

1704
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:13.720
I'm not so he'll mang as I'm running,

1705
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.510
well I run on the balls of my feet when I do it,

1706
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:19.480
but it always feels like I'm on a,
I'm falling forward or something.

1707
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:19.800
You know what I mean?

1708
01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.930
Like changes the way I'm not really feeling like a fallen for it,

1709
01:34:22.931 --> 01:34:25.780
but you know what I mean?
I've got like why doing this right way?
You know?

1710
01:34:25.781 --> 01:34:29.770
Like I feel like I'm doing something wrong when I run the real way you're

1711
01:34:29.771 --> 01:34:33.910
supposed to run well because your body's adapted and molded to the way that is.

1712
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:36.250
So then you just go and change it.
It's like,
well you know,

1713
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.000
similar to martial arts when you're like,
I'm a boxer stance rights.

1714
01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:43.340
If I was gonna go,
but that doesn't work for fighting MMA.
Right.

1715
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.760
My stance would be side.
It's much easier for a take down.

1716
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:48.380
I'd have to adapt and that'd be really awkward for me at first.
Right.

1717
01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.320
Cause is a consideration.

1718
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:55.120
Leg kicks is a huge one for boxing it up there.
You have to be more,

1719
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:58.220
more,
you have to stand sideways more or uh,
or uh,

1720
01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:02.060
<v 2>parallel more.
Yeah.
It's just one of those things where,
um,</v>

1721
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.590
I think like if you watch kids run you a,
you kind of get a sense like,

1722
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.180
oh this is just natural for them.

1723
01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:10.490
They run on the balls of their feet totally naturally.

1724
01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.800
And then we have through those weird shoes we've figured out a way to Kinda like

1725
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:20.570
come up with a new way and that way it's been adopted like across the board as

1726
01:35:20.571 --> 01:35:25.060
people.
Like they think it's the right way.
We'll look at you.

1727
01:35:25.061 --> 01:35:29.030
You have young kids and I have a boy that's three and he's always falling

1728
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:32.120
forward cause he's so tippy toe heavy when he runs right now.
Right?
Yeah.

1729
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:32.991
And when I go to his daycare,

1730
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:35.820
I see all the kids are doing like there's giant heads too.

1731
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:39.650
And that's like a little kid.

1732
01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:44.651
Like I have a four year old head is like almost as wide as his shoulders.

1733
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:46.940
He really think about how big their fucking heads are.

1734
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:49.900
Imagine if you had a head that went all the way out to the side,

1735
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:54.160
like one of those like,
like you are furry.
Yeah.

1736
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:59.390
One of the has a mascot head on.
Yeah.
They fall forward.
There's too much weight.

1737
01:35:59.391 --> 01:36:02.840
Their weights all out of whack now my boy bales all the time cause he's too,

1738
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.170
yeah that all the time.
But then gets right up and keeps going.
Yeah.

1739
01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:12.080
I think that uh,
whoever invented the running shoe with that padded heal,
it's,

1740
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:15.230
it's really kind of amazing how much of an impact that it's had.

1741
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:18.950
But it works when you're working your regular day job though and you're sitting

1742
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:22.520
on your heels all day.
Right.
That's still bad for you.
Even though shoes,

1743
01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:26.900
those shoes are bad to walk around in the guys who are back experts,

1744
01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:29.330
spinal correction people,

1745
01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.500
they say that the issue of like changing the way you stand,

1746
01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:37.880
like giving yourself an inclined,
like,
because of the fact you have heels on,

1747
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:41.930
like girls that wear high heels or dudes wear cowboy boots or shit like that.

1748
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:46.250
It's super bad for your back.
It's like giving your back this weird sort of,

1749
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.110
oh this is the,
that they had those,
um,

1750
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:56.010
that's like those barefoot technology shoes that people were wearing for awhile.

1751
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.220
I tried wearing those for awhile.
There were so ridiculous,

1752
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:01.130
you know why I stopped wearing them?
I couldn't wear them on stage.

1753
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.020
You know those,
what are they called?

1754
01:37:03.021 --> 01:37:07.450
Bt something bear for you weren't allowed to wear the ones?
No,
no,
no.
You rock.
Oh,

1755
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.330
numb.
They have like this,
uh,
they don't have the heel.

1756
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:14.620
They have like a big flat part.
Uh,
uh,

1757
01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:16.880
a big like thick part in the middle sort of.

1758
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:21.770
And the idea is this barefoot technology is like that.
You've got to kind of,

1759
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:23.210
you're constantly correcting,

1760
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.560
cause you're kind of stepping on his odd sponge and then it gives you,
like,

1761
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.310
you're,

1762
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:31.920
you're burning off more calories and you're using your balance more in the

1763
01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:34.010
stupid shoes.
This is the idea behind it.

1764
01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.570
But in that I'll get debunked that it doesn't actually,
well I think sketchers,

1765
01:37:37.571 --> 01:37:39.490
sketchers,
there's put that up again,
Jamie.

1766
01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.710
There's some sort of a giant class action lawsuit and the Oh,

1767
01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:47.150
consumer injury lawsuits.
I didn't know about this.
Is this new,
Oh,

1768
01:37:47.151 --> 01:37:50.350
this is new because there was a class action lawsuits and now there's,

1769
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:53.660
but is that for that shoe or does that for that toe shoe?
There's no,

1770
01:37:53.661 --> 01:37:57.030
this is a shoe with that rocker thing.
It looks ridiculous.

1771
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.060
I'd have troubles walking.
Well it's,
it's totally ridiculous,

1772
01:38:00.061 --> 01:38:04.740
but it's the same exact style of shoes.
It was barefoot running technology,
shoes,

1773
01:38:04.741 --> 01:38:08.880
whatever the fuck they're called.
Um,
but those,
these things,

1774
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:11.490
they're supposed to like,
you're supposed to be like constantly correcting,

1775
01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:14.880
almost like you're on a,
a,
a balanced bar or something like that.
Look at this.

1776
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.680
If you or a loved one suffered a broken hip,
broken ankle,
stress fracture,

1777
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.580
Achilles tendonitis,
uh,

1778
01:38:20.581 --> 01:38:25.200
that could be the result of wearing toning shoes like sketchers shape ups.

1779
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:28.110
We want to hear from you.
You may be eligible.

1780
01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:31.190
All the fucking the hounds are out back.

1781
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:34.980
You may be eligible to receive compensation for your medical bills,
lost wages,

1782
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.030
pain and suffering or other damages.
What other damages could there be new?

1783
01:38:40.031 --> 01:38:44.550
It couldn't get laid.
Man.
Stress.
We're stupid.

1784
01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:48.160
Fucking shoes ruined my confidence and prevented me from getting jobs.

1785
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:53.090
No girl would look at me.
I started taking mental health medication.
Yeah.

1786
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:53.933
Those um,

1787
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.990
those shoes were quite popular for awhile but I couldn't wear them on stage

1788
01:38:56.991 --> 01:39:01.170
cause you can't stand on your heels.
Like you're kind of rocking a little bit.

1789
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.900
Like if you try to sit back like you can't,

1790
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:06.360
like you can't like just cause you have this like,

1791
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:10.260
like Hump in the center of the shoe.
Okay.
It's really,
really stupid.

1792
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:15.420
I try to wear things as flat as possible with my,
my favorite shoes are chucks,

1793
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.870
converse,
all stars.
Those are my favorite because they're super simple.

1794
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.200
They're really flat.
There's no heel and those,

1795
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:26.250
they're the best for working out too cause you can like you push off the ground,

1796
01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:28.920
you forgot to chose.
Yeah.
Lifting them or barefoot.

1797
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:31.900
I like to lift barefoot but if I'm a home I lift barefoot.
Yeah.

1798
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:34.040
If I'm at a gym they make you worse than you have to wear shoes.

1799
01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:37.440
Cause cause that little thin layer is going to help you if you drop an 80 pound

1800
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:39.360
dumbbell on there.
Right.
That will save your toe?

1801
01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.200
I guess it probably help a little,
you know,
I remember,

1802
01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:45.030
I think it might help the cop because I don't think it will help the bone,

1803
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:47.810
but it might help you split it open.
I just,

1804
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.240
it's just strange that like this style of shoe like this is,

1805
01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.820
these aren't Chuck's,
but there's the same thing really.

1806
01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:57.360
Fin Soul that suppo flat.
No,

1807
01:39:57.361 --> 01:40:01.020
no fat cushion on the bottom.
Like those running shoes with the fact cushion.

1808
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:03.990
The heel supposed to be really bad for you I suppose,

1809
01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:08.220
but not like also a wallet in your back pocket.
It's supposed to be really bad.

1810
01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:11.930
I have a,
I can get Stan's a wall but I put it in my,
in my,

1811
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.640
I was wearing like a sports coat so I can put it in the side pocket.

1812
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.610
There are people gonna know to pickpocket you.
Adam's Gorgie.

1813
01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.780
They can't get it out.
They can't get it out.
I'll tell you,

1814
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:20.400
it'll get stuck if they try to.

1815
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.710
I switched to one of these recently and minimalist wallet.

1816
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.760
It's just a little tiny one that I put my front pocket credit cards.

1817
01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:30.570
I have a fanny pack still haven't give up on that way.

1818
01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:35.220
Never giving up.
Not giving that up.
It's the best thing.
I traveled too much.

1819
01:40:35.221 --> 01:40:36.480
It's the best thing for travel.

1820
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.420
I put it on everything is always right there in the front.

1821
01:40:39.421 --> 01:40:41.730
I have to reach in my pockets on airplanes and everything and then when I go

1822
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:46.170
through the Tsa I just click put that sucker in the basket.
Makes Sense,

1823
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:50.100
ethic click,
put it right back on and we're off.

1824
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:52.770
It does make sense when you break it down that way.

1825
01:40:52.771 --> 01:40:56.410
So I'm always thinking brother,
always thinking,
always breaking shit down.

1826
01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.370
I'd write it.
I just don't understand how the fanny pack got out of favor.
I just,

1827
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:05.050
I I refuse.
I refuse to accept it.
Never had one satchels.

1828
01:41:05.051 --> 01:41:07.600
People in their saturate.
It makes perfect.
Next your carry on for you.

1829
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.160
It's like an extra little bag,
right when you were thinking,
I was like,

1830
01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:12.994
actually I might have to,

1831
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:15.580
I haven't had to have to rock one of these for my product because I had my

1832
01:41:15.581 --> 01:41:20.020
passports and like my green card and everything and then you've got like for us

1833
01:41:20.021 --> 01:41:22.960
to cross with film gear,
we have to get like a,
they're called pocket letters,

1834
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:25.960
so that shows that it Canadian production is hiring Canadian workers.

1835
01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.750
We're not taking American jobs or just simply interviewing American subjects and

1836
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.070
so I have to have all that documentation and a car ne for equipment to show that

1837
01:41:33.071 --> 01:41:35.790
we're not selling at our equipment that we're bringing down and the whole works.

1838
01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:39.370
So it having that would actually be pretty handy where I could have like all my

1839
01:41:39.371 --> 01:41:42.280
stuff in there and just take it off.
You go through the,
the belt.

1840
01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.990
I had this one lady,

1841
01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:49.020
only one lady ever on a plane tell me that that was a bag and adapt bag.

1842
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:53.410
Had to either be put in another bag or tucked under my seat and I go,

1843
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:55.840
what are you talking about?
It's a pocket.
It's a pocket.
That's in the front.

1844
01:41:55.841 --> 01:41:59.380
It's just not attached to my pants.
She's like,
it's back,
sir.
I go,

1845
01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:01.990
it's a fanny pack,
fanny pack disconnect though.

1846
01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:03.580
She made me stuff it in my backpack.

1847
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.790
Are you really gonna make me take this off and put it in my backpack for takeoff

1848
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:10.510
and landing?
You have to take all back one lady.
I've been on a million flights.

1849
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.340
This has never happened.

1850
01:42:12.450 --> 01:42:15.160
It's so ridiculous to me when someone tries to get the gold star.

1851
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:16.440
When you go that you can travel a ton,

1852
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:20.710
like same airline and everything and then one day someone else is like,
yeah,

1853
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:24.520
I tried to target as always I'm filming so I just don't want any reason.

1854
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:27.100
Especially if I'm going,
if I'm going in Canada,
I'll argue a bit more,

1855
01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:29.410
but if I'm going to the United States,
we have a chance to not let me in.

1856
01:42:29.411 --> 01:42:31.870
I just go,
yeah,
no problem.
No problem.
No problem.

1857
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:36.440
I might want to go to Canada or anywhere in the world.
I'm just fuck yes sir.

1858
01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:38.170
No Sir.
Yep,
no problem.

1859
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:42.410
The other guy pulled me out of line last time I went to Canada.
It was,
well,

1860
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:46.440
it was on my way to do the UFC.
It was kind of interesting.
The guy,
um,

1861
01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:51.340
he w what is it called?
Not Pattern you,
uh,
what does it called?

1862
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:55.900
Oh,
randomly select.
Not Randomly selected.
What is it called when I'm like,

1863
01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.550
we'll do you target someone of Middle Eastern descent,
you know,

1864
01:43:00.551 --> 01:43:04.810
like what is that called?
Oh,
profile profile.
You,
Yep.
Yeah.
So I'm,

1865
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.700
the guy looked at me and he goes,
come here,
sir.
I talked to you for a second.

1866
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:12.820
And like,
out of nowhere there's a line of people are looking and everybody goes,

1867
01:43:12.821 --> 01:43:16.050
you're pretty big guy.
What do you do?
You know,
like,
like what do I do?
Like,

1868
01:43:16.051 --> 01:43:19.550
what are you talking about?
What do I do?
What did I do wrong?
And he goes,
uh,

1869
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.580
he goes,
what are you here for?
I go,

1870
01:43:21.581 --> 01:43:25.300
I worked for the ultimate fighting championship.
He goes,
oh,
what's up Joe?
Like,

1871
01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.240
and then he was killing it.
But I was like,
but if you wasn't cool with me,

1872
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:30.400
you know,
like he had decided,
he looked at me like,

1873
01:43:30.401 --> 01:43:32.580
what are you bringing in steroids or something?
And you lifting weights,

1874
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:36.420
you got any rocks in that fucking backpack?
Yeah,
like it was like,
it was like he,

1875
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:37.760
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know,

1876
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.620
I had all my paperwork and I had my passport and I had gone through and the

1877
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:43.510
guy's like,
come here sir.
I talked to you for a moment.

1878
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.580
Like he did not recognize me.
I had like,

1879
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:48.870
I had a vortex hat on and I'll like fucking just,

1880
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.980
I was just looked like a normal dude,
but for

1881
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.940
<v 0>whatever reason,</v>

1882
01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:56.360
I don't know if he decided like we're going to like target people look like they

1883
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:59.660
lift weights or people who look like they might be shady.
I got,

1884
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.170
I got flagged for awhile where I was pulled every time I went to Vancouver

1885
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:06.950
airport because one time I was leaving is weird.
My wife had gotten me new bag.

1886
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.390
It came with like,
she bought me some Cologne and then it came,

1887
01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.620
it was a Calvin Klein bag late,
just a duffel bag that came with the Cologne.

1888
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:14.240
So I packed my stuff.

1889
01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:16.790
It was like a two day trip to New York was when I was first doing the union.

1890
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:20.120
I was looking for Cruz and I was interviewing producers and stuff like that and

1891
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.170
it was just a quick trip.

1892
01:44:21.171 --> 01:44:25.250
But then I came back and then they pulled me aside and then they tested my bag

1893
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:29.090
and they're like,
your bag is tested positive for cocaine.
And I was like,
what?

1894
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.400
I was like,
bullshit.
I was like,
show it to me.
I was like,

1895
01:44:31.401 --> 01:44:33.230
I didn't know understand at the time.
And they're like,

1896
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:35.300
we found cocaine all over your bag.
I'm like,
bullshit.
Let me see it.

1897
01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:38.300
There's no cocaine in my bag.
And they said,
no,
no,
no.
What?
Like we tested it.

1898
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:41.780
There's particles.
Why would it be on there?
Do you do cocaine?
I'm like,

1899
01:44:41.781 --> 01:44:46.040
never in my life.
Not even tried.
It know like,
well how is it all over your bag?

1900
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:47.420
I'm like,
I have no idea.

1901
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:50.060
And then so we went in the back for hours and they're chill.
They're like,
Hey,

1902
01:44:50.061 --> 01:44:52.940
quit playing this game.
We talked to your friend.
I'm like,
good.
Well,

1903
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:55.160
he would have told you the same thing.
So I was traveling with a friend.

1904
01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.690
I was like,
he would have told you the same thing.
Good cop,
bad cop.
He's like,

1905
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:03.140
he told us the drill and I was like,
what?
Yeah,
that we went to New York,

1906
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:07.580
we're looking at developing a documentary and then it finally came down to where

1907
01:45:07.581 --> 01:45:09.830
I said,
okay,
like tell me how this particle thing works.

1908
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:12.950
Because I did the night deposit for my nightclub the night before.
Right.

1909
01:45:12.951 --> 01:45:16.340
And they say a large majority of money,
especially in nightclubs and stuff.

1910
01:45:16.341 --> 01:45:19.940
I asked cocaine on it,
right.
People do a rail wipe their hand grabbed the bill.

1911
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.090
And I had done the cash deposit for the nightclub right before our flight.

1912
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:26.420
I'd put it in that bag,
went to the night deposit,
put it in the bank,

1913
01:45:26.421 --> 01:45:28.970
and then I flew out to like six or seven in the morning and like pack my gear

1914
01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:33.490
instead of,
so I said,
could it be that like cocaine was on the money that was in,

1915
01:45:33.491 --> 01:45:37.010
in my bag that,
and they're like,
yes,
we can trace particles like that.

1916
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:39.830
And I'm like,
well then there's your answer.
But then they looked at my club,

1917
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:42.360
strip club,
cheetahs,
this and that.
And then there,

1918
01:45:42.361 --> 01:45:45.100
then it was just like we were in there longer and I was like,
oh.

1919
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.150
So every time I came back,

1920
01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:49.760
and here's the interesting thing is every time I came back to Vancouver,

1921
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:52.370
they flagged,
they'd pull me aside,
pulled me,
and finally I was so mad.

1922
01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:54.620
I was like one in the morning.
I was like,
please just don't pull me aside.

1923
01:45:54.621 --> 01:45:55.454
I'm so tired.

1924
01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.190
I got to drive to the outskirts of Vancouver to stay at my buddy's place.

1925
01:45:58.191 --> 01:46:01.790
I just want to go to bed.
It's a medic three and please go to the side.
I'm like,

1926
01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:04.880
so I was so mad.
I just laid on their metal counter.
I was tired.
Neck,

1927
01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:06.310
cause you know they do the thing where they put you over there.

1928
01:46:06.330 --> 01:46:09.680
Then nobody comes for like half hour,
just make you sit there.
So I just laid,

1929
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:11.930
I started napping.
It was exhausted like one 30 in the morning,

1930
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:15.290
coming back from New York.
I laid up there and the girl comes to get down.

1931
01:46:15.291 --> 01:46:16.790
I'm like,
I'm tired.
It's one 30 in the morning.

1932
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:20.540
I'm really tired and I'm not playing any games.
Like she and I finally just said,

1933
01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:23.090
why am I getting pulled over all the time?
I've never broken a law.

1934
01:46:23.091 --> 01:46:26.150
You can't like,
there's nothing every check your thing.
I've never done anything.

1935
01:46:26.151 --> 01:46:29.990
I've never brought over items that I shouldn't.
I have meet and she's like,
well,

1936
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.630
the big problem is,
is that one time your bag got tested.
I was like,

1937
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:35.420
I explained that and that should all be in the notes,
right?
She said,
yeah,

1938
01:46:35.421 --> 01:46:39.860
but we always don't trust it when you say you don't do the product right and

1939
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:42.920
it's all over your bag because then we think you're a smuggler.
She's like,

1940
01:46:42.921 --> 01:46:45.170
you're almost better to just say,
Yup,

1941
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.410
I did some cocaine with friends or whatever and we don't have any on me.

1942
01:46:48.411 --> 01:46:50.070
And I was like,
but I don't.
I don't do it.
I'm not

1943
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.810
<v 1>going to say I did it.
And she's like,
well,</v>

1944
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:53.550
that's why they think you're maybe a smuggler.

1945
01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:57.570
You're doing quick trips to New York.
It's on your bag.
Well,

1946
01:46:57.571 --> 01:47:01.820
it's like the guy who got in trouble for structuring the same,

1947
01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:04.170
you did it similar to what it is we're going to take.

1948
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:09.171
Your money was just cash that they have a bunch of different techniques that

1949
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:14.961
they teach these knuckleheads to try to like recognize shady people and so they

1950
01:47:15.091 --> 01:47:18.900
like think they're fucking spies are like think they're detectives staring at

1951
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:23.010
everybody.
I'm done.
I don't know about that.
Jamie Vernon and look at his face.
I,

1952
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:26.790
I saw a deceptive tips her and I immediately pulled out of the line.

1953
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:29.850
I actually got the guy really pissed off when it,
cause I used to get,

1954
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.550
these were the Canadian guys and I'm a Canadian so I was like you can't kick me

1955
01:47:32.551 --> 01:47:34.950
out of my own country.
So I battle with them a little bit harder.

1956
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.430
And the one guy asked me,
he's like,
have you ever done a narcotic?
And I was like,

1957
01:47:38.431 --> 01:47:40.500
no,
never done it.
Narcotic.
He's like,
if you never smoked weed,

1958
01:47:40.501 --> 01:47:43.500
I'm like that's not a narcotic.
Narcotic comes from the Latin word,

1959
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:45.510
meaning narcosis causing asleep and do state,

1960
01:47:45.511 --> 01:47:49.840
which is usually applied to opiates and heroin and stuff like that.
I was like,

1961
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.540
marijuana is a psycho tropical drawing.
I think he was just like,

1962
01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:56.070
it's like a trophy psycho tropic,
right?
That's tropical.
It's like a,

1963
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:58.920
it's part of the world.
And uh,
and he was just like,

1964
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.040
let's not get to the nitty gritty.
And I said,
no,
no,
no.
You're a border guard.

1965
01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.290
You're asking me questions.
I'm answering honestly.

1966
01:48:04.291 --> 01:48:06.600
So if you're going to ask me questions,
you make sure you answer the,

1967
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:09.210
you asked me the right one and I will give you the correct answer.

1968
01:48:09.211 --> 01:48:13.710
And he was like,
go.
You can go.

1969
01:48:13.890 --> 01:48:17.730
That's the difference.
You Canadians and Americans,
Americans there.
Fuck this guy.

1970
01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.580
Canadians are more willing to admit the feet.
Excuse me.
Sorry.

1971
01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.430
Yeah,
I just think that the whole border thing is fucking ridiculous.

1972
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.500
It's really ridiculous.
Well,
I'd had that debate with want them too.

1973
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:34.041
I'm like giving,

1974
01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:38.040
you guys know what your stopped like the big guys smuggle hundreds of tons,

1975
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.990
like through transport ships.
I've got one carry on.
How much you getting today?

1976
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:46.590
Know how few of those transport boxes ever get checked off when you look at

1977
01:48:46.591 --> 01:48:51.210
those gigantic freighter ships and they're just covered in those boxes.

1978
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:54.750
The vast majority of those boxes never get search.

1979
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:58.110
We'll look at Howard marks from our film,
the cannabis smuggler from the UK.

1980
01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:00.990
He was a great,
by the way,
genius way to put it in there.
But he's like,

1981
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:04.560
I made deals with the road manager of Pink Floyd Genesis cause he's like,

1982
01:49:04.561 --> 01:49:07.590
of course,
even if they did the testing back then they're like,
it's a band.

1983
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:08.860
Of course there's weed and stuff like that.

1984
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.410
And he put it all in there and smuggled it across.
Yeah.
Hash right side.

1985
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:18.150
Those speakers and the all the,
the reason school allege equipment.
Yeah.

1986
01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:20.940
Where's that guy now?
Where does he live?
Actually on four.
He's still in the UK.

1987
01:49:20.941 --> 01:49:24.710
Can't really leave the UK I don't think.
But he just got diagnosed with uh,

1988
01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.070
an operable a colon cancer.
So he's taken a turn.
He's bald now,

1989
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:30.270
going through things going on,

1990
01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:34.650
kind of a last tour and there's a doc being done specifically just on him.

1991
01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:38.250
And his and his role.
But,
uh,
I mean,
a brilliant character.

1992
01:49:38.251 --> 01:49:41.310
I'd love watching the theater,
but he's laughing when he's on.
He's hilarious.

1993
01:49:41.311 --> 01:49:43.110
He's got great charisma.
Yeah.
Well,

1994
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:46.560
one of the things that I thought was really hilarious about him was he said that

1995
01:49:46.561 --> 01:49:48.080
if he could do it today,
he's like,

1996
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:52.990
<v 0>I crack it off.
He's like,
I mean,
I loved it.
Great.
Such a great,</v>

1997
01:49:52.991 --> 01:49:54.910
honest answer.
And he's just like,
he's like,

1998
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:58.630
I suppose if I could get away with it,
I'd crack it up today.
And they loved it.

1999
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:03.580
Well,
it sounds like he was having a ball,
a ball.
He left it.
He was like a rocker,

2000
01:50:03.581 --> 01:50:06.150
like,
and he,
uh,
he,
he and then spend,

2001
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.860
the other part that's funny too is when he talks about the DEA and he's like,

2002
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:12.590
they say it was 50 tons,
but I know of course your transporter,

2003
01:50:12.591 --> 01:50:15.790
you know what you're getting and receiving.
It's like,
I know it was only 30 tons.

2004
01:50:15.791 --> 01:50:20.590
I know how much I was making off of that.
He's,
he was amazing.

2005
01:50:20.591 --> 01:50:22.490
He was an amazing part of that.
He,

2006
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:27.510
that's just so important to recognize how silly this whole war on drugs has been

2007
01:50:29.501 --> 01:50:34.501
and how ineffective this whole trucks has been and that these guys who were the

2008
01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:38.890
enemy or these charismatic,
really hilarious,

2009
01:50:38.891 --> 01:50:43.540
nice people that actually spent lots of time and effort to try to change the

2010
01:50:43.541 --> 01:50:45.940
laws that we asked them where like you were making a profit on it though.

2011
01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:48.700
It wasn't.
He's like,
ah,
I just feel that it'd be like a rocker.

2012
01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:52.810
I was only going to last so long and kind of just do it as long as I could until

2013
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:55.060
I went down.
Right.
What's next?

2014
01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:58.340
So you're going to do another documentary on we actually,
we've got not on weed,

2015
01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:05.620
Colorado,
we're done on weed.
I've got a two in the works right now.

2016
01:51:05.621 --> 01:51:09.610
We actually just got one approved,
but Robbie Knievel called chasing evil.
Oh Wow.

2017
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.910
That we're looking on all about how he was chasing his father's legacy and then

2018
01:51:12.911 --> 01:51:14.020
ultimately surpassed it.

2019
01:51:14.021 --> 01:51:19.021
And then his own father like actually was like threatened by his son rivaling

2020
01:51:19.031 --> 01:51:21.860
his thing.
So it became,
comes pretty dark.
Um,

2021
01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:24.610
and then also another one that I've been working on for years to get the

2022
01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:25.331
financing together.

2023
01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:30.100
It's a ice guardians all about the role of NHL enforcers in the history of

2024
01:51:30.101 --> 01:51:32.950
fighting and hockey and how now it's being weaned out of the game where it

2025
01:51:32.951 --> 01:51:34.870
started,
why it evolved over the years.

2026
01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:39.700
It's called the pussification of the world.
Adam's fluoridation of America.
Yeah.

2027
01:51:39.701 --> 01:51:42.530
Why are they taking fighting out of hockey?
How dare they,

2028
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:44.930
you take away finding on a hockey,
you know,

2029
01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:49.420
where you got figure skating with the top with a black ticktack.
Yeah.

2030
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.390
Well there's,
there's some very interesting uh,

2031
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:55.720
dynamics that plays into it cause such a fast game and you're on a foreign

2032
01:51:55.721 --> 01:51:59.890
surface with razor blades on your feet and sticks and you know,
a lot of the pro,

2033
01:51:59.891 --> 01:52:01.240
because we didn't just say interview tough guys.

2034
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:04.000
We're interviewing superstars and stuff too,
right?
That said like,
look,

2035
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:08.200
I played my best games when I knew there wasn't a chance that guy was going to

2036
01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:11.620
lift a stick and hit me in the eye or throwing elbows going to be concussion.

2037
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:14.290
He's like,
yeah,
he can get suspended or get a fine,

2038
01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:17.980
but nothing is more intimidating than when you have a six foot six killer that

2039
01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:20.860
he comes and leans over your shoulder and says if you play reckless like that

2040
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:25.350
again,
I'm calming.
Right?
So intimidation where it's a,

2041
01:52:25.351 --> 01:52:28.780
it's a fascinating dynamic that's been argued like kind of like the marijuana

2042
01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:31.240
thing where there's always the,
you know,
black and white,

2043
01:52:31.241 --> 01:52:34.510
but there's so many other nuances to it.
And for me the story,

2044
01:52:34.511 --> 01:52:38.500
I thought that's always been missed as these guys are amazing charismatic guys

2045
01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:42.880
that were so selfless,
willing to fight on ice,
bare knuckle,

2046
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:47.150
no weight class to make their dreams of playing in the NHL come true and protect

2047
01:52:47.151 --> 01:52:47.984
their teammates.

2048
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:51.740
That part has always been lost in the argument is how selfless they were.

2049
01:52:51.741 --> 01:52:53.120
And you want to talk about humility.

2050
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:56.300
I kind of compare it to what you and Eddie Bravo of talking about Jujitsu where

2051
01:52:56.301 --> 01:52:58.050
it's like the Douche bag eliminator,
right?

2052
01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:01.370
Like someone comes in on the biggest baddest and you get like the 16 year old to

2053
01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.160
Pretzel m three times.
Well with the enforcers,

2054
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:06.890
they've all been where they've been knocked out or they've lost a fight or

2055
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:10.250
something.
So they're humble.
His Shit,
they don't know any given day.

2056
01:53:10.251 --> 01:53:14.000
Their career can end.
They get sent to the minors.
They does happen to those guys.

2057
01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:16.150
They get beat up real bad too.
And they're never the same,

2058
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.550
never the same mentally or they get knocked out and then they have kids.

2059
01:53:19.570 --> 01:53:22.970
So the humility of them there,
some of the greatest athletes I've met,

2060
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:24.950
like getting to work with these guys.
Perfect example.

2061
01:53:24.951 --> 01:53:28.180
We interviewed a guy that won a Stanley Cup with the kings.
Um,

2062
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.840
he was a Princeton graduate.

2063
01:53:29.841 --> 01:53:34.280
Kevin Westgarth graduated with a degree in psychology,
super intellectual guy.

2064
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:36.950
And in college they don't allow the fighting,
right?

2065
01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.840
They don't have fighting and they were full cages,
uh,

2066
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:42.080
instead of open visor or open mass.

2067
01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:46.010
So he got drafted to the NHL to play for the kings and they wanted that physical

2068
01:53:46.011 --> 01:53:47.000
presence that he bought.

2069
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:51.500
He brought and he got knocked out in a game and uh,

2070
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:54.500
against,
uh,
it was like two years ago in Calgary and we asked them like,

2071
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.740
what was the first thing that went through your head like when you woke up and

2072
01:53:57.741 --> 01:54:00.110
realized like you're in front of 16,000 people,

2073
01:54:00.111 --> 01:54:02.020
hundreds of thousands of people on hockey night in Canada.

2074
01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:05.450
I've been watching and this part almost brought us all to tears when he was
like,

2075
01:54:05.451 --> 01:54:09.050
well,
once I realized where I was and what happened,
I was like,
shit,
he got me.

2076
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:12.620
He's like,
and then the next thing I realized is like,
wow,
I let my team down.

2077
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:15.980
I was like,
so injury knocked out everything.

2078
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:18.660
The first thing you're thinking about is that you let your team down.

2079
01:54:18.661 --> 01:54:20.610
And he's like,
yeah,
he's like,
I really,
you know,

2080
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.030
I'm supposed to be the guy there that they depend on.

2081
01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:26.420
That's the backbone to give them,
you know,
strength and everything else.

2082
01:54:26.421 --> 01:54:30.050
And I had let my team down and several of these guys had said that and that

2083
01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:33.500
selflessness that they're willing to give to their team to help them win.

2084
01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:36.260
That to me is so much more,
you know,

2085
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:38.000
when you're going through the journey of a documentary,

2086
01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:41.750
so much more compelling than just a statistical arguments and stuff like that.

2087
01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:42.630
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:54:42.630 --> 01:54:47.630
I always wonder like when you see violence in Nho or football or I wonder how

2089
01:54:48.221 --> 01:54:51.070
much longer that's going to be a part of society.

2090
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:52.303
<v 0>It's interesting.</v>

2091
01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:57.260
It's very interesting how like it's but I,

2092
01:54:57.350 --> 01:55:00.990
but then you have seized,
never been more popular.
Right.
Um,

2093
01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:05.910
<v 2>there's arguments that it's,
it's oversaturated.
Um,
I disagree.</v>

2094
01:55:05.911 --> 01:55:07.140
I think it's just,
I think there,

2095
01:55:07.141 --> 01:55:12.000
what there is is there's ebbs and flows and it's depending upon a bunch of

2096
01:55:12.001 --> 01:55:16.710
factors.
Dominant Champions,
champions get dethroned.
There's new guys coming up.

2097
01:55:16.711 --> 01:55:19.320
They,
but they don't have the same like Chris Weidman,

2098
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:23.160
although he beat Anderson Silva twice better than Anderson Silva.

2099
01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:25.380
Arguably it's especially today,

2100
01:55:25.650 --> 01:55:27.730
still doesn't have the name that Anderson Silva had.

2101
01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.100
George Saint Pierre sort of same thing.
Robbie Lawler,

2102
01:55:30.101 --> 01:55:33.570
who is currently the champ doesn't have the name that George had,
although,

2103
01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:37.230
you know,
he'd probably be favored if George and Robby fought today.

2104
01:55:37.290 --> 01:55:38.520
Robbie would probably be favorite.

2105
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:43.050
I think George is far more popular and that's just one of those things.

2106
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.093
Brock Lesnar.

2107
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:44.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2108
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.270
Cain Velasquez does not have the popularity that Brock Lesnar had obviously in a

2109
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:50.640
different reason because for different reasons,

2110
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:55.520
because he was the WWE champ and big pro wrestling is very loud and spoken and

2111
01:55:55.530 --> 01:55:57.570
like he was almost a perfect villain.
Right.

2112
01:55:57.571 --> 01:56:01.470
You wanted to see him lose because of his,
some of his antics and the way I like,

2113
01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:04.730
I'm a ridiculous fan.
I watch all the time.
So yeah,
me too.

2114
01:56:06.150 --> 01:56:08.280
I get what you're saying.
Like GSP in Canada.

2115
01:56:08.281 --> 01:56:11.100
I mean you're talking about like God,
they're right.
Yeah.

2116
01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:13.470
But not even just in Canada,
all throughout the world.

2117
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:17.040
I mean he has so many characteristics,
so many character traits.

2118
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:21.960
Just he was an honorable martial artist who is a great fighter.

2119
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:26.940
Yeah,
that's,
that's what he is.
And a well spoken guy and just so classy,

2120
01:56:26.941 --> 01:56:30.660
like everything about him.
He's just a,
he's a brilliant person.
Well,

2121
01:56:30.661 --> 01:56:33.270
and that's why I think some of the other fighters may not have,
is that,

2122
01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:36.480
I mean you had the full package with GSP,
right?
Like physically,

2123
01:56:36.481 --> 01:56:39.480
he looked astonishing too.
Right?
Like if you were to look,
you're like,
oh wow,

2124
01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:43.470
I can see,
oh he's a champion.
Like he's ripped.
He's this very polite.

2125
01:56:43.471 --> 01:56:46.770
Always like after a fight I want to give my guy at credit.

2126
01:56:46.771 --> 01:56:49.830
I know he'll be back stronger and more competitive next time.

2127
01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.670
Like that's much more marketable.
Other guys,
you know,

2128
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:57.990
don't have like Cain Velasquez I love and I think he's a destroyer but he's much

2129
01:56:57.991 --> 01:57:00.150
more monotone.
Like he doesn't have,

2130
01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:03.450
I think that would have been fine if he didn't get injured so much.

2131
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.500
I think what's held came back is he's only fought a few times over the last four

2132
01:57:07.501 --> 01:57:12.270
years.
He just keeps getting injured.
Shoulder surgery,
knee surgery.

2133
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.010
I mean he's had one after the other.
He's had several knee injuries,

2134
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.960
stroke,
two separate shoulder operations on both shoulders.

2135
01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.020
I mean his mental toughness and his drive is,
and the,

2136
01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.040
the training routine that those guys go through is just so unfucking believably

2137
01:57:32.071 --> 01:57:34.990
brutal that his body just can't keep up.
That's I was going to take,

2138
01:57:34.991 --> 01:57:37.500
cause he puts a pace for a heavyweight that you just can't,

2139
01:57:37.530 --> 01:57:41.040
I mean lightweights can't put the pace that he puts on.
Like he really does.

2140
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.480
I get exhausted watching him.

2141
01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:45.960
He out conditions guys when they like guys who train at Aka,

2142
01:57:45.961 --> 01:57:49.290
you'll talk about he all conditions Walter weights and they can't believe it.

2143
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:52.110
He all conditioned some of the 155 pounders.
It's crazy.

2144
01:57:52.111 --> 01:57:55.980
I mean he's moving around a hundred more pounds and somehow or another he can

2145
01:57:55.981 --> 01:58:00.180
keep up with them and surpass them.
He's a freak.
But I think the,

2146
01:58:00.181 --> 01:58:04.560
the injuries is what has held him back from being insanely popular because he's

2147
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:07.260
huge in the Mexican community.
Yeah.
He's gonna fight in Mexico.

2148
01:58:07.261 --> 01:58:09.800
They're fighting for breezy ober doom.
That's what I was fight.

2149
01:58:09.801 --> 01:58:13.260
It's going to raid fight in June and uh,
I can't wait to see that fight.

2150
01:58:13.261 --> 01:58:14.730
And that's going to be in Mexico City,

2151
01:58:14.731 --> 01:58:16.710
which is going to be really crazy cause they're fighting that.

2152
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:22.010
I think it's 7,000 feet above sea level who very high altitude a Mexico City is

2153
01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:26.430
no joke when it comes to altitude,
like you really feel it.
Well,

2154
01:58:26.431 --> 01:58:30.690
I know even we go to park city.
My family as I was in Park City in Utah,

2155
01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:32.640
the elevation up there,
my dad,

2156
01:58:32.641 --> 01:58:34.960
I thought my dad was having a heart attack the first time we went skiing.

2157
01:58:34.961 --> 01:58:37.530
He fell off.
The first round was panting.
He was like,
Oh my God,
are you okay?

2158
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:40.320
And he says,
Oh,
I think the elevate,
like I'm having troubles breathing.

2159
01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:43.270
And then after a few runs we kind of got a little bit adjusted.

2160
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:45.400
But it was interesting to see.
I was like,
wow,

2161
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:48.340
I can't imagine in fighting like that.
Just going down skiing like yes,

2162
01:58:48.341 --> 01:58:52.540
it's physical,
but not like,
not like competing in in any kind of fight game.

2163
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:54.910
Did you ever see Mark Hunt versus Ben Rothwell?

2164
01:58:55.740 --> 01:59:00.040
There was a fight that took place in Denver.
Yes.
Yes I did.
Yes.
Dulles is guys.

2165
01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:01.570
We're so tired,
so tired.

2166
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:04.730
They were just like swinging from their shoulder joints by the [inaudible].

2167
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:09.220
I mean it was all will and heart and after a certain point in time,

2168
01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:10.570
there's just no energy left.

2169
01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:15.760
And we've never had like a real long heavyweight fight at high altitude other

2170
01:59:15.761 --> 01:59:17.290
than that fight.
I think this,

2171
01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:21.820
this last one between Fabrizio for doom and Mark Hunt ended in the second round

2172
01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:23.740
for resale,
caught him with a knee.

2173
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:28.330
But like they get into like a junior dos Santos versus Cain Velasquez type
fight.

2174
01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.270
Those fights were fucking Burger UDL.

2175
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.660
I don't think it's ever been the same since then.
Um,

2176
01:59:34.661 --> 01:59:37.150
I don't think he hasn't either.
Seems to have effect,

2177
01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:39.090
didn't get really sick from like overtraining.

2178
01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:43.270
And one of them it was he fought in the second fight,

2179
01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:45.670
he had what they called Rhabdomyolysis,

2180
01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:51.100
which is what those crossfit people think I'm saying it right.
Yeah,
yeah.
That,
um,

2181
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.760
that comes from your body just overtrained to the point where your kidneys are

2182
01:59:54.761 --> 01:59:57.310
breaking down and failing and they're feeding on your own muscle.
Right.

2183
01:59:57.311 --> 02:00:00.700
As an awful,
yeah.
It's awful.
Deaths just,

2184
02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:04.060
it was just such an unbelievably brutal fight.

2185
02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:07.840
So I think it was that and it was also the fact,
the,

2186
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:12.870
the brutality of the fight itself and then also perhaps overtraining to prepare

2187
02:00:13.361 --> 02:00:16.630
for Keynes,
insane cardio,
you know,
because cane just,

2188
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:19.660
he brings it on a level that and a lot of it that they,

2189
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:21.610
according to the guys that train with them as genetic,

2190
02:00:21.611 --> 02:00:25.770
like he can just take three or four weeks off like get injured,
come back,

2191
02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:27.670
outwork everybody.
Well you can,

2192
02:00:27.730 --> 02:00:31.720
I compare and it might very limited boxing career but when you talk about,

2193
02:00:31.721 --> 02:00:34.090
I hear you talking about like you can't train power,
right?

2194
02:00:34.091 --> 02:00:36.750
Like that's something like there's genetic aspects and the way your body and

2195
02:00:36.751 --> 02:00:39.810
train a certain amount of power,
certain amount of power.
Yeah.
Like um,

2196
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.900
George Foreman type power when I either have or you don't,
when I box,

2197
02:00:43.901 --> 02:00:45.220
that was one thing.
I was very young.

2198
02:00:45.221 --> 02:00:49.780
I was 15 at one 35 but I mean at that weight I hit really hard,
right straight,

2199
02:00:49.781 --> 02:00:52.540
right hand.
It was really by the end of my sparring partners,

2200
02:00:52.541 --> 02:00:55.570
they'd only put me in with 25 year olds because they are worried that if I lost

2201
02:00:55.571 --> 02:00:58.300
my temper I might hurt the next of 15 year olds.
Right.

2202
02:00:58.301 --> 02:01:01.930
Like not trying to sound like a Herculean,
but just that was my,
you know,

2203
02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.310
for me that came instantly.

2204
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:05.960
The first time I started learning focus paths for me that was there.
It was,

2205
02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:07.900
the problem with that is,
um,
uh,

2206
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:12.700
with a lot of folks is that they rely on that and they don't develop the skills

2207
02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.350
like the guys like a Wayne McCullough or like a guy who doesn't necessarily have

2208
02:01:17.351 --> 02:01:20.890
brutal one punch knockout power.
Even Julio Cesar Chavez,

2209
02:01:20.891 --> 02:01:22.610
arguably one of the greatest of all time.

2210
02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:25.570
It didn't have that vicious one punch power,

2211
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.070
but he just would go at you with accumulation of perfectly placed punches.

2212
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:31.450
I would bet on that.

2213
02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:35.230
Anytime that like that better conditioning will cause it really like when we're

2214
02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:38.050
going back to the mental thing,
like especially if a power puncher,

2215
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:40.240
if you fight guy that just,
he's

2216
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:43.100
<v 0>not going down and he's got the Chin and you hit and like you said,</v>

2217
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:44.660
then you're overcoming,
you're like,
okay,
wow,

2218
02:01:44.661 --> 02:01:48.590
this guy might have to actually like outlast him condition wise and start being

2219
02:01:48.591 --> 02:01:48.771
late.

2220
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:52.280
Like then all of a sudden you already start second guessing yourself and you're

2221
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:56.870
losing.
You're like,
oh shit.
Like I saw it in the showtime Pettis,

2222
02:01:56.871 --> 02:01:59.810
the last fight when he got caught in the eye.
Right.

2223
02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.340
And he took it for who is the Brazilian that he fought his hospital dos Hondros

2224
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:06.170
I thought I saw it then I was like,
wow,

2225
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:09.530
he looks like he might be second guessing himself right now.
He's like,
holy,

2226
02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:14.210
I can't get space from this guy.
I can't,
I can't impose my will.

2227
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:17.780
And once that mind starts turning that you start second guessing like is my,

2228
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:22.520
I had it in the ring,
my loss where it was like,
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
God,
what?

2229
02:02:22.521 --> 02:02:24.950
Because I was living relying too much of my power.

2230
02:02:24.951 --> 02:02:27.690
Didn't train enough and then got beat.
Same

2231
02:02:27.690 --> 02:02:30.020
<v 2>thing with Jujitsu as well.
Um,
the WWE,</v>

2232
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:32.670
I always tell people if you really want to learn Jujitsu,
right?

2233
02:02:32.671 --> 02:02:37.320
Learn it from a small guy cause small guys rely on perfect technique.

2234
02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:38.483
Like,
um,

2235
02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:43.580
if you look at like the really big physically strong guys that are good at

2236
02:02:44.491 --> 02:02:45.090
Jujitsu,

2237
02:02:45.090 --> 02:02:49.600
there's a totally different style that they have in like say a Beret Yoshida or

2238
02:02:49.601 --> 02:02:52.440
a boiler Gracie or an Eddie Bravo or you know,

2239
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:57.470
there's a bunch of those guys that are smaller guys that have Leo Vieira perfect

2240
02:02:58.351 --> 02:03:02.520
technique and you need perfect technique when you're physically smaller person

2241
02:03:02.521 --> 02:03:03.780
because when you're in the gym,

2242
02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.670
if you go like you go to John Joc Machado's Jujitsu Academy or whatever,
you're,

2243
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:11.010
you're going to roll with a bunch of different people.

2244
02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:13.440
Like somebody might roll with you.
You're probably like,
what,

2245
02:03:13.441 --> 02:03:16.380
215 pounds or something like that to 10.
I've come down a little bit.

2246
02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.970
Or you might roll with Jamie who's probably like one 70 right?

2247
02:03:21.690 --> 02:03:24.960
What's that one 75 some of that.
What you've been in.

2248
02:03:24.961 --> 02:03:29.220
What I'm saying like there's,
and you know if you're a small person like no,

2249
02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.550
if I got,
if I weigh 150 pounds,
I'm not going to out muscle you.

2250
02:03:32.551 --> 02:03:34.980
I have to figure out a way to work around you.

2251
02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:38.850
I have to figure out a way to get your back or I have to figure out a way to use

2252
02:03:38.851 --> 02:03:41.580
technique only because I can't overpower you,

2253
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:46.790
but you can overpower a lot of people and big man Jujitsu is kind of Shitty

2254
02:03:47.130 --> 02:03:50.280
Jujitsu because big managers always trying to force their way into things.

2255
02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:54.660
A lot of wrestlers have that as well because wrestlers are used to fighting guys

2256
02:03:54.690 --> 02:03:56.550
in their weight class.
They used to,

2257
02:03:56.551 --> 02:03:59.850
or wrestling rather guys in their way class and they used to just go just

2258
02:03:59.851 --> 02:04:04.851
grinding and full power and speed and explosion and be a harder worker and all

2259
02:04:05.071 --> 02:04:08.480
that stuff.
Whereas with Jujitsu it's about moving around it and,

2260
02:04:08.481 --> 02:04:10.460
and it's all about the chess game.
Well,

2261
02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.080
it's just about understanding technique and positioning.

2262
02:04:13.081 --> 02:04:16.280
And if you learn from like a Guy Mendez or something like that,

2263
02:04:16.281 --> 02:04:20.310
the Mendez brothers are famous for being small guys who would just tap much

2264
02:04:20.311 --> 02:04:24.450
larger guys on a regular basis.
And it's just that pure technique.

2265
02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.790
Understanding the leverage,
understanding the positions.

2266
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.800
And you only get that from being smaller.

2267
02:04:28.930 --> 02:04:31.260
And I think if you look at a guy like Floyd Mayweather,

2268
02:04:31.410 --> 02:04:33.390
Floyd Mayweather has a bunch of knockouts in his career,

2269
02:04:33.391 --> 02:04:36.960
but he just does not have the kind of one punch knockout power.

2270
02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:40.530
A lot of other fighters do.
Even Combo knockout power.
He doesn't have it,

2271
02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:44.700
but he will also also,
he's so fucking smart.
Even when it comes to boxing,

2272
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:50.030
he's so fucking smart that he realizes the most important thing is don't get

2273
02:04:50.101 --> 02:04:52.140
hit.
That is the most important thing.

2274
02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.590
Well for your health and for scoring and for the whole work,
for everything.

2275
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:58.770
I mean what he does to people's shuts all their offense down.

2276
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:02.340
You just can't hit him.
He's moving.
He's popping you with the jam.

2277
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:04.280
He's popping in with the right hand.
He's clinching,

2278
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:08.340
he's getting the fuck out of the way and he's not going to stand toe to toe and

2279
02:05:08.341 --> 02:05:10.410
dig his heels in and try to swing with you.

2280
02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:14.940
Like some fighters would do like some fighters who would make things exciting,

2281
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:17.580
you know,
like a Micky ward or an Arturo Gotti.

2282
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:21.000
Like those two guys make it together and fucking go to war while it like Ray
Ray,

2283
02:05:21.001 --> 02:05:22.710
man CNE,
that was his style,
right.

2284
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:26.340
Is that he could out condition condition will you,

2285
02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:29.700
he array actually was really disappointed that they took away the championship

2286
02:05:29.701 --> 02:05:33.030
rounds like after his fight cause boxing made a ruling to try to,

2287
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:36.120
it wasn't just his fight,
it was a compound of a few other things,

2288
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:40.290
but they no longer had fights pass the 12 round.
Right.
And Ray,
he's like,

2289
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:44.190
I guess like he's saying the science doesn't show that you take any more damage

2290
02:05:44.191 --> 02:05:47.160
in those rounds.
And in the first rounds when a guy strong and crisp,
right?

2291
02:05:47.161 --> 02:05:51.020
Like you can still deliver the same amount.
And for ray he's like,
that was,

2292
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:52.230
those were my best rounds.

2293
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:55.650
Like when you would tire and you'd almost want to give up or you're Wilwood

2294
02:05:55.651 --> 02:05:56.341
brake a little bit.

2295
02:05:56.341 --> 02:06:00.570
He's like 12 like 13 1415 that's when I'm coming on strongest.
Right.

2296
02:06:00.571 --> 02:06:03.180
Let's see if you really have what it takes to be a champion.

2297
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.510
Would you see that with some guy like mighty mouse?
Demetrius Johnson,

2298
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:09.150
he's a perfect example of technique.

2299
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:13.770
Mighty mouse is the 125 pound UFC champion and a guy,
in my opinion,

2300
02:06:13.771 --> 02:06:17.610
who's the best overall pound for pound fighter ever.

2301
02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:20.070
That's why the light,
he's thinking that he's not like,

2302
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.750
I mean I'm a fan so I know who he,
but why do you think he's not as made?

2303
02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:26.580
Like not as known,
like in some ways 125 pounds.

2304
02:06:26.581 --> 02:06:30.090
Just the size that I'm five eight and when I interview him in the Octagon,

2305
02:06:30.091 --> 02:06:33.810
I looked like a giant,
you know,
he's a small guy.
It just,

2306
02:06:33.811 --> 02:06:35.490
there's just no getting around that.

2307
02:06:35.491 --> 02:06:39.720
It's just there's a reality of physics and you know,
people just,

2308
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:41.850
they want to see,
look,
in his last fight,

2309
02:06:41.851 --> 02:06:46.230
he finished the fight with one second to go in the fifth round of a fight.

2310
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:47.400
He was totally dominating.

2311
02:06:47.401 --> 02:06:51.210
He went for an arm bar and got it with one second to go against her Gucci.

2312
02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:56.040
Who's this bad ass mother fucker horror Gucci's a maniac,
you know,

2313
02:06:56.041 --> 02:07:00.360
he fights,
he's got this wild aggressive style.
Couldn't,
couldn't hit Demetrius.

2314
02:07:00.361 --> 02:07:03.030
He's just so good.
He's so slick.
And he's,

2315
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:05.760
he epitomizes the technique,

2316
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:11.270
the technique and knowledge and strategy angle of fighting everything he does,

2317
02:07:12.001 --> 02:07:13.770
his technique,
knowledge and strategy.

2318
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:18.690
He's not overpowering anybody or muscling or taking one to give one,

2319
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:22.590
none of that nonsense.
There's zero that nonsense going on.
So my opinion,

2320
02:07:22.591 --> 02:07:25.890
like when I look at like,
you know,
people say,
well Jon Jones is the best.

2321
02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:30.300
We'll certainly one of the best.
Like we got a tiny is there,
you know,

2322
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:31.740
but that's him making weight though.

2323
02:07:31.741 --> 02:07:35.440
He'll gain a little bit of weight after that too.
It's pretty octagon.

2324
02:07:35.441 --> 02:07:36.100
He's very sucked

2325
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.970
<v 1>in there,
which is also an unfortunate aspect of fighting.
Oh,</v>

2326
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:42.790
and also an interesting aspect like with duck who Kim,

2327
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:47.830
they started making way into the day before,
which they didn't during that fight.

2328
02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.490
And another interesting thing is that almost all the deaths that have happened

2329
02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:52.121
in boxing,

2330
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:56.680
a vast majority of like serious injuries came from guys who cut a significant

2331
02:07:56.681 --> 02:07:59.620
amount of weight.
And when you cut that weight,

2332
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:04.300
you put your brain at risk apparently because you dehydrate everything and it

2333
02:08:04.301 --> 02:08:09.301
takes a long time to rehydrate your brain fluid and spinal fluid and all that

2334
02:08:09.431 --> 02:08:12.520
stuff.
When you're,
when you're sucking yourself dry,
you're taking,

2335
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:16.570
you can't spit like people don't know what it's like.
It's hard.

2336
02:08:16.571 --> 02:08:17.610
It's a horrible idea.

2337
02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:21.010
For one of my body that was actually the fight I lost was when I really depleted

2338
02:08:21.011 --> 02:08:25.360
myself and was spitting in a cup and putting us a garbage bag over and skipping

2339
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:28.090
and running.
And wrestlers constantly do that.

2340
02:08:28.091 --> 02:08:30.070
I mean they brutalize their body doing that.

2341
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:34.270
And what's the difference to wrestling and fighting though of course is that

2342
02:08:34.271 --> 02:08:37.660
when you were wrestling re dehydrated,
you're not getting kicked in the head.

2343
02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.290
You know when you're kicked in the head might actually,

2344
02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:44.680
well I wouldn't think it's better but at least it'll be quick.

2345
02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:47.770
You know you get kicked in the head,
it's over quick.

2346
02:08:47.771 --> 02:08:50.140
Instead of taking a barrage of punishment.

2347
02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.560
You mean you see some fights where they go on for 10 rounds of just a beat down,

2348
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.861
Dum,
Dum,
Dum,

2349
02:08:56.861 --> 02:08:59.530
Dum and then finally the guy will collapse and the 10th round and you're like

2350
02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.510
how much can the brain take?

2351
02:09:01.511 --> 02:09:05.560
So how much and especially a brain that has already been significantly weakened

2352
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:09.010
by dehydrating.
I hate dehydration and fighting.

2353
02:09:09.011 --> 02:09:13.930
I think it's the number one problem with the UFC has other than,
you know,

2354
02:09:13.931 --> 02:09:18.160
some some issues with like different rules and knees on the ground as a few

2355
02:09:18.161 --> 02:09:18.700
other issues.

2356
02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:21.940
But I think the number one safety issue is dehydration and I don't know how to

2357
02:09:21.941 --> 02:09:25.570
stop it because people are always going to try to get that competitive edge.

2358
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.610
You would have to like get everyone together and say,

2359
02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:30.970
can we just make an agreement where we just fight at the weight that we are?

2360
02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:33.370
You know you're going to have when you want to fucking guy fucked that up.

2361
02:09:33.371 --> 02:09:35.760
Even if you did,
if a midriff 90% of the fighters are on,

2362
02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:40.540
you're going to have a few of those guys that no doubt.
No doubt.
I mean,

2363
02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:43.300
um,
what's interesting with the head check is ray,

2364
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:46.630
I talked like raising great shape.
How's he doing now?
Like mentally fine.

2365
02:09:46.631 --> 02:09:50.080
He had a cat scan.
He's like,
like he talks a little,
he talks a lot,

2366
02:09:50.081 --> 02:09:53.500
but his dad did the same thing where they just talk with their animated and

2367
02:09:53.501 --> 02:09:57.520
their hands.
His voice sounds a little,
it's a little slurry.

2368
02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.160
It times when he,
it's funny when you put them like,

2369
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:03.610
cause when we toured the film and you'd go to festivals and stuff and you get in

2370
02:10:03.611 --> 02:10:06.900
front,
he speaks immaculately.
Right?
It's excited.
Yeah.

2371
02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.300
But when you kind of just hanging out sometimes it kind of stutters a little
bit,

2372
02:10:10.301 --> 02:10:12.970
but give him a couple of beers.
He says that he's,

2373
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:17.230
he's had a scan and he said he's like,
no,
no bad scar tissue and stuff like that.

2374
02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:20.500
But he was credible.
He was very good at,
as soon as he ended his career though,

2375
02:10:20.501 --> 02:10:23.110
he didn't even spar.
Like,
cause I asked him like,
Oh,
do you still work out?

2376
02:10:23.111 --> 02:10:25.300
And he's like,
yeah,
I still hit the bag and run them.
Like,
do you can get,
no,
no,

2377
02:10:25.301 --> 02:10:29.290
no.
He's like,
I put all my wars when I competed.
As soon as I stopped.

2378
02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.310
No more sparring.

2379
02:10:30.311 --> 02:10:33.290
I don't care if it's a friend that wants to like done good for headshots were

2380
02:10:33.291 --> 02:10:34.124
over right.

2381
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.880
<v 2>We'll sugary Leonard is kind of the same way.
Sugar Ray Leonard.
Uh,
you know,</v>

2382
02:10:37.881 --> 02:10:41.180
you could tell there's a little loss there.

2383
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:44.120
There's a little struggle with sugar.

2384
02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:48.650
Ray Leonard has to talk about things.
They pretty well,
there's a little,

2385
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:52.130
there's a little hitch in his step as opposed to when he was younger.

2386
02:10:52.131 --> 02:10:53.450
But you know,

2387
02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:57.800
as far as the amount of fights that guy had championship fights against guys

2388
02:10:57.801 --> 02:11:02.330
like Tommy Hearns,
Marvin Hagler.
I mean Roberto Duran,

2389
02:11:02.331 --> 02:11:06.550
he fought some of the best of the best to get through that and be,
uh,
uh,

2390
02:11:06.551 --> 02:11:08.570
regularly functioning man in his fifties.

2391
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:12.080
Then there's also depression is a bunch of things that go along with head trauma

2392
02:11:12.081 --> 02:11:14.450
that we're starting to find out about that man.

2393
02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:18.740
If they could figure out a way to mitigate that or,
or,

2394
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:23.030
or fix it once it's become an issue because it's one of the few things at once

2395
02:11:23.031 --> 02:11:26.090
the function is compromised,
there's really not much they can do about it.

2396
02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:28.430
They can repair your shoulder,
you know.
Well he's saying,

2397
02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:31.550
cause you talk about Alpha brain a lot and wasn't the original guy that started

2398
02:11:31.551 --> 02:11:34.520
looking into new tropics,
like a football player that had a whole bunch of no,

2399
02:11:34.521 --> 02:11:35.960
he's definitely not the original guy.

2400
02:11:35.961 --> 02:11:38.960
Bill Romanowski but that's how I found out about it.

2401
02:11:38.961 --> 02:11:42.800
He has a great product that you could buy right now it's called neuro one and

2402
02:11:42.801 --> 02:11:47.780
neuro one.
Um,
I found out there was used to be the show in San Francisco,
um,
uh,

2403
02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.680
called,
uh,
Sarah,
no name on Alice.

2404
02:11:50.681 --> 02:11:53.630
There was a radio station called Alice and I would do the radio station all the

2405
02:11:53.631 --> 02:11:56.610
time and no name was the,
one of the DJ's.

2406
02:11:57.950 --> 02:12:01.400
He was friends with Roman Romanowski would train them and take them to work out

2407
02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:02.234
with them and stuff.

2408
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:06.110
And Roman Ascii gave him this tub of this stuff that he had called neuro one to

2409
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:09.050
give him some like some sample packs to give away.
And I took it and I was like,

2410
02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:12.110
Whoa,
this stuff has got something in it,
man.
And he was like,

2411
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:15.110
it's for brain function.
I was like,
well,
what does it do?
And he goes,

2412
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:17.330
and then he explained it to me.
And then I,
there was,

2413
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:22.160
I don't even think there was Google at the time.
So that's like ancient.

2414
02:12:22.161 --> 02:12:23.750
We're talking about the olden days.
Oh yeah.

2415
02:12:23.751 --> 02:12:25.310
Well this is when I was doing morning radio.

2416
02:12:25.311 --> 02:12:28.130
I haven't done morning radio and along.
I occasionally do it,

2417
02:12:28.131 --> 02:12:29.810
but I used to do it for every Gig I did.

2418
02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.590
I'd have to do morning radio to promote the GIG.
So I,
um,

2419
02:12:33.710 --> 02:12:38.060
I go and start looking up,
uh,
do various things in nootropics.

2420
02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:42.590
And I found out about Paratha Tim and all of that was how we eventually got into

2421
02:12:42.591 --> 02:12:43.850
developing Alpha brain.

2422
02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:49.210
But neuro one Roman ASCII developed because he was having issues with his

2423
02:12:50.181 --> 02:12:54.680
cognitive function after a series of concussions.
I mean playing in the NFL,

2424
02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:58.550
who knows how many times that guy got concussed.
I mean it's just up in the air,

2425
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.530
but so he,
you know,
he took a proactive approach to dealing with it and um,

2426
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:07.400
built up this line of products and what does it,

2427
02:13:07.401 --> 02:13:10.850
they get like an Alpha brain in that one.
Are there any benefits?
Kind of like a,

2428
02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:13.880
like just a vitamin if you take it on a regular basis for people that have had

2429
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:15.710
head trauma can make things like,

2430
02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:18.080
I know it's not area Miracle Hill that's going to correct it,

2431
02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:20.780
but I wouldn't even want to speculate quite honestly.
I mean,

2432
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:24.560
I take it all the time,
but I take it from memory.
I take it for Brett.

2433
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:28.400
Brett like raves about it when he was writing the culture high,

2434
02:13:28.401 --> 02:13:31.100
like that was part of that.
He's like,
Adam,
you need to get me out for brain.

2435
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.310
I'm writing like he

2436
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:35.640
<v 0>for him,
that's his thing.
He's like,
when I'm writing and being creative,</v>

2437
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.290
he wants Elf brand.

2438
02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:40.630
<v 2>Turn it us a dummy into a smart personnel.
But what it,</v>

2439
02:13:40.631 --> 02:13:45.520
what it will do is it gives you,
you know,
human neuro transmitters,

2440
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:47.350
this is obviously coming from a,

2441
02:13:47.351 --> 02:13:52.351
an untrained on educated monkey when you hear me talk,

2442
02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.430
but human neurotransmitter's essentially everything that your body has,
right?

2443
02:13:57.490 --> 02:14:02.260
And your body is developed based on the building blocks that you put into it.

2444
02:14:02.290 --> 02:14:05.560
Nutritional building blocks.
I mean,
that's the only thing your body takes in.

2445
02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.180
Other than that,
it can't,

2446
02:14:07.181 --> 02:14:10.630
you literally can't replicate all the cells in your body without food and

2447
02:14:10.631 --> 02:14:13.870
nutrition.
I mean,
that's,
that's literally what it's there for.
And it,

2448
02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:18.670
the more healthy precursors for neuro transmitters are more healthy foods.

2449
02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.290
The more healthy nutrients you take into your body,

2450
02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:25.420
the better your body functions,
period.

2451
02:14:25.421 --> 02:14:29.560
And they've isolated a bunch of different nutrients that can help your brain

2452
02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:33.280
function better.
And it is not just the stuff that's an Alpha brain.

2453
02:14:33.281 --> 02:14:35.620
If you just Google new tropics,
you know,

2454
02:14:35.621 --> 02:14:39.790
and I try to be as even about this as possible because even though I'm a part of

2455
02:14:39.791 --> 02:14:41.380
on it and I sell it,
I want,

2456
02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:46.210
I want everybody to understand like this isn't Voodoo.
It's not snake oil.

2457
02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:47.193
It's not the,

2458
02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.490
the Boston Center for memory that did the tests on Alpha brain is a very well

2459
02:14:51.491 --> 02:14:52.720
respected institution.

2460
02:14:52.721 --> 02:14:57.040
We brought them to separate double blind placebo controlled studies.

2461
02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:01.780
The one was a pilot study that was 20 people than other one was 63 people and

2462
02:15:01.781 --> 02:15:06.310
bolt of them showed improvements in memory improvements and executive function

2463
02:15:06.311 --> 02:15:09.730
improvements in reaction time.
And it's,
it's not Mumbo jumbo.

2464
02:15:09.731 --> 02:15:14.731
It's all based on what does your body need to produce human neurotransmitters.

2465
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:16.730
There's certain nutrients take those nutrients.

2466
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:19.870
Your body will produce human neuro transmitters more effective.

2467
02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:23.650
What is the benefit?
The benefit is you don't have to search for words as much.

2468
02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:24.720
You have a,

2469
02:15:24.730 --> 02:15:27.820
you'll have better cognitive function and you react to things quicker.

2470
02:15:27.821 --> 02:15:28.500
You'll have better react.

2471
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.330
<v 0>I mean,
it makes perfect sense.
I know.</v>

2472
02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:34.320
Just basically when we go on road trips and we're shooting and we're working

2473
02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.400
long hours and you're trying to get to interviews,

2474
02:15:35.401 --> 02:15:38.110
cause when you know you're doing interviews for docs,
they're free interview.

2475
02:15:38.111 --> 02:15:41.070
So it's on those persons time we set up and then we're trying to make
theatrical.

2476
02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:41.821
So you got to set up the light.

2477
02:15:41.821 --> 02:15:46.380
They're long days and we go eat leg shit and I'm crushing energy drinks and so I

2478
02:15:46.381 --> 02:15:48.570
feel it at the end of the week.
Like my body's like,

2479
02:15:48.571 --> 02:15:50.340
what are you doing to yourself?
Right?

2480
02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:52.920
Then when I get back and I start eating like,
you know,

2481
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:56.070
good fishes and vegetables and protein,
then I'm like,
oh,

2482
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:58.580
now I feel better and sleep.
Very few

2483
02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:02.330
<v 2>things as important as sleep.
I mean you,
you need all those nutrients,</v>

2484
02:16:02.331 --> 02:16:05.180
but if you take all those nutrients and you're not giving your body a chance to

2485
02:16:05.181 --> 02:16:08.960
utilize them and recover and rest you,
you're not going to have the benefits.

2486
02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.590
There's a guy we had on Dr. Andrew Hill who has a product that I really liked

2487
02:16:12.591 --> 02:16:16.070
too,
called true brain and uh,
he gave us somewhere at the studio.

2488
02:16:16.071 --> 02:16:18.740
I like that as well.
It's a different formula than Alpha brain,

2489
02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:21.200
but there's a bunch of these different formulas.

2490
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:24.110
You could find a bunch of them online experiment,
try it out.

2491
02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:28.910
Well we tried to do with Alpha brain is make it as ethical as possible so like

2492
02:16:28.911 --> 02:16:33.520
if you take,
this is a 30 pill count.
If you take this,
you got 90 days.

2493
02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:36.700
If at 90 days you say this stuff is bullshit,
it's not doing anything.

2494
02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.390
You get a 100% of your money back.
You don't even have to return the package.

2495
02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:45.070
And the only reason why we did that is cause like what is the best way to ensure

2496
02:16:45.071 --> 02:16:48.760
that no one is going to complain about being ripped off.
But still people,
I was,

2497
02:16:48.770 --> 02:16:52.420
I was going to say people probably still found a way,
yo.
Yeah man.
People,

2498
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:55.780
people get angry but they're always going to be angry at everything you use.

2499
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:58.750
If you don't believe in nootropics,
don't buy him,
that's fine.

2500
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:02.650
But if you look Google it or if you just go to the Onnit website and read all

2501
02:17:02.651 --> 02:17:05.530
the research on Alpha brain,
read all the references.

2502
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:09.580
If you don't think that there's something in all that that didn't just walk away

2503
02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:11.290
from it,
but if you,

2504
02:17:11.291 --> 02:17:16.060
if you're interested like you know and peoples who it's not worth it.
It,
to me,

2505
02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:20.220
cognitive function is one of the most important things to me.
The weight,
the,

2506
02:17:20.290 --> 02:17:23.170
the quality of my thinking,
the way my brain works.

2507
02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:27.100
I've experienced DL thinking,
I've been disappointed in my thinking.

2508
02:17:27.101 --> 02:17:30.940
I've been disappointed in my process and I've also been like,
Ooh,

2509
02:17:30.941 --> 02:17:32.470
I'm on right now.
This is great.

2510
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:37.450
I'm getting things done and I try to steer towards anything that gets me to the

2511
02:17:37.451 --> 02:17:41.920
Amon and the nutrition is the biggest one for me.
Without a doubt.

2512
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:46.950
The biggest factor in how my brain functions is eating a lot of vegetables and

2513
02:17:47.081 --> 02:17:51.160
eating healthy foods and keeping away from shitty foods,
keeping away from sugar.

2514
02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.140
If I do all that,
I guarantee I feel,
I know I feel a difference.

2515
02:17:56.141 --> 02:17:59.080
I feel the difference the way my brain functions.
I'm the same way,

2516
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:02.620
but when we travel sometimes it gets tough and then easily,
so most hard.

2517
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:04.770
I need to start getting some of your nature box snacks.

2518
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:08.800
That's what I need to start hooking up.
Those are those,
which is free fruit too.

2519
02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:11.080
You know when you're on the road to go to a supermarket,

2520
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:15.430
you know if you're on the road supermarket,
you can go,
go to the fruit aisle,

2521
02:18:15.610 --> 02:18:20.230
get some apples,
get some oranges,
get some bananas and leave me Your Hotel Room.

2522
02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:23.410
You know that you're going to ensure that you're going to be taking in fresh

2523
02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:27.040
nutrients and it's just a little trip to the supermarket.
It's not that hard.

2524
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:31.750
A lot of times he'll start putting that into the line items and things to get

2525
02:18:31.751 --> 02:18:35.260
done.
You know what?
I get to men when I go to a,
I get Kombucha.

2526
02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:37.960
I don't have one right here.
Oh,
I know Kombucha.
Oh Dude.

2527
02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:40.840
This big for probiotics.

2528
02:18:40.841 --> 02:18:45.760
As far as like your immune system health,
it was like one of the best things.

2529
02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:48.400
I love it.
It makes a huge impact.
I very,
very,

2530
02:18:48.401 --> 02:18:51.820
very rarely get sick and I travel a lot.
I don't get sick lots.

2531
02:18:51.821 --> 02:18:54.040
I'm fortunate there.
Knock on wood.
I'm good with that,

2532
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:57.820
but I just feel I get run down and I put on weight and then I get it in my face

2533
02:18:57.821 --> 02:18:59.950
right away.
I'll see pictures when we're on the road.
I'm like,
fuck,

2534
02:18:59.951 --> 02:19:04.090
I was eating bad and like my face gets pudge,
Ese and brain inflammation too.

2535
02:19:04.091 --> 02:19:07.690
It sugar.
Well that's what you're crushing energy drinks and all that crap.

2536
02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:10.210
So those are acid in a can.

2537
02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:13.780
Like you can feel like when you burp him up and stuff,
you're like,
that is acid.

2538
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:16.510
I'm surprised it doesn't just eat through my stomach and leak out of my belly

2539
02:19:16.511 --> 02:19:20.230
button.
I'll tell you what though.
Red Bull is fucking delicious.
It is delicious.

2540
02:19:20.231 --> 02:19:24.040
I just assholes.
Red Bull to make it so yummy.

2541
02:19:24.470 --> 02:19:28.040
I'm with a taste.
I like the taste too.
It's cool.
I crushed

2542
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.480
<v 1>those on like when we go on the road,
we actually had a joke.</v>

2543
02:19:30.481 --> 02:19:32.270
We had our sound guy when we were filming the culture.

2544
02:19:32.271 --> 02:19:35.070
I came in our van and he's like,
why is your fence smell like red bull?

2545
02:19:35.071 --> 02:19:35.361
And we're like,

2546
02:19:35.361 --> 02:19:38.660
look at all the cans and the that we're crushing red bull and we're like,

2547
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:41.900
that's why it smells like red bull.
That's tough.
It's super bad for you though.

2548
02:19:41.901 --> 02:19:45.020
So bad.
Especially when you drink those big ones like gas station,

2549
02:19:45.021 --> 02:19:47.600
you don't want to ever go.
I've,
I've really been good at that.

2550
02:19:47.601 --> 02:19:50.840
That I don't ever drink more than two of the small sugar free.

2551
02:19:50.841 --> 02:19:54.230
That's the most I drank back in.
Then when we were working in the called,

2552
02:19:54.231 --> 02:19:58.060
there's days I drank like four or five like giving myself.
That's really scary.

2553
02:19:58.080 --> 02:19:59.250
Yeah.
Well the,

2554
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.840
there's a gas station and then I go to the sells them and they have the normal

2555
02:20:02.841 --> 02:20:03.674
size ones,

2556
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:08.600
but then they have these giant like what the fuck doesn't look like a heart

2557
02:20:08.601 --> 02:20:13.010
attack and it can to me I'm scared.
Do they say more than one portion on it?

2558
02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:16.520
When you read the giant ones,
does it say like three servings or something?

2559
02:20:16.521 --> 02:20:19.100
Sneaky.
I thought it said that on the small ones,

2560
02:20:19.101 --> 02:20:23.210
like do not drink more than one can per day and then now you have those giant

2561
02:20:23.211 --> 02:20:25.210
bullets.
When I'm like,
they just get,

2562
02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.910
if they give it to you and just write somewhere in the fine print,

2563
02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:31.900
there's four servings per can.
You know,
like they're good.
Yeah,
they're good kids.

2564
02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:35.630
They'll say like one serving is 200 milligrams of caffeine,

2565
02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:39.110
four servings per camp.
Wait a minute.
How Paul?
Hold on.

2566
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.300
How much do you drink before you dick explodes?

2567
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:44.930
How much do you drink before you fucking head oozes out of your ears?

2568
02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.050
I always wonder when I see someone that's really overweight and they're crushing

2569
02:20:48.051 --> 02:20:50.900
one of those giant,
I'm like,
man,
you're,
you're putting your heart at risk.

2570
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:52.690
I'd have to think like that.
Yeah.

2571
02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:55.370
I had a friend who used to carry one of those monster energy drinks with them.

2572
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:57.980
You literally never saw him without one of those things.

2573
02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:01.910
He was completely addicted to the Muse,
drinking them all day long and he went,

2574
02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.020
he went to a spin class and he went to spin class with my friend and he was

2575
02:21:06.021 --> 02:21:08.870
fucking dying and it's been like,
he literally had to get off the bike,

2576
02:21:08.871 --> 02:21:12.990
like his heart was pounding.
I'm like,
dude,
you're on speed speed.

2577
02:21:12.991 --> 02:21:16.580
You probably taking a thousand milligrams of caffeine in the last few hours.

2578
02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:19.700
We'll since there's been no regulate or there's some regular,

2579
02:21:19.701 --> 02:21:23.390
but you've been hearing about a young kids and stuff on sports teams having big

2580
02:21:23.391 --> 02:21:26.720
problems.
Right.
Or the five hour energies and stuff.
Right.
Killing people there.

2581
02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:30.790
Five hour energies kill people.
Well,
I thought that was luck,

2582
02:21:31.350 --> 02:21:33.830
but some people when they're studying or something like that,

2583
02:21:33.831 --> 02:21:35.380
they crush four or five,
right?

2584
02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:40.700
I'm pretty sure five hour energy drink is low caffeine and it's like vitamin B

2585
02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:44.510
12 and double check that Jamie Google and see if there is to make sure I'm not

2586
02:21:45.470 --> 02:21:46.281
speaking out of my ass,

2587
02:21:46.281 --> 02:21:48.740
but I thought I'd read some articles on that if people that,

2588
02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:52.250
you know they were looking at the cause of death and it was like really high

2589
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:53.960
caffeine levels or,

2590
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:57.910
or what's the like Grana seat or mal hung that's in a lot of those things were

2591
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:02.690
on a,
on a seed.
So yeah,
that's a natural form of caffeine,
right?
Isn't it?

2592
02:22:02.691 --> 02:22:03.890
Or a same sort of similar,

2593
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.880
it's like a mixture of them that they would put in because when a federal and

2594
02:22:07.881 --> 02:22:11.660
with like was taken out of a lot of them than the Phaedra.

2595
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:14.670
Did you ever have ripped fuel?
We'll try that.

2596
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:17.840
My good buddy of mine who's a big fan and he'd love a show up.

2597
02:22:17.841 --> 02:22:21.980
My buddy Jared was addicted to,
we joke about it like in the morning,

2598
02:22:21.981 --> 02:22:24.800
I'd hear him cause we roomed in New York and I'd hear the Chicka Chicka Chicka

2599
02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.050
of bottle and he would take the

2600
02:22:26.050 --> 02:22:29.640
<v 2>ephedra like a daily routine.
Okay,
so look at this.</v>

2601
02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:32.340
The extra has 230 milligrams of caffeine.

2602
02:22:32.341 --> 02:22:37.270
The regular one has 200 and deek.
What does DECAF,
the five

2603
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:42.330
year,
so how much does that compare it to?
A Cup of coffee?

2604
02:22:42.350 --> 02:22:47.350
I think 200 milligrams is a Starbucks large like a Venti Starbucks I think.

2605
02:22:48.301 --> 02:22:52.920
Right for Google that find that out.
But then what's the other stuff in it too?

2606
02:22:52.921 --> 02:22:53.191
Right?

2607
02:22:53.191 --> 02:22:58.191
Like is there like a mixture if you do a lot of the caffeine and a sodium

2608
02:22:58.261 --> 02:22:58.891
vitamin B,

2609
02:22:58.891 --> 02:23:03.891
12 large p 12 while we have that 8333% of the daily value.

2610
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:09.150
So 500 mcgs of a B 12 fold account.
What'd you do?

2611
02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.680
Oh that kind of shows a comparison there.
The Red Bulls and stuff like that.

2612
02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:19.140
Niacin,
which is healthy for you.
Energy blend.
Look at this though.

2613
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:23.580
What does that energy blend?
Where do you see that?
Right there at the bottom,

2614
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:24.271
taurine,

2615
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:29.271
which is funky with Heidi said that glue co glucuronic acid,

2616
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:35.040
malic acid,
a couple different um,
amino acids.

2617
02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:38.820
Caffeine though.
So there's more caffeine on top of it.

2618
02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:43.620
And the energy blend,
right?
Or is that blend where the caffeine comes from?

2619
02:23:43.621 --> 02:23:48.480
I guess the caffeine comes from that blind.
Yeah.
So what is,
um,
what is,
um,

2620
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:51.780
in the US car?
One is like,
oh two and a half cup.

2621
02:23:51.781 --> 02:23:54.310
Notice how they have Dunkin donuts coffee.
Not Tim Horton was.

2622
02:23:55.940 --> 02:24:00.150
So one of those is two and a half cans of fucking bread bowl.
See?

2623
02:24:00.151 --> 02:24:02.850
So that's what I think the articles I saw,
Whoa,

2624
02:24:02.851 --> 02:24:06.960
I'm totally wrong on this because the commercials would say that it's the same

2625
02:24:06.961 --> 02:24:11.820
as a cup of coffee.
Whoa.
That's weird.

2626
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:14.610
They,
I thought they were seeing that,
you know,
you know,
and again,

2627
02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:15.690
it goes to that abuse thing.

2628
02:24:15.691 --> 02:24:18.060
Just some people are overloading when they were doing schooling.

2629
02:24:18.061 --> 02:24:21.480
They're crushing like five and then they find it.
Yeah,
that's a shot.

2630
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:24.070
I mean it's like,
it's easy to do two or three of those.

2631
02:24:24.071 --> 02:24:26.520
So if you do four or five in a row,
yeah.

2632
02:24:26.521 --> 02:24:29.160
You're taking a thousand milligrams of caffeine.
I had no idea.

2633
02:24:29.161 --> 02:24:33.120
I thought it would for some reason I thought it was like 65 milligrams.
Okay.

2634
02:24:33.121 --> 02:24:37.020
Red Bull Rockstar.
Where's the coffee?
Well,

2635
02:24:37.050 --> 02:24:41.250
just find out where the Starbucks is.
Find out what Starbucks coffee is.
Um,

2636
02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:44.520
I think that a red line was like a really scary one.

2637
02:24:44.521 --> 02:24:46.920
Do you ever have one of those around more?

2638
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:51.240
I drank a half of one of those wants and I read and it was one of those several

2639
02:24:51.241 --> 02:24:55.460
servings per can.
Lot of big can either,
but it was like,
whoa.

2640
02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:58.890
Actually had a day in one of our shoots,
right.
I'd had too much,
uh,

2641
02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:04.040
energy drinks and the next day I actually felt like I was really hung over 16

2642
02:25:04.171 --> 02:25:08.860
ounces.
330 milligrams Po what?

2643
02:25:09.490 --> 02:25:10.260
Hmm.

2644
02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:14.800
Find out if that's universally true because,
well,

2645
02:25:14.850 --> 02:25:17.910
what's that one up?
There were numbers.
What's that?

2646
02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.040
Three 34 15 for the venti.
Oh my goodness.
To

2647
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.630
<v 1>60.
For a tall.
That's incredible.
Wow.</v>

2648
02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:33.130
That is crazy.
A tall has 260 milligrams,

2649
02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.120
but you know,
here's the other thing.
If you get like a coffee from a diner,

2650
02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:40.530
like a regular cup of coffee,
it's way less than that.
Yeah.

2651
02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:45.550
55 yeah.
Eight ounce.
Yeah.
Well what does it

2652
02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:52.150
does?
DECAF.
The 55 one 23 eight ounce.
Yeah.

2653
02:25:52.151 --> 02:25:56.020
Okay.
Eight ounce brewed cup of coffee from a regular,
you know,

2654
02:25:56.021 --> 02:26:01.021
place is somewhere in the neighborhood of 133 if it's instant coffee,

2655
02:26:01.781 --> 02:26:04.450
it's 93 that's a big difference.

2656
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:08.250
One 33 and two 60 fucking amen.

2657
02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.900
And three 30 for a venti.
That's insane.

2658
02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.890
That's a lot of God recommended daily limits.
So yeah.
So if you had a,
you know,

2659
02:26:14.891 --> 02:26:19.240
400 is supposed to be the daily limit and if you have students doing four or

2660
02:26:19.241 --> 02:26:21.820
five of those five hour energies,
right,
you're going up to thousand,

2661
02:26:21.821 --> 02:26:26.530
you're putting yourself at risky levels and it's so easy to do the shot done.

2662
02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:30.970
It's all energy.
Things are weird,
man,
because there's so prevalent.

2663
02:26:30.971 --> 02:26:33.580
We're always looking for that boost.
That little pick me up,

2664
02:26:33.581 --> 02:26:37.360
but we don't want to take pills.
Pills are bad drink.
But like you said,

2665
02:26:37.390 --> 02:26:39.520
I'm like if I give myself a treat now,

2666
02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:41.620
cause I try not to have energy drinks on the weekend,
I'll be like,

2667
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:43.720
oh I have a sugar free red bull and a snickers.
Right?

2668
02:26:43.721 --> 02:26:48.190
Like I'll go get you a little crazy.
I get crazy because,
uh,

2669
02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:50.350
well the kids are eating sugar all fucking day long.

2670
02:26:50.351 --> 02:26:52.960
So I get jealous cause I did you let your kids eat sugar all the time?

2671
02:26:52.961 --> 02:26:56.440
Like not all the time,
but there's no,
well they get into it.

2672
02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:58.930
My boy is such a little Ninja.

2673
02:26:58.931 --> 02:27:03.010
We put all the candy aisle like way high to where I have to reach up.
It's on.

2674
02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:07.450
And that guy,
he pushes the goddamn stools in.
It's in a Pantry,
opens the door,

2675
02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:10.600
pushes it up,
and he'll get up there and reach up the licorice.

2676
02:27:10.601 --> 02:27:12.890
And then we'd come down and were like,
hey,
where'd you get that?
And he's like,

2677
02:27:12.891 --> 02:27:16.510
from the pantry.
Like,
how old is he?
Three.
How about you keep an eye on you?

2678
02:27:16.511 --> 02:27:19.380
Three year old.
You fucking Jesus Christ.
Just letting them wander.
Well,

2679
02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:23.140
what about the knives?
Let him pick up the,
where'd you get the gun son?
What?
Oh,

2680
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.330
found it.
Don't we just let them play with a butcher's knife?

2681
02:27:25.331 --> 02:27:28.960
It's not the other one.
So
yeah,
it's um,

2682
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:31.180
the sugar thing is a big draw for kids,
man.

2683
02:27:31.181 --> 02:27:34.880
It's crazy when you see you like my daughter had a party recently and uh,

2684
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:38.080
when it came time to cut the cake until his little mother fuckers come over with

2685
02:27:38.081 --> 02:27:41.600
a glazed look like you're asking me.
I have a big piece.
Yeah.

2686
02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:45.820
Have a whipped cream all the way cream.
A little crazy little eyes.

2687
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:49.420
Crazy sugar eyes.
It's just weird.
Like you're giving them a drug,
you know,

2688
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:54.300
delicious drug fucking cake's awesome.
I'm not,
I'm not anti cake,

2689
02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:57.260
but I'm just saying there's something weird about seeing like little five year

2690
02:27:57.270 --> 02:28:01.490
olds all glassy eyed lining up to get k and it's all they like.

2691
02:28:01.491 --> 02:28:04.300
I mean we're really big and then you know,
fit in.
Our kids are pretty good.

2692
02:28:04.301 --> 02:28:06.970
Like they eat fish and they eat vegetables,
but they always want like,

2693
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:10.090
I mean when it time for candidates suites is what they're pushing for all the

2694
02:28:10.091 --> 02:28:11.740
time.
It's really unnatural.

2695
02:28:11.810 --> 02:28:16.810
The concentration of processed sugar in our foods is so unnatural and the body's

2696
02:28:17.231 --> 02:28:19.720
just not designed for it.
And the rush that it gets for it,

2697
02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:23.030
you know for that it's your body wants to recreate that rush.

2698
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:27.180
Like kids fucking love it.
Like if I'm a kid that doesn't love candy now,

2699
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.390
they all love it.
It's just,
it's gross.

2700
02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.340
And there's probably a documentary in that.
There I that's,

2701
02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:36.020
it's an interesting one that gives a lot of times when people will,

2702
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:38.930
there's not too many that come and try to like debate me on Twitter and stuff.

2703
02:28:38.931 --> 02:28:39.950
They don't last very long.

2704
02:28:39.951 --> 02:28:42.560
If they do and they tried to bring up wiki stupid arguments like,

2705
02:28:42.561 --> 02:28:45.170
well you're going to be as marijuana.
And I was like,
yeah,
you shut up.

2706
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:49.100
You can have used just about anything.
That's a silly argument.
So stupid.

2707
02:28:49.101 --> 02:28:51.680
Those arguments are so they're,
they're mind numbing to me.

2708
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:53.960
Like the Nancy Grace One,
I mean there's a,

2709
02:28:53.961 --> 02:28:56.960
there's a picture of me and Nancy Gray side by side with Nancy grace talking

2710
02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:58.970
about how it makes you fat.

2711
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:04.130
We posted that and it got like some of the more like 14,000 likes or something

2712
02:29:04.131 --> 02:29:07.130
like that.
It's the whole thing is silly.
If you are a lazy person,

2713
02:29:07.131 --> 02:29:09.500
you're going to be a lazy person.
It's that simple.

2714
02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:14.850
Even a person who's like really fit and healthy might occasionally like tying

2715
02:29:14.910 --> 02:29:19.310
one on with their friends.
It's fun.
Sometimes it's just moderation.
You know,

2716
02:29:19.311 --> 02:29:19.581
there's,

2717
02:29:19.581 --> 02:29:22.670
there's plenty of things that you can do that aren't necessarily healthy if you

2718
02:29:22.671 --> 02:29:25.220
do them all the time.
But there you're not going to really pay.

2719
02:29:25.221 --> 02:29:28.180
The price is a thing that is to say he did,

2720
02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:30.820
but this was the thing that came up with that,
you know,

2721
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:34.580
the law enforced me interviewed is that if the whole idea when you hear the

2722
02:29:34.581 --> 02:29:38.120
other side is to reduce harm,
right?
If that's what they're selling you on.
Like,

2723
02:29:38.121 --> 02:29:41.180
look,
we can't allow marijuana cause we're going to reduce harm.

2724
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.390
Harming somebody further with a criminal record,

2725
02:29:44.391 --> 02:29:45.860
take away their right to education,

2726
02:29:45.861 --> 02:29:50.030
preventing them from job opportunities and preventing them from traveling is far

2727
02:29:50.031 --> 02:29:52.220
more harmful than not only just marijuana,

2728
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:57.110
but a lot of other illegal drugs too because statistics show even the most

2729
02:29:57.111 --> 02:29:59.210
addictive drugs.
It's like,
I think even heroin,

2730
02:29:59.211 --> 02:30:03.710
the highest is like 30% like it's a lot of people have used drugs and then don't

2731
02:30:03.711 --> 02:30:06.590
continue to abuse them.
Well,
it's kind of a false narrative though really,

2732
02:30:06.591 --> 02:30:09.710
because no one is really trying to protect anyone.

2733
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:14.690
They're just trying to utilize the clause in the law that allows them to

2734
02:30:14.691 --> 02:30:17.190
imprison you.
Yeah,
that's really what it is.
And they,

2735
02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:20.720
they get people to fill their prison.

2736
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:23.390
They get people to go through their legal system,

2737
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:25.220
so they validate the legal system,

2738
02:30:25.221 --> 02:30:27.860
they validate the amount of police officers that they need.

2739
02:30:27.861 --> 02:30:31.160
They validate the amount of prison space they need and it all feeds into this

2740
02:30:31.161 --> 02:30:34.460
business,
which was also,
you guys talked about in the culture,
high,

2741
02:30:34.461 --> 02:30:37.970
big on the law enforcement part is a lot of people's favor as well because it's

2742
02:30:37.971 --> 02:30:41.210
terrifying when you realize that there's so much momentum behind that and

2743
02:30:41.211 --> 02:30:42.044
there's so much,

2744
02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:45.710
they have so much motivation to keep those laws in place so they can continue

2745
02:30:45.711 --> 02:30:49.670
arresting people because if they don't,
that industry implodes.

2746
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:54.910
50% of the law enforcement and the arrest in this country have to do with

2747
02:30:55.550 --> 02:30:57.800
nonviolent crimes that involve drugs.

2748
02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:00.470
It's a skate like ed burns who closes the film,
right?

2749
02:31:00.471 --> 02:31:02.300
That was a cocreator of HBO is the wire.

2750
02:31:02.301 --> 02:31:04.190
He's the cop that you see throughout the film.

2751
02:31:04.191 --> 02:31:08.030
That's like he's scary when you sit down with him and he breaks it down how it

2752
02:31:08.031 --> 02:31:11.450
is.
Right.
And when you think about seizures of assets and stuff,

2753
02:31:11.451 --> 02:31:14.690
like you don't get to do that for murderers and rapists,
although you should.

2754
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:20.190
So their incentivize like murderers and rapists fall below as far as pro profit

2755
02:31:20.191 --> 02:31:24.050
incentive for precincts because they don't get to take their money.

2756
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:27.500
Good asset for,
for drugs.
They do crazy crazy.

2757
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:30.970
Like if you're a murderer or a rapist,
they can't take your TV.
Yeah.

2758
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:34.440
But if you got to like a roll of joints in a plastic bag,
boom,

2759
02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:38.400
they just come in and start taking your shit and sell shit.
It's just,

2760
02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:42.450
there's just so many bad laws that are in place.
It's almost overwhelming.

2761
02:31:42.451 --> 02:31:46.020
And I think for a lot of people we get really frustrated because it seems like

2762
02:31:46.021 --> 02:31:50.520
there's,
you can't fix it all.
Like I'm 47 I'll be 48 in August,

2763
02:31:50.521 --> 02:31:53.820
which means I'm almost 50 I'm,
you know,

2764
02:31:53.821 --> 02:31:58.350
I'm a fucking middle aged man at if I'm lucky,
I'm a middle aged man,

2765
02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:02.700
I'm a grown up,
100% grown up.
Right.
This is as grown up as you get.

2766
02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:08.180
And yet I'm still immersed in this system that has been in this position or

2767
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:12.660
similar position since I was a child.
Very little has changed,
you know?

2768
02:32:12.661 --> 02:32:17.490
So there's been some movement towards sanity and clarity and legalization and

2769
02:32:17.491 --> 02:32:18.324
freedom,

2770
02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:21.660
but there's still this asset forfeiture thing that guy with the convenience

2771
02:32:21.661 --> 02:32:26.160
store that are stealing his money and you know the numbers that they've posted

2772
02:32:26.161 --> 02:32:30.780
of a asset forfeiture takeovers over the last year or two.
It's staggering.

2773
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:34.830
And it's unfucking believable how much money it is and the murder conviction

2774
02:32:34.831 --> 02:32:36.090
rate that we brought up in the film.

2775
02:32:36.091 --> 02:32:39.780
How was actually higher earlier because the cops say one of the biggest things

2776
02:32:39.781 --> 02:32:41.100
is that resources,

2777
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:45.060
we no longer have communication with the community so we can no longer prevent

2778
02:32:45.061 --> 02:32:48.810
the crimes.
Even with all our technology,
forensics,
DNA,
everything else,
murder,

2779
02:32:48.811 --> 02:32:51.320
conviction rates have gone drastically down.
Yeah,

2780
02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:56.010
they've turned cops essentially into glorified revenue collectors.

2781
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:58.610
That's what they've done.
I mean,
could you imagine this is,

2782
02:32:58.620 --> 02:32:59.880
we were talking about this once.

2783
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.560
Could you imagine if they made soldiers write tickets in Afghanistan,

2784
02:33:05.490 --> 02:33:06.030
you know,

2785
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:09.750
you match of soldiers had a quota and they had to get money from the Taliban.

2786
02:33:09.751 --> 02:33:11.790
Hey,
you fucks.
Sorry,
I saw you making an IED.

2787
02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:16.710
You're doing court on Tuesday and here's your piece of paper.
Like the,
no,
no.

2788
02:33:16.890 --> 02:33:19.140
Soldiers are over there doing soldier type shit.

2789
02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:21.750
Will cop should be doing cop type shit.
Okay.

2790
02:33:21.751 --> 02:33:26.070
It should be arresting people for committing dangerous crimes that that put us

2791
02:33:26.071 --> 02:33:29.570
all in in harms way.
We'll even,
Sean done again,

2792
02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.910
who's the former DEA analyst that we interviewed him.

2793
02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:35.430
He talked about his dad who was a beat cop in New York and he said when his dad

2794
02:33:35.431 --> 02:33:40.140
went to work,
it was like a sports coat.
His shirt,
his badge,
his gun.
He's like,

2795
02:33:40.141 --> 02:33:44.220
and that's how we work the beat.
He's like,
now it's military boots and he sings.

2796
02:33:44.221 --> 02:33:45.180
He's like,
how do you,

2797
02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:48.360
how does the community feel like you're part of the community when you're

2798
02:33:48.361 --> 02:33:51.750
dressed like a soldier?
Like right away,
you know,
impressions and stuff.

2799
02:33:51.751 --> 02:33:54.540
That all matters,
right?
Like you don't feel,

2800
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:57.660
communities don't feel welcome when that comes in.
If he was like,

2801
02:33:57.661 --> 02:33:58.441
there's a major problem,

2802
02:33:58.441 --> 02:34:01.950
but if a beat cops got a sports coat and his bulletproof vest underneath his

2803
02:34:01.951 --> 02:34:05.130
dress shirt and he's working to be like,
hey,
like look,
there's a missing girl.

2804
02:34:05.131 --> 02:34:06.360
Has there been anything suspicious?
Well,

2805
02:34:06.361 --> 02:34:09.420
there's a house on the end of the street,
but when military soldiers come up,

2806
02:34:09.421 --> 02:34:10.470
you're like Kinda like,
Whoa,

2807
02:34:10.471 --> 02:34:13.620
are you going to come raid my house or you're going to come beat us up?
Right?

2808
02:34:13.621 --> 02:34:17.710
Like it's not where a community wants to welcome them and considers them part of

2809
02:34:17.711 --> 02:34:18.370
the community.

2810
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:21.610
<v 2>I think it also does something for the mentality of the people that are wearing</v>

2811
02:34:21.611 --> 02:34:24.490
the military garb to absolutely up in a tank.

2812
02:34:24.491 --> 02:34:27.160
You're going to have a totally different attitude then you step out of a fucking

2813
02:34:27.161 --> 02:34:29.190
Crown Victoria.
Exactly.
That.

2814
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:34.010
Were those things called those police cars ltd crown Victorias I would.

2815
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:36.190
Those things are,
yeah.
You know what I mean?
It's like

2816
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:42.520
police officers should be respected and appreciated members of the community

2817
02:34:42.521 --> 02:34:46.300
that you call upon when the shit hits the fan and when you put them in a

2818
02:34:46.301 --> 02:34:49.030
position where they were arresting people for pot or where you put them in a

2819
02:34:49.031 --> 02:34:52.810
position where they're being forced in these asset forfeiture situations.

2820
02:34:53.020 --> 02:34:54.940
Even giving them the license to do.

2821
02:34:54.941 --> 02:34:59.800
That becomes problematic because when you tell someone it's okay for them to do

2822
02:34:59.801 --> 02:35:03.190
it,
then they don't even have the opportunity to go,
well,
hey,

2823
02:35:03.191 --> 02:35:05.890
you know morally is this right?
Well it doesn't matter if it's right.

2824
02:35:05.891 --> 02:35:09.970
That's the job.
The job is take the money,
arrest the guy.
Like that's the job.

2825
02:35:09.971 --> 02:35:10.510
That's agenda.

2826
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:14.110
You become used to that job and it becomes fuck them and then it becomes us

2827
02:35:14.111 --> 02:35:15.980
versus them though.

2828
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.890
That attitude is the worst aspect of the relationship between law enforcement

2829
02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:24.520
and civilians and we need law enforcement.
You know we've talked about this,

2830
02:35:24.521 --> 02:35:29.521
a situation that happened in Baltimore where an rt reporter was filming these

2831
02:35:31.241 --> 02:35:32.140
young kids.

2832
02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:36.550
They were jumping around and saying a bunch of Shit and then one of the kids

2833
02:35:36.551 --> 02:35:40.000
takes her fucking purse and runs and she's chasing after him.

2834
02:35:40.001 --> 02:35:44.260
Give me my purse back in that bag back and she's,
as she's chasing this kid,

2835
02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:48.550
a cop grabs the guy,
the cops grabbed the guy and get her purse back.

2836
02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:51.850
Like you see like everyone's so down in the cops,
everyone.

2837
02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.960
So anti law enforcement here is a situation where law enforcement actually did

2838
02:35:55.961 --> 02:36:00.400
its duty and it happened in the midst of chaos where law enforcement has failed,

2839
02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:02.920
you know,
chaos,
law enforcement killed somebody.

2840
02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.350
This is huge riots that have come up because of that,

2841
02:36:05.351 --> 02:36:08.950
this huge separation between the community and the people that are supposedly

2842
02:36:08.951 --> 02:36:13.780
protecting that community and this huge rift.
But then you see like,
oh okay,

2843
02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.520
like there is a time where law enforcement is not just beneficial but necessary.

2844
02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:22.790
I have,
I mean there's no question you need law enforcement.
Yeah.

2845
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:26.170
It's just interesting with like interviewing a lot of these very respect to

2846
02:36:26.171 --> 02:36:29.890
police officers and how they really talk about how it was the fundamental

2847
02:36:29.891 --> 02:36:34.720
breakdown of dividing them,
making them the enemy,
like the drug war to them.

2848
02:36:34.721 --> 02:36:37.540
They just said,
look,
I saw it.
It's separated communities.

2849
02:36:37.541 --> 02:36:41.710
It made us look as the other cause.
Look if Joe,
we both have children,

2850
02:36:41.711 --> 02:36:42.820
if something happened to them,

2851
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:46.780
you want justice to be done and then if the cops are coming,
like what happened?

2852
02:36:46.781 --> 02:36:49.480
Did someone go missing?
Did someone hurt them?
You want that there.

2853
02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:52.690
But if that communication is broken and it feels more like now I'm getting

2854
02:36:52.691 --> 02:36:55.600
interrogated,
well what did you do?
And they come bullying you and uh,

2855
02:36:55.601 --> 02:36:58.470
we found drugs.
Maybe it's your fault that this happened.
It's like,
no,

2856
02:36:58.510 --> 02:37:00.760
someone hurt my kids.
Like just focus on them.

2857
02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:03.730
Whereas also that's also just dummies that are cops.

2858
02:37:04.090 --> 02:37:06.260
The problem is there's not a lot of,

2859
02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:09.460
like in Los Angeles they have these fucking billboards trying to get people to

2860
02:37:09.461 --> 02:37:12.160
become cops cause nobody wants to be a cop.
You know?

2861
02:37:12.161 --> 02:37:16.430
And it's an incredibly tough job.
Like super dangerous,
massively stressful.

2862
02:37:16.431 --> 02:37:19.100
The PTSD these guys get,
nobody brings up,

2863
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:23.630
everybody talks about soldier Ptsd and very few people respect the PTSD that

2864
02:37:23.631 --> 02:37:26.510
cops have cause they fucking have it.
Man.
You know a,

2865
02:37:26.511 --> 02:37:30.110
a friend of mine was telling me about this guy who jumped off of a building and

2866
02:37:30.111 --> 02:37:34.010
all these cops were around and they were taking care of the situation.
Then they,

2867
02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:37.610
a one cop showed up with donuts and they started handing doughnuts out and these

2868
02:37:37.611 --> 02:37:39.470
guys are eating donuts while they're,
you know,

2869
02:37:39.471 --> 02:37:42.620
taking witness accounts and dealing with this.
There was so over it,

2870
02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:43.790
they're just so over it.

2871
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.140
Like they watch this guy splatter and become asphalt pizza,
you know,

2872
02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:51.590
jumped off of a building and they're like,
all right another day in the job.

2873
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:54.560
Like ultimately that has got us fuck with your head.

2874
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:58.280
One of my good buddies from high schools become a cop in Canada and he was

2875
02:37:58.281 --> 02:37:59.300
talking about some of the first,

2876
02:37:59.301 --> 02:38:02.000
like the first dead body you saw with someone that blew their head off with a

2877
02:38:02.001 --> 02:38:02.480
shotgun.

2878
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:05.690
They'd use state cause you have to use like a stick in order to reach it or

2879
02:38:05.691 --> 02:38:06.111
something.

2880
02:38:06.111 --> 02:38:09.500
And then their whole face had caved in and they were the first ones on scene and

2881
02:38:09.501 --> 02:38:12.860
the smell.
And I was like,
dude,
I like,
how do you even react that?
He's like,

2882
02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:15.960
I just pretend it's like a video game,
right?
Like I just,

2883
02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:18.590
I have to kind of zone out and wait for the cleanup crew.

2884
02:38:18.591 --> 02:38:22.130
And I couldn't imagine seeing that even once a year if you had to come up on

2885
02:38:22.131 --> 02:38:23.270
that kind of stuff.
Like right.

2886
02:38:23.271 --> 02:38:27.110
And they're seeing it all the time and everybody they run into on a daily basis

2887
02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:32.500
is either lying to them or nervous about meeting them or is hiding something or

2888
02:38:33.350 --> 02:38:37.130
you know,
it's just fuck man.
I mean it's a terrible job.

2889
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:41.960
It's really hard to do and made way worse by the drug war.
Way Worse Way,

2890
02:38:41.961 --> 02:38:46.610
way,
way worse that that fucking scenario where those guys and when it starts out

2891
02:38:46.611 --> 02:38:47.360
your film,

2892
02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.770
when those guys shoot that dog like that just should show you right away.

2893
02:38:51.771 --> 02:38:53.180
We're talking about pot.

2894
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:56.450
We're not talking about anything that's going to hurt anybody.

2895
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:58.190
We're talking about pot.
And because of that,

2896
02:38:58.191 --> 02:39:02.780
these guys felt like they had the writing on the paper that allowed them to go

2897
02:39:02.781 --> 02:39:05.870
in there and shoot a dog and scare the fuck out of break into your house at

2898
02:39:05.871 --> 02:39:09.410
three in the morning with your kids in the house and shoot your until hog.

2899
02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:12.650
Meanwhile,
if that was handled better,
I mean it would be a comfortable liquid.

2900
02:39:12.670 --> 02:39:17.310
He got in there.
It was a pipe.
Okay,
well throw this out.
Give you a citation.

2901
02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:19.710
I mean,
do they even give you a citation when you have a pipe?
I mean,

2902
02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:22.970
within to do,
you're going to write them up,
make them go to court or something.

2903
02:39:22.970 --> 02:39:26.930
Okay.
Just don't shoot this fucking dog.
Like the whole thing is just,
it's,

2904
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:31.840
it's insanity.
It's insanity on an almost like a fictional level.
Like it,

2905
02:39:31.841 --> 02:39:35.210
it seems like it's fiction.
Like it's a work of like,

2906
02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.440
it's some crazy George Orwell book from,
you know,

2907
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:44.450
the olden days before we,
uh,
before we figured out how to live life.

2908
02:39:44.451 --> 02:39:45.970
But we haven't figured out how to live life.

2909
02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:48.230
We haven't figured out that if there's anything I've learned,

2910
02:39:48.231 --> 02:39:49.280
we haven't figured out shit.

2911
02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:54.020
But don't you think that because of like these kind of conversations and because

2912
02:39:54.021 --> 02:39:55.730
of the Internet and you know,

2913
02:39:55.731 --> 02:40:00.731
the backlash that all these archaic drug laws and drug policies have had,

2914
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:03.560
the backlash has been unprecedented.

2915
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:07.200
The amount of people that react to it today as opposed to the way they treated

2916
02:40:07.201 --> 02:40:10.760
it in the 80s during the Reagan administration.
It's very,
very different.
I mean,

2917
02:40:10.761 --> 02:40:14.400
it's changing all over.
I mean,
the UK is challenging right now.
Portugal

2918
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.510
<v 0>decriminalized all drugs 10 years ago and had great success.
In fact,</v>

2919
02:40:18.511 --> 02:40:21.630
we interviewed one of the scientists that went in research that for a little
bit.

2920
02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:22.860
Uh,
Doctor uh,

2921
02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:27.240
Julian hurt in the UK and he said everyone that was against them originally

2922
02:40:27.241 --> 02:40:31.200
bringing in that bill is now can't believe that they were fighting against it.

2923
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:32.970
Like violent crime has gone down.

2924
02:40:32.971 --> 02:40:36.300
They said now we can focus on the heart and criminal criminals and the big

2925
02:40:36.301 --> 02:40:39.750
traffickers and less time like,
and the people that have substance abuse,

2926
02:40:39.751 --> 02:40:42.810
they've seen teenage use down all these things down,

2927
02:40:42.811 --> 02:40:44.670
like all the horror stories you're hearing.

2928
02:40:44.671 --> 02:40:48.000
And then Uruguay and Canada's changing policies and us,

2929
02:40:48.001 --> 02:40:51.360
every other state seems to be challenging looking for medical legalization or

2930
02:40:51.361 --> 02:40:52.470
then full legalization,

2931
02:40:52.471 --> 02:40:56.970
like as the end of the film kind of says like the house of cards is collapsing

2932
02:40:56.971 --> 02:41:00.510
fast and things like these podcasts and access information and getting the,

2933
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:04.290
even the way we release the film where we put it on Vimeo right away where

2934
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:07.950
everyone in the world could get it.
And then now it's on Netflix in,

2935
02:41:08.430 --> 02:41:12.240
I think it's a 70 different countries in 14 different languages,

2936
02:41:12.241 --> 02:41:16.380
like you didn't have that years ago,
right?
Like now it's Portuguese.
Dutch.
I see.

2937
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:20.910
It feels great when you work so hard on something,
then you can search,
you know,

2938
02:41:20.911 --> 02:41:24.000
on Twitter and we go on there and we'll search the culture high and you'll see

2939
02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:27.900
in Dutch and Spanish and Portuguese people saying,
wow,
this changed my mind.

2940
02:41:27.901 --> 02:41:29.340
It's amazing.
Like you didn't have,

2941
02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:31.560
you weren't able to reach out like that before.
Right.

2942
02:41:31.561 --> 02:41:35.160
There's a time and connectivity with podcasts and Internet.

2943
02:41:35.161 --> 02:41:37.680
We've talked about this in the film.
You kind of go actually,

2944
02:41:37.681 --> 02:41:42.450
like it's changing so quick and you can't bullshit people the way you used to.

2945
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:43.460
<v 2>Yeah.
And it's,</v>

2946
02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:48.460
it's only getting more and more in involved in people's lives.

2947
02:41:48.751 --> 02:41:51.570
It's only getting more and more invasive.
And I should,

2948
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:52.980
the word invasive sounds negative,

2949
02:41:52.981 --> 02:41:57.981
but the technology has allowed information to get to you so quickly.

2950
02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:01.830
It's virtually impossible to lie about facts now.

2951
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:07.020
It's just too hard.
It's just too hard.
I mean,
we're going to come,

2952
02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:08.880
there's gonna come a point in time,

2953
02:42:08.910 --> 02:42:13.910
some time in our lives where all this stuff has reached some sort of a boiling

2954
02:42:13.921 --> 02:42:17.300
point.
And that boiling point is,
it's,

2955
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:22.290
it's gonna make us look like fools for going through our lives the way we did

2956
02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:23.880
like in the eighties and the nineties.

2957
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:28.650
It's going to really make society look like a bunch of monkeys with guns and

2958
02:42:28.651 --> 02:42:32.570
badges and re pieces of paper with things written on it.
And,

2959
02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.860
and then we acted on those.
Like we're,

2960
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:37.830
we're going to look just as ridiculous as the people that were involved in the

2961
02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:40.260
inquisition or the people that were burning witches in Salem.

2962
02:42:40.650 --> 02:42:43.650
All that's actually,
I don't think they really burned witches.
Do you know that?

2963
02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:46.410
That's kind of bullshit.
Then they drown.
They drown them.

2964
02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:51.340
It was a lose lose where it was like,
if you don't drown your,
which,
yeah.

2965
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:53.490
And if you do drown,
sorry,
we fucked up.

2966
02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:57.060
Do you know what they think was the cause of all that?
Did you ever,
uh,

2967
02:42:57.090 --> 02:42:57.923
read into that?

2968
02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:03.240
They think it was ergot poisoning or God is a type of fungus that exists in

2969
02:43:03.241 --> 02:43:08.241
wheat that has a similar effect to LSD and they believe that it was because of a

2970
02:43:09.301 --> 02:43:14.301
late frost and that a lot of wheat got damaged and it causes this fungus to grow

2971
02:43:14.591 --> 02:43:17.950
in the wheat.
Like they did some samples,
core samples of the,

2972
02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:22.980
the dirt and they found like some certain climatological clues that lead them

2973
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:24.210
to,

2974
02:43:24.210 --> 02:43:28.930
to believe that that could have very possibly happened that ergot poisoning in

2975
02:43:28.931 --> 02:43:31.540
the week cause people to have these crazy acid like a fax.

2976
02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:34.630
And they thought there were bewitched.
It makes perfect sense.

2977
02:43:34.631 --> 02:43:38.250
I'd read some of this stuff to where it was some people were having like a

2978
02:43:38.290 --> 02:43:41.710
mistresses and stuff like that and it was a way to shut up the lower p like the

2979
02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:46.200
common folk.
Yeah.
Just be like,
you're a witch
honey.

2980
02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:51.100
I don't know.
I didn't look deep into that.
So maybe,
well,

2981
02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:54.390
I'm sure people have done horrible things in the past and uh,

2982
02:43:54.970 --> 02:43:57.460
they will continue to do so until we can read minds.

2983
02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:59.680
I think that's going to be the big one,
man.
Once we,

2984
02:43:59.681 --> 02:44:03.640
once we have some sort of a way to read each other's own mental database.

2985
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:06.580
I've heard Richard Talk about that in the podcast and I agreed so much where

2986
02:44:06.581 --> 02:44:09.730
it's just like if he took lying off the table instantly it was like you were

2987
02:44:09.731 --> 02:44:12.550
tapped in and it was like as soon as somebody said something,
he was like,

2988
02:44:12.551 --> 02:44:15.220
we are all tapped into Google.
Like essentially it was built and he's like,
oh,

2989
02:44:15.221 --> 02:44:17.800
he's lying.
Like I've got the information.
That's bullshit.
Right?

2990
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:20.710
Like not only that and you forget about it.
Even information.

2991
02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.150
How about your own thoughts and feelings?
Like don't be a bully.

2992
02:44:24.210 --> 02:44:26.830
Like if you're not a politician or a bullshit artist.

2993
02:44:27.250 --> 02:44:31.060
Like if I could see if I could look at you and I see green,

2994
02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:34.750
which means everything's groovy and then as soon as it turns yellow up,

2995
02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:38.290
Adam might be bullshit.
Yeah,
good.
We went red.
Yeah.

2996
02:44:38.410 --> 02:44:40.870
I mean that's not outside of the realm of possibility.

2997
02:44:40.871 --> 02:44:42.760
They've already shown that they can tell.

2998
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.540
There's certain things that they could read in a person's brain if they're being

2999
02:44:46.541 --> 02:44:47.380
deceptive.

3000
02:44:47.381 --> 02:44:52.381
And they've even used f MRI in a case in India to convict a woman of a crime

3001
02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:58.090
because she had what they call functional knowledge of the crime scene.

3002
02:44:58.630 --> 02:45:02.710
And it's very controversial and neuroscientist MRI,

3003
02:45:02.711 --> 02:45:07.670
which is functional Mri magnetic resonance imagery and um,
well,
you know,

3004
02:45:07.690 --> 02:45:10.720
Mri they have,
if you have an injury and well look at the,
um,

3005
02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:15.740
the tissue functional MRI is a type of Mri they use to scan brain activity and

3006
02:45:18.761 --> 02:45:22.460
they believe that this is like the baby steps to be able,

3007
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:25.960
being able to actually read the mind definitively.

3008
02:45:25.961 --> 02:45:28.120
Like right now they're getting these signals and the signals are very

3009
02:45:28.121 --> 02:45:31.030
controversial because some people say,
well,

3010
02:45:31.031 --> 02:45:35.920
having a functional knowledge of the crime scene could have been imparted on her

3011
02:45:35.921 --> 02:45:39.040
by the case,
by the evidence,

3012
02:45:39.041 --> 02:45:42.130
by reviewing the evidence with the lawyers.
Like somehow or another,

3013
02:45:42.131 --> 02:45:45.250
they could've imparted this somehow in her mind or you know,

3014
02:45:45.251 --> 02:45:49.430
being interrogated or investigated about it.
Um,
but the,

3015
02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:55.020
the point being that they're starting to hone in on various aspects of the brain

3016
02:45:56.021 --> 02:45:56.680
and various,

3017
02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:00.520
like whether or not you're deceptive or nervous or whether or not like,

3018
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:02.980
and who knows what right now this is like the,

3019
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:07.981
this is the Morse Code of mine living in a day as opposed to high speed video on

3020
02:46:08.351 --> 02:46:10.520
Vimeo,
which is what we got now.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

3021
02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:12.890
Think about the difference between just a couple of hundred years ago,

3022
02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:14.600
if you were on the other side of the world,

3023
02:46:14.601 --> 02:46:16.680
they would have to send a series of fucking BBB,

3024
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:20.780
BBB and technology's accelerating at a pace that we've never seen.

3025
02:46:20.781 --> 02:46:23.520
Things are coming out every day and I can't even believe,
I'm like,

3026
02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:25.370
like three d printing blows my mind.

3027
02:46:25.371 --> 02:46:28.280
I don't know how they're like reprinting ears and like Oregon's like what are

3028
02:46:28.281 --> 02:46:30.830
they using as material?
I don't understand that.
I don't,

3029
02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:31.960
I don't get how that works.

3030
02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:36.410
Well w the Oregon thing is not three d printing with the Oregon thing is that

3031
02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:39.070
they're taking tissue samples and stem cells and they're,

3032
02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:42.890
they're using skin cells to create new bladders for people.
They,

3033
02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:45.290
they built this woman and Esophagus,

3034
02:46:45.291 --> 02:46:49.550
she had esophageal cancer and they used a three d printer to make like the

3035
02:46:49.551 --> 02:46:53.480
scaffolding for the cells and the cells grew and then should they replaced her

3036
02:46:53.481 --> 02:46:56.490
esophagus like fucking bananas.
But the,

3037
02:46:56.790 --> 02:47:00.050
I think like the exponential growth of this sort of technology.

3038
02:47:00.051 --> 02:47:01.940
If you apply like look at communication,

3039
02:47:01.941 --> 02:47:06.941
you apply it to like Morse code to a high speed video that's available streaming

3040
02:47:07.131 --> 02:47:09.440
on your phone.
Yeah,
he's amazing leap.

3041
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:14.950
I think that same thing applied to the mind and to understanding the signals of

3042
02:47:15.321 --> 02:47:16.430
the mind is gone.

3043
02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:21.440
Almost leave us in a position where we have no choice but to be honest and when

3044
02:47:21.651 --> 02:47:25.100
we have no choice,
but to be honest,
we're going to live in a different world.

3045
02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:26.980
There's going to be no more cults.
Dell,

3046
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:30.740
the whole Scientology thing's going to go out the window.
The Vatican was labs.

3047
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:35.950
While that Shit's going down and it's going to go down just based on information

3048
02:47:35.961 --> 02:47:39.350
and truth,
the ability to recognize that someone,

3049
02:47:39.351 --> 02:47:43.310
and it's still opinions are still gonna exist,
there's still going to be debate.

3050
02:47:43.350 --> 02:47:44.210
You know,
you could,
you could,

3051
02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:48.080
you could believe what you're saying and be truthful in your opinions.

3052
02:47:48.350 --> 02:47:52.810
Then it'll come a matter of the distribution of information disproving you and

3053
02:47:52.850 --> 02:47:57.140
getting into and then finding out,
oh well it's purple.
He's self deceptive.

3054
02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:59.890
Like this is what's going on.
This guy's got a blockage in.
Yeah.

3055
02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:03.830
Cause I mean if that's something that really fascinated going clear is just like

3056
02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.150
how this guy that seem to have some kind of mental illness.

3057
02:48:08.151 --> 02:48:10.610
He was trying to diagnose himself,
like constantly putting him,

3058
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:15.110
how he was able to convince people.
So infallibly to like follow him.

3059
02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:18.290
Like where he had them out on a ship and he was hiding and country your shirt.

3060
02:48:18.310 --> 02:48:22.460
Yeah.
Look at your shirt.
You see that shirt doesn't chimp.
Yeah,
that's,

3061
02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:23.870
that's the problem.

3062
02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:28.460
We have chimp DNA still in our system and that it chimp that you're wearing on

3063
02:48:28.461 --> 02:48:32.750
your tee shirt.
Chimps that's a big part of our fucking ancestry,

3064
02:48:32.751 --> 02:48:36.510
the following Alpha male behavior.
And you know,

3065
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:37.970
ultimately that's archaic.

3066
02:48:37.971 --> 02:48:42.410
And ultimately this does need to find someone that it used to be the tribal

3067
02:48:42.411 --> 02:48:42.771
leader,

3068
02:48:42.771 --> 02:48:47.150
the old gray man with the scars that learned from all of the mistakes and could

3069
02:48:47.151 --> 02:48:50.330
impart his wisdom on you and make your life a little bit easier because this

3070
02:48:50.331 --> 02:48:54.140
guy's already learned these things and he can he teach me?
I mean,

3071
02:48:54.141 --> 02:48:58.100
we all know that we all have had mentor figures when we were growing up as a

3072
02:48:58.101 --> 02:49:02.570
person who is older than us,
that perhaps had more wisdom,
more life experience,

3073
02:49:02.571 --> 02:49:06.470
and could cut a lot of the learning stages out,

3074
02:49:06.650 --> 02:49:08.430
cut a of the pitfalls

3075
02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:13.200
<v 1>that you might experience the trial and error.
And I think that,
you know,</v>

3076
02:49:13.201 --> 02:49:16.440
that's,
that's a big part of what's wrong with people as we,

3077
02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:19.520
we get scared when we don't have answers.
What about that?

3078
02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.440
The part that was interesting to me,
that was like how you even had people like,

3079
02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:25.160
like Paul Haggis and stuff like,
uh,
caught up in that world.

3080
02:49:25.161 --> 02:49:27.720
I was really young though.
You know when you're really young,

3081
02:49:27.721 --> 02:49:31.260
you really impressionable and I coulda got sucked into dynamics when I was

3082
02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:31.651
younger.

3083
02:49:31.651 --> 02:49:34.860
I know I could of the beginning parts of it are pretty key like you said,

3084
02:49:34.861 --> 02:49:36.980
the science and like making well like I was like,
ah,

3085
02:49:36.981 --> 02:49:40.690
I can see why I think I got tested like several years ago.
Are they going here?

3086
02:49:40.691 --> 02:49:42.180
And like when were you thinking about right there.

3087
02:49:42.181 --> 02:49:45.040
And it was like they were trying to hand out pamphlets actually.
Right.

3088
02:49:45.041 --> 02:49:47.010
By the way,
where the hotel,
where we're staying there.
Like here,

3089
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:50.280
I was just telling my,
my buddy that came with me trend,
I was like,
that's it.

3090
02:49:50.281 --> 02:49:53.220
That's science.
They say like,
do you want to do a personality test?
Right?

3091
02:49:53.221 --> 02:49:55.500
Like that's how it starts,
right?
Come on the little,

3092
02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:58.290
I did one in 2008,

3093
02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:03.740
2007 2008 and uh,
you know,
he held onto the cans like the whole thing and the,

3094
02:50:03.741 --> 02:50:06.270
the,
the,
the read the meter.
But the guy who was doing it with me,

3095
02:50:06.271 --> 02:50:10.650
it was like kind of depressed who's very like low enthusiasm.

3096
02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:13.980
It wasn't pitching it very well at all.
He's just a bummed out dude.

3097
02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:17.520
And you could tell like,
he just really wasn't into,
we give a shit.
It was weird.

3098
02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:20.730
It was just,
he kinda had to do,
he was only going to pay 25 cents or whatever.

3099
02:50:20.731 --> 02:50:22.960
Like the slate.
Yeah.

3100
02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.960
The sea or grind that they get insanely low.
You know,
I went on a,

3101
02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:33.030
like a youtube watching binge after I watched that documentary and that David

3102
02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:34.340
Miscavige,
whatever the guy's name is,
his,

3103
02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.290
his own niece wrote a book about him and you know,

3104
02:50:37.291 --> 02:50:41.150
she was one of the people that was in the sea org in like,
there's this,
yeah,
she,

3105
02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:45.240
she,
we got interviewed by,
what's that fuckheads name from England that was whoa.

3106
02:50:45.270 --> 02:50:49.790
Took over for Larry King for a while,
for the outset.
Um,
peers,
all warriors,

3107
02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:54.240
Morgan.
Um,
she,
uh,
um,

3108
02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:59.390
was on his show and just talking about the ridiculous existence that they lived,

3109
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.570
you know,

3110
02:51:00.570 --> 02:51:04.710
Ma maintaining all these different properties and all these different things

3111
02:51:04.711 --> 02:51:08.550
essentially through slave labor by all their employees and how they discourage

3112
02:51:08.551 --> 02:51:09.780
them from having children.

3113
02:51:09.781 --> 02:51:13.410
And they would try to get them to have abortions and just like,
oh,
is awful.

3114
02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:18.420
It was the thing that scared me the most about it too is that I could really see

3115
02:51:18.450 --> 02:51:22.710
a lot of similarities to other ideologies and the way that it managed its way

3116
02:51:22.711 --> 02:51:26.640
like it almost like it's a virus when you learn requirement based selling,
right.

3117
02:51:26.641 --> 02:51:29.250
I used to come from a sales background.
There's a way that humans can,

3118
02:51:29.251 --> 02:51:32.280
you find their business motives and buying objectives and you can kind of circle

3119
02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:36.600
around and get them emotional buys.
There's ways to just humans kind of react.

3120
02:51:36.601 --> 02:51:37.470
Right?
You get them excited.

3121
02:51:37.471 --> 02:51:40.050
Well does this bug you about your business or when you like a solution to that,

3122
02:51:40.051 --> 02:51:41.460
yes,
I would like a solution to that.
Right,

3123
02:51:41.461 --> 02:51:44.640
and then you can and that you'd see the similarities.

3124
02:51:44.641 --> 02:51:47.340
When I was watching that like yes,
I didn't tell Jean that movie freak me out,

3125
02:51:47.341 --> 02:51:48.001
but I was like,
man,

3126
02:51:48.001 --> 02:51:50.460
I could see how so many others would get you looped into that.
Right?

3127
02:51:50.461 --> 02:51:54.120
Like make you feel good and then make you feel part of a team and then suck you

3128
02:51:54.121 --> 02:51:58.440
in on this and give up your money.
It the whole thing freaked me out.

3129
02:51:58.441 --> 02:52:01.320
I thought Alex gave me,
he did great.
He's the top dog for docs right now.

3130
02:52:01.321 --> 02:52:05.170
Like Alex give me as the guy that as a documentary filmmaker we look up to like

3131
02:52:05.171 --> 02:52:08.880
he's the one that we definitely did a great job with that documentary,
but the,

3132
02:52:08.881 --> 02:52:12.430
the Scientologists are hounding him now.
Ne What do they do?

3133
02:52:12.431 --> 02:52:15.580
Like how they hounding and what does it,
what can they do?
I don't know,

3134
02:52:15.581 --> 02:52:18.910
other than she just watch it and go,
maybe we're crazy.

3135
02:52:19.870 --> 02:52:23.800
I smoke a joint,
wash that shit and go,
God,
what are we doing?
What are we doing?

3136
02:52:23.801 --> 02:52:27.430
This guy was nuts.
Maybe we can change it a little bit and make it better.
Right.

3137
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:31.980
When we see Tom Cruise Salute Lrh we did it her way.
Like,
Oh,

3138
02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:35.590
I really fucking scary marrying.
I love saluting him.

3139
02:52:35.591 --> 02:52:39.360
Like he's like an apostle like this.
We've done even better.

3140
02:52:39.370 --> 02:52:42.670
It's like he's military and then he'd get,
they give him that.

3141
02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:47.200
He's all excited like,
yes,
here's my metal.

3142
02:52:47.410 --> 02:52:51.370
Metal is like a fucking flavor flave clock one they just created for him.

3143
02:52:51.371 --> 02:52:53.050
It wasn't even according to the film.

3144
02:52:53.051 --> 02:52:56.050
It wasn't even something that was there before.
They just wanted,

3145
02:52:56.051 --> 02:52:59.500
what's his name that Miscavige created it to be like to kind of bring them back

3146
02:52:59.501 --> 02:53:03.970
in.
Like you're getting this metal that like nobody else gets this amazing.

3147
02:53:04.060 --> 02:53:07.660
It's really beautiful.
And if you a fan of human folly,

3148
02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:11.850
like I'm a big fan of folly.
I love when people fuck up.
I just,

3149
02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:15.520
not necessarily that I want people to fuck up.
I just love,

3150
02:53:15.610 --> 02:53:18.730
I love like clear,

3151
02:53:19.270 --> 02:53:23.440
undeniable craziness like that kind of stuff.
Like seeing Tom Cruise,

3152
02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:27.040
standing on a podium with this fucking gold metal,

3153
02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:31.660
talking to that guy saying,
I've never met a man more honorable,
more noble,

3154
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:37.720
or in saluting.
We tell on h we did it as I was watching,

3155
02:53:37.721 --> 02:53:41.620
it almost seemed like a movie clip to me.
Like he was in character.

3156
02:53:41.621 --> 02:53:45.160
I was watching it being like,
this is real.
They like it really had this,

3157
02:53:45.161 --> 02:53:49.120
this wasn't,
that guy's amazing.
Tom Cruise's.
Amazing.

3158
02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:53.500
Amazing in that he's just so,
first of all,
brilliant actor,

3159
02:53:53.770 --> 02:53:57.190
but just so Goddamn wacky off the charts wacky,

3160
02:53:57.640 --> 02:53:59.620
but you've covered that perfect on the podcast.

3161
02:53:59.621 --> 02:54:04.180
I couldn't agree more where when you become really famous world,

3162
02:54:04.181 --> 02:54:05.620
famous to where like you know,

3163
02:54:05.621 --> 02:54:08.380
nine out of 10 people know your name and you just have yes.

3164
02:54:08.381 --> 02:54:10.960
How about her tenant at the time,
Tom Cruise?
It might be like,

3165
02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:16.390
it might be more than I'd be nine 9.8 it's like 999 out of 100 at the very

3166
02:54:16.450 --> 02:54:20.710
least,
right?
Yeah,
I would say so.
You just have nothing but yes.

3167
02:54:20.711 --> 02:54:22.600
Men saying everything you did.

3168
02:54:22.601 --> 02:54:25.720
Like you come up with an idea that's clearly crazy as you're saying,

3169
02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:29.530
a ridiculous,
but everyone around you doesn't want to get you upset or get fired,

3170
02:54:29.531 --> 02:54:31.780
so they're like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's great.
That's brilliant.

3171
02:54:31.781 --> 02:54:32.860
You can save the world.

3172
02:54:32.861 --> 02:54:37.330
You are when you like a Tom cruise and you're like literally 999 out of a

3173
02:54:37.330 --> 02:54:39.640
thousand people know who the fuck you are.
Like Wah,
Wah.

3174
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:42.850
It's probably more than that,
right?
Do we think it's more than that?

3175
02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:47.440
I would say out of 100,000 people,
three don't know Tom Cruises.

3176
02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:50.260
I would really be willing to sign that.
I'd put money on that.

3177
02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:53.950
Then maybe 10 maybe 10 and maybe little kids,

3178
02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:59.160
but adults from 18 on let's go from 18 it's like so close to 100% know who he

3179
02:54:59.891 --> 02:55:03.960
is.
Yeah,
it's so close I think.
Well you know I had dom on the podcast has,

3180
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:07.580
<v 2>he's friends with Cher and he used to open up for share all the time and share</v>

3181
02:55:07.610 --> 02:55:11.240
without,
she's been famous since she was 19 and she would ask him questions like,

3182
02:55:11.241 --> 02:55:13.910
what's it like out there?
What's low?
What's it like?

3183
02:55:13.911 --> 02:55:16.670
What do people like like well what's it like to go to the movies?

3184
02:55:16.850 --> 02:55:19.700
And he like made her like come out with them in Montreal.
He's like,

3185
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:21.320
what'd he say?
He said,

3186
02:55:21.321 --> 02:55:24.320
leave the top hat and cane at home and just call it outside.

3187
02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:28.100
And then she's just so weirded out by people because she's been famous for so

3188
02:55:28.101 --> 02:55:32.960
long that she's completely alienated and I think Tom Cruise is very similar that

3189
02:55:32.961 --> 02:55:36.380
he's been a movie star since the wanderers.
Like what year was that?

3190
02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:39.170
The outsiders?
Outsiders.

3191
02:55:39.270 --> 02:55:41.960
That's like 81 or something like that,

3192
02:55:41.961 --> 02:55:45.620
I want to say and made something incredibly long ago.
What was it,

3193
02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:50.540
83 three so a 1983 he's been a fucking huge star since,

3194
02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:55.520
I mean that's insane.
It says 32 years,

3195
02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:59.600
is that right?
How was that possible?
32 years.
It looks exactly the same.

3196
02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:03.770
He's a fucking vampire.
That's what he,
he's in good shape.

3197
02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:08.300
How old is he?
He's like 51 or something.
It looks great.

3198
02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:10.520
It looks a little worn out in the Cameron Diaz movie,

3199
02:56:10.521 --> 02:56:13.430
but do a movie with Cameron Diaz.
How?
See how you turn out?

3200
02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:18.740
52 hands of bastard,
but look at this

3201
02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.160
in with the fucking metal with a giant.
The giant sign.
The glow behind them.

3202
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.861
What's what?
All of them.

3203
02:56:27.861 --> 02:56:30.440
I don't get what's with all of them wearing like the military outfits,

3204
02:56:30.441 --> 02:56:33.410
like with the badges,
like they won,
they went to war.
They,

3205
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:38.360
their word against Xenu,
they'd beat Xenu.
Oh,
oh fuck.
Oh look,

3206
02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:42.570
how's he knew
I just,
I,
I'm a,

3207
02:56:42.670 --> 02:56:46.340
it's just a really big fan of wacky people like that.
They're so over the top,

3208
02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:50.960
but yet so undeniably successful and so brilliant at what they do.

3209
02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:54.410
What's that movie tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow.
The edge of tomorrow.

3210
02:56:54.470 --> 02:56:56.960
Edge of tomorrow.
Is that what it is?
I really loved that movie.

3211
02:56:56.961 --> 02:56:59.420
So the recent recent side of science fiction movie bombed only.

3212
02:56:59.421 --> 02:57:02.600
I thought it was a bomb rates.
Yeah,
they didn't do well.
Really?
Yeah.

3213
02:57:02.601 --> 02:57:05.990
It didn't make probably all of his wackiness the wackiness is probably catching

3214
02:57:05.991 --> 02:57:08.730
up.
Oh,
I think so.
I mean,
it might've,

3215
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:11.870
I'd heard that just it's opening month was not good.
Right.

3216
02:57:11.871 --> 02:57:16.040
They were not what they are expecting.
But when you watch a movie,
I agree.
I like,

3217
02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:16.521
really,

3218
02:57:16.521 --> 02:57:19.010
I remember thinking that was one of the best movies that came out that summer.

3219
02:57:19.011 --> 02:57:23.540
It was a really good story.
Is Very unique,
the way the aliens was very different.

3220
02:57:23.541 --> 02:57:27.840
And like the concept of redoing the day,
I thought it was great.
I really know.

3221
02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:29.960
Did it not do well?
Well,

3222
02:57:29.961 --> 02:57:34.961
I know he experienced a big drop in his popularity or the p the way people

3223
02:57:35.211 --> 02:57:38.630
respected him after he did that dot.
That a interview with Blackpearl hour.

3224
02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:40.970
I thought it was the Oprah went crazy on the couch.

3225
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:45.910
Chicks loved that and I'm in love.
Please.
Yeah,
that was not,

3226
02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:50.600
that was not how it man ever behaves when he's in love ever.

3227
02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:56.540
That is a guy who loves Dick Italian to be in love with a chick and he's got a

3228
02:57:56.601 --> 02:58:01.200
whole team of people covering up for the fact that he loves Dick.
But um,
no,

3229
02:58:01.201 --> 02:58:04.590
he did that.
Matt Lauer one where he's getting on Brooke.

3230
02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:07.840
Brooke shields for being on antidepressants.
That's right.
That's right.

3231
02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:11.970
You can just correct it with exercise and when you can help it.
But I mean,

3232
02:58:11.971 --> 02:58:15.510
the idea that you,
you understand what's going on in her brain,
like,
I'm sorry,

3233
02:58:15.511 --> 02:58:17.020
dude,
what kind of research have you done?
Yeah.

3234
02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:20.070
Especially what kind of tests have you run it on?
Brooke in particular,

3235
02:58:20.071 --> 02:58:22.980
but he's gone but he's cold trickle so he knows what's up.
Right.
It's cold.

3236
02:58:22.981 --> 02:58:27.210
Trickle days was under cold Turkey.
I don't know how you remember that.

3237
02:58:27.211 --> 02:58:31.870
I remember him from top gun.
That is a big one too.
All right,

Thank you very much.
Are you putting together two fucking amazing documentaries?

3240
02:58:37.921 --> 02:58:41.850
