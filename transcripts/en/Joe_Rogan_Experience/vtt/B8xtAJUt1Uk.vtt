<v Speaker 1>Drive by day,</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night,</v>

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.043
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

4
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

5
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>

6
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.541
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

7
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And then he can't lie to me.</v>

8
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you're going to lie to me about because if you lie to me,</v>

9
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna see you on Monday,</v>

10
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.534
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

11
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to see what you're made of.</v>

12
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You'll know anyway.</v>

13
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>without even knowing what they're made of,</v>

15
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll know their mind.</v>

16
00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's different when you fight somebody,</v>

17
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you literally know what they're made of.</v>

18
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>When you see the look in their eye and they say what they say and they do what</v>

19
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>they do and then they go and they fight and they don't say what they say and</v>

20
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>they don't do what they do.</v>

21
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's just fighting.</v>

22
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's so refreshing about it to me.</v>

23
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Well the psychological aspect of it,</v>

25
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:38.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>who was it that said this fighting is 90% mental and the other 10% in your head?</v>

29
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I forget who said that.</v>

30
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.201
<v Speaker 1>I remember either,</v>

31
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard it.</v>

32
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a great quote.</v>

33
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember who said it,</v>

34
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's,</v>

35
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I believe it with all my heart.</v>

36
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people out there,</v>

37
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>there's so incredibly physically talented.</v>

38
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And how many gym assassins do you know that for whatever reason they just can't</v>

39
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>put it together when the referee says are fine or are you ready,</v>

40
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>finery ready go.</v>

41
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>They just are a fraction of who they really are.</v>

42
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Just really break down and think about what happens to the ones that do make it</v>

43
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>and then have to deal with the media and uh,</v>

44
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

45
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>And I really feel like athletes,</v>

46
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>the biggest hurdle is effect.</v>

47
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>That we're willing to actually just get up there and say we might,</v>

48
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>when we might lose.</v>

49
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>And just put that out there and say,</v>

50
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.613
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to,</v>

51
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>to put yourself out there like that.</v>

52
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to embarrass yourself if you do lose?</v>

53
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to deal with the media?</v>

54
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:42.081
<v Speaker 1>If you win for 10 years straight and then lose and then now you're the worst guy</v>

55
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been seen in the sport or the worst female that's ever been seen the</v>

56
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>sport you didn't even belong.</v>

57
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.114
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

58
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>are you able to deal with that?</v>

59
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

60
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what being an athlete is not.</v>

61
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Well those would be an fighter being different strains to basketball game.</v>

62
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

63
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>You lose a basketball game and people might think you're a fucking loser or a</v>

64
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:00.751
<v Speaker 1>scrub,</v>

65
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing like the shit that I see fighters face online.</v>

66
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.741
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

67
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:04.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>just look at,</v>

69
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I gotta bring Ronda Rousey up because it's heartbreaking for me as an athlete.</v>

70
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I know what she's feeling,</v>

71
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I know what she's going through.</v>

72
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

73
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>as a female it's even on another level,</v>

74
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't really imagine that.</v>

75
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.471
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

76
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a different level of scrutiny I would imagine.</v>

77
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

78
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.691
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

79
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it shows how hard it is to deal with this man,</v>

80
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

81
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>the ups and downs because the downs hit hard just as hard as it hit and you</v>

82
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>gotta be ready and there can't be any separation and who you are with a win and</v>

83
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:38.371
<v Speaker 1>a loss.</v>

84
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:39.121
<v Speaker 1>Because if there is,</v>

85
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shell and you gotta be who you are and not be solely connected to</v>

86
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>fighting as your whole being.</v>

87
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're over when,</v>

88
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>

89
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.713
<v Speaker 1>when it ends,</v>

90
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

91
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>There was something about the Ronda Rousey promos that I always felt like I</v>

92
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.373
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

93
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like hearing it.</v>

94
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Like she was like,</v>

95
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get back to fighting because it's the most important thing and it's a</v>

96
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>thing that I can be best in the world.</v>

97
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

98
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

99
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I actually like hearing that studio.</v>

100
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.251
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

101
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is,</v>

102
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>it's such a lesson if you really listening in between the lines to the issue of</v>

103
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.564
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

104
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's just my opinion.</v>

105
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>We're all putting so much into this one thing and we think that that is our</v>

106
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 1>everything when really if she,</v>

107
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

108
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

109
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>it sounds cheesy,</v>

110
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you put all that energy towards loving yourself and not the fight career,</v>

111
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the fight career will still be there just as heavy as it is.</v>

112
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

113
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.521
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

114
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean is she's using the fighting as her identity with that</v>

115
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>championship belt.</v>

116
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>She is Ronda Rousey,</v>

117
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>the Ronda Rousey without the championship belt.</v>

118
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who she is.</v>

119
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>She won't come out.</v>

120
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>So who are you?</v>

121
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're winning.</v>

122
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.201
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

123
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.034
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

124
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>You're counting on that belt to know who you are now?</v>

125
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

126
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>that was my biggest point.</v>

127
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>That was a hurdle I ran into when I lost my belt.</v>

128
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who I was anymore,</v>

129
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's how I knew this.</v>

130
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's how I figured out what my issues were.</v>

131
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
