00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast my night day.</v>

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets real tricky when someone does</v>

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 2>denies the rights of citizens than</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's empowered.</v>

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Denies the rights because w what are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're in power and you're denying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights,</v>

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you step in and deny people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do processed,</v>

7
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 2>deny people lawyers to die people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever want to do that?</v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a real question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when things get passed,</v>

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 2>like the National Defense Authorization</v>
<v Speaker 2>Act allows the government to</v>

10
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 2>indefinitely detained American civilians</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have to do anything.</v>

11
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>They're not required to notify your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 2>They're not required to arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not required to.</v>

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

14
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can just lock you up when you see</v>

15
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that drive you crazy?</v>

16
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people always say to me,</v>

17
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.094
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

18
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you defending the terrorist?</v>

19
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 3>And what you try to explain to people is</v>
<v Speaker 3>without the due process,</v>

20
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 3>there's no confirmation that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist.</v>

21
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 3>The only way you know it's a terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when some court somewhere determines</v>

22
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 3>upon looking at the evidence that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>person is a terrorist.</v>

23
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 3>Once you can kill somebody on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicion of being a terrorist,</v>

24
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all under suspicion of terrorist</v>

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 3>under the certain conditions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone wants to deem a mistaken</v>

26
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 3>identity situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

27
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Or I mean how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many guys are named Omar or Mohammad</v>

28
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 3>or you know what I mean?</v>

29
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about in this dorm or case the,</v>

30
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>the cop shot up two different cars that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the wrong cards.</v>

31
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>

32
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 2>You the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the government should have</v>

33
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 2>special powers that regular human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

34
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

35
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have that now.</v>

36
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they already do because</v>

37
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it to the next level and decide</v>

38
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to deny the rights of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you feel are guilty.</v>

39
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you and how do I know that</v>

40
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 2>you're infallible and how do I know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't corruption?</v>

41
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>How do I know this isn't a personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>grudge?</v>

42
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're dealing with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization that has a spotless record</v>

43
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>over the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 2>200 years where they're the most ethical</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings to ever exist.</v>

45
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 2>And people from other countries come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for,</v>

46
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've caught them a lie,</v>

47
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 2>but $1 million.</v>

48
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had could.</v>

49
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 3>We had a committee hearings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you cannot even imagine today,</v>

50
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 3>which shows you how much things have</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>

51
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 3>In the 1970s we had the church committee</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearings in the Pike Committee hearings</v>

52
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 3>where the government actually on</v>
<v Speaker 3>television exposed everything the CIA</v>

53
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 3>had been doing since the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second World War.</v>

54
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 3>The assassinations and all this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

55
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 3>The crown jewels are what the CIA used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to call those secrets that were exposed</v>

56
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 3>on television by congressional and</v>
<v Speaker 3>senatorial committees.</v>

57
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 3>It just shows you what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no oversight and if stuff is too</v>

58
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 3>secret to have oversight over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking for trouble.</v>

59
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 3>There's too many ways human beings can</v>
<v Speaker 3>justify going beyond the rules,</v>

60
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 3>and there's always a good reason and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear it today.</v>

61
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the waterboarding thing.</v>

62
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 3>As a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for</v>

63
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 3>having an attitude that we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

64
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're terrorists and you can save</v>

65
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 3>lives by torturing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that an ethical dilemma where it's</v>

66
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 3>worth torturing some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

67
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 3>is bad anyway in order to save lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 3>if you could have prevented the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>towers from falling down by</v>

69
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 3>waterboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of bad guys,</v>

70
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 3>isn't that worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that those ethical dilemmas lead you</v>

71
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 3>off into the weeds really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And history shows that over and over</v>

72
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

73
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very doubtful that it's helping</v>

74
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:24.080
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very doubtful that you're really</v>

75
00:03:24.081 --> 00:03:27.320
<v Speaker 2>getting that kind of key information</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people by throwing water down their</v>

76
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.410
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:29.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

78
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if if torturing people gets</v>

79
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 2>them to tell the truth,</v>

80
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.870
<v Speaker 3>gets him to tell you anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an old line about,</v>

81
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.910
<v Speaker 3>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wish I could quote it at length.</v>

82
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonderful line going back</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years where somebody says,</v>

83
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.060
<v Speaker 3>would you abrogate the laws in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the devil?</v>

84
00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 3>And the other guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

85
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would stick to the laws because if,</v>

86
00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Speaker 3>if you abrogate the laws to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>devil,</v>

87
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:53.090
<v Speaker 3>you take away the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>protects yourself eventually.</v>

88
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>

89
00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:56.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to go after this to get to</v>

90
00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:58.550
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think one that it'll stay</v>

91
00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:01.520
<v Speaker 3>with terrorists and to that what a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist is,</v>

92
00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 3>that definition won't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Bush administration was calling</v>

93
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 3>these people that would light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

94
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 3>car dealerships on fire in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the night when there was no one there.</v>

95
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Ecoterrorists you're going to drone</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>

96
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

97
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>When are you going to do exactly where</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the line get drawn and who gets to</v>

98
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

99
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.100
<v Speaker 3>antifungal coffee proponents that might</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a little hyped up,</v>

100
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 3>but those motherfuckers grown those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

101
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean do this whole fucking pope thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me it's crazy,</v>

102
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 3>crazy and hilarious that we even pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to what that clown is doing.</v>

103
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 3>How is that even making the news?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some weird fucking group of</v>

104
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 3>people who do like the most bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>ceremonies who I,</v>

105
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't sanctioned sanctioned</v>

106
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>governments and mass media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one calls it a call.</v>

107
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 2>The guy's wearing a fucking wizard out</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet with a fish head hat.</v>

108
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.560
<v Speaker 2>It's if you tried to do that today and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to say,</v>

109
00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I am a Dorn of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has brought to me this information.</v>

110
00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>He tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you set up a shop,</v>

111
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.760
<v Speaker 2>they would think you are a fucking loon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of the fact that it's been</v>

112
00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:58.280
<v Speaker 2>around for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has a direct lineage.</v>

113
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to take it serious.</v>

114
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to take it seriously and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to fucking ignore all the</v>

115
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Shit Catholicism did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

116
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:05.570
<v Speaker 3>how about this shit here</v>

117
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>did he released a priest that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>molested 200 deaf boys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>brought him into psychiatric instead of</v>

120
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 2>bringing in and getting them prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought him in for psychiatric</v>

<v Speaker 2>treatment and this guy went on to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He did that time and time again.</v>

124
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 2>He took people away from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecuted and sent him to psychiatric</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're free to go.</v>

126
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 2>They're free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're walking around the streets.</v>

127
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are in these huge religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>retreat places that they have beautiful</v>

128
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 2>grounds and these guys are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around taking care of for the</v>

129
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>rest of their lives and the trauma.</v>

130
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a place like that up by where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

131
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:46.451
<v Speaker 3>Where?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

133

<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's happening and they don't pay</v>

134
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't pay fucking taxes.</v>

135
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 3>That is is</v>

136
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that shit is crazy.</v>

137
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make golden buildings and not pay taxes.</v>

138
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>

139
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Can you fucking imagine that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

140
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking business.</v>

141
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.481
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

142
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk directly directly for</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

143
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 2>It's 2013 stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop your bullshit.</v>

144
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 2>You're not telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that much.</v>

145
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you are very charismatic and</v>

146
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe you and they'll go along with</v>

147
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're talking crazy to God's not</v>

148
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>talking to you stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

149
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an asshole and you,</v>

150
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you'd taken their money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've got to make sure that this</v>

151
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>stops with our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to make sure that future</v>

152
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 2>generations don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a gigantic religious</v>

153
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who tells them based on some</v>

154
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>nutty shit that was written thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago by people drew on animal</v>

155
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 2>skins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 3>So it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it spreads that the way that looks with</v>

157
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism is just one version of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

158
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.720
<v Speaker 3>The other problem is the guy who calls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

159
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>there's like an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the way there was a pope,</v>

160
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.380
<v Speaker 3>there's also a dude who calls himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

161
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 3>but instead of representing some</v>
<v Speaker 3>phantasmo forest called God,</v>

162
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I represent the will of the people.</v>

163
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Yet he doesn't really represent the well</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people.</v>

164
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.060
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like that when he goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to when,</v>

165
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they do the polls and that fine as</v>

166
00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:16.660
<v Speaker 3>it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not just the present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course the government as a whole,</v>

168
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.070
<v Speaker 3>the president doesn't have to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alterian power,</v>

169
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that the president</v>
<v Speaker 3>really represents the will of the</v>

170
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:25.960
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think Congress represents</v>

171
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 3>the will of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think Senate represents the</v>

172
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 3>will of the people any more than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pope represents the will of God.</v>

173
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this imaginary thing that we're supposed</v>

174
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 3>to believe in because it makes us feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>more comfortable as those,</v>

175
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 3>these people are really enacting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>will of the people.</v>

176
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I think the will of the people is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want peace.</v>

177
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 3>We want to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

178
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 3>we do want security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want education,</v>

179
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.230
<v Speaker 3>but we don't want fucking war with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

180
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.530
<v Speaker 3>we don't want fucking war with Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>

181
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you say?</v>

182
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 3>And I forget to say that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so start up,</v>

183
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.410
<v Speaker 3>we don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants war.</v>

184
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a small faction of people,</v>

185
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 3>sweaty red face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cocksuckers</v>

186
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.910

<v Speaker 2>palisades parkway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pull him over and his 2005</v>

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Mitsubishi Lancer and he's acting real</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

206
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they decided to bring him in.</v>

207
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>So they bring him in and they opened up</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ass.</v>

208
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 2>They just gave him a cavity check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy didn't do anything wrong</v>

209
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and they pulled him over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just looked weird.</v>

210
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>He was tweaking out on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something was going on with the man.</v>

211
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>He was pulled over.</v>

212
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>routine traffic stop.</v>

213
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they detected the smell of marijuana and</v>

214
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

215
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>that's where they got them and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought him in because they smelled</v>

216
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

217
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>And he had a hundred bags of heroin up</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ass.</v>

218
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>And you can't put a hundred bags of</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin up your ass while the cops are</v>

219
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 2>going from their car to your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

220
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So he was driving around with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed up.</v>

221
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you drive around and smoke</v>

222
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>weed with a hundred packs of heroin in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ass?</v>

223
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just one of those guys.</v>

224
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.073
<v Speaker 2>That's his move.</v>

225
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.333
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's like,</v>

226
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>like Russian chicks would put ben Wa</v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and their pussy to tighten up</v>

227
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 2>their must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fuck muscle.</v>

228
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this dude was just like exercise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>

229
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 2>his ass story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starfish,</v>

230
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 2>starfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he didn't trust his roommate's</v>

231
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:01.831
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

232
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 2>if I leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a hundred bags of heroin.</v>

233
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 4>Well these motherfuckers to get itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to the gym.</v>

234

<v Speaker 4>I can't leave.</v>

236
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.560
<v Speaker 4>I can't leave it in my dash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's work on that star fish.</v>

237
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 2>The glove box is full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

238
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I just stuffed this up my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

239
00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Can I fit a hundred bags?</v>

243
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Steven Greer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know who Dr. Greer is,</v>

244
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of that came out was at 20 2011,</v>

245
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.310
<v Speaker 2>the disclosure project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it 2001 2011.</v>

246
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:45.710

<v Speaker 2>11th,</v>

247
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the 11 came from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

248
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a huge,</v>

250
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Internet,</v>

251
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.110
<v Speaker 2>a huge point of controversy and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a topic of conversation.</v>

252
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 2>It was you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.480
<v Speaker 2>on stage introducing this disclosure</v>
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>

254
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>explaining how much information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.730
<v Speaker 2>access to about alien spacecrafts</v>
<v Speaker 2>visiting earth and how many</v>

257
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:14.000
<v Speaker 2>distinguished high ranking military</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

258
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.550
<v Speaker 2>And that was where it got shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 2>agreed with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

260
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:17.681
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

261
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:20.200
<v Speaker 5>one of the interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after we put this briefing together for</v>

262
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Clinton and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

263
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Laurance Rockefeller,</v>

264
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put the concept together,</v>

265
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 5>the best available evidence and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these cases,</v>

266
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 5>and then Lawrence Rockefeller hosted a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill and Hillary Clinton at the</v>

267
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Rockefeller ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that it had me out there shortly</v>

268
00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:39.700
<v Speaker 5>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Mr Rockefeller was the white hat in</v>

269
00:11:39.701 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 5>the family who wanted to end the</v>
<v Speaker 5>secrecy,</v>

270
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.350
<v Speaker 5>unlike some of his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his family.</v>

271
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.541
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

272
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 5>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he said to me one night,</v>

273
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 5>I was at on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on his porch,</v>

274
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 5>on a deck in the grand tetons at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] ranch,</v>

275
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

276
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we really need you to hurry up and do</v>

277
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

278
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.071
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence,</v>

279
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm just a doctor in North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm working in an er,</v>

280
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

281
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.571
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

282
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:05.381
<v Speaker 5>you have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

283
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:06.011
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence,</v>

284
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 5>you have to get these guys to do.</v>

285
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will never do it.</v>

286
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.881
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence,</v>

287
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 5>for God's sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're old,</v>

288
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 5>you're rich and you're rockefeller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

289
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:14.141
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

290
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 5>the implications of this are so vast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so profound that no aspect of life</v>

291
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 5>will be unchanged when it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

292
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:21.761
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence,</v>

293
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 5>that's why it's secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he said to me,</v>

294
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means those folks aren't going to</v>

295
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.484
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

296
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before that,</v>

297
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 5>as shortly after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I had this,</v>

298
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meeting with the CIA director and,</v>

299
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the president's friends came</v>

300
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 5>to my house and this was a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbing story.</v>

301
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting at the table with my four</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

302
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 5>four daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this man who's very close friends</v>

303
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 5>with the president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

304
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Clinton says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

305
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.941
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

306
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:54.330
<v Speaker 5>they're very supportive of what you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>recommended in this white patriarch.</v>

307
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.213
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

308
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not going to do it.</v>

309
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

310
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're convinced that if the president</v>

311
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 5>steps into this too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll end up like Jack Kennedy.</v>

312
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 5>And I started laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

313
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 5>what a load of nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he stopped me.</v>

314
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:11.501
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

315
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 5>they're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

316
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't say this in front of the kids.</v>

317
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 5>So we went to the library in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

318
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 5>after dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>

319
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about Kevin?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

320
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 5>they really think this is too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

321
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what am I supposed to do?</v>

322
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 5>What am I chop liver?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he looked at me and he says,</v>

323
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're expendable.</v>

324
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 5>So I've always viewed myself as the kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the throwaway guy and all of this.</v>

325
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the sense that these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

326
00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the folks who have enormous political</v>

327
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:40.130
<v Speaker 5>power and corporate power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

328
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 5>even the ones who support this very</v>
<v Speaker 5>avidly,</v>

329
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 5>and there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

330
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to stick their necks</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

331
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 5>but I'm confused.</v>

332
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill</v>

333
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 5>Clinton came out and said that we may</v>
<v Speaker 5>have evidence that there might be some</v>

334
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 5>intelligent life out there in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>or universe?</v>

335
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:57.160
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

336
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 5>it's like the rem song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the end of the world as we know it.</v>

337
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Because if that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that happens when that happens,</v>

338
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.050
<v Speaker 5>people would panic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

339
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.401
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

340
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:05.651
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

341
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The public isn't going to panic over</v>

342
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 5>this unless it's couched in a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

343
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the public definitely will panic if the</v>

344
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 5>president comes out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ufo is,</v>

345
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 5>and then he gets whacked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would lead to panic.</v>

346
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a bigger problem if the</v>

347
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 5>president doesn't have control access</v>
<v Speaker 5>over these projects.</v>

348
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want to talk about it because</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it shows the fact that our</v>

349
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:29.851
<v Speaker 5>democracy has been side lined as</v>
<v Speaker 5>eisenhower warned us experience</v>

350
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.560
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible].</v>
