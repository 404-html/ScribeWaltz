64
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.220

It's not a law firm.
It's a lawyer's secretary.

65
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.030
It's a machine.
You're pressing keys.
There's no one on the other end.

78
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.060
That's like the worst fucking useless voice.

79
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.070
That's a cliche ever is this sexy phone girl because no one thinks that sexy.

80
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.330
Like if a girl is talking to you like,

81
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.280
like that's what kind of closeness.

82
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.940
1958 is that disaster on the other end talking to you.

83
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.100
She's cutting her nails.

84
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.760
The only one that's the other one that's like it is the the scary voice.

85
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.260
Welcome to my home.
That's not scary.
Fucking Dracula.

86
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.310
That's not scary.
That's like Sitcom Dracula.

87
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.470
Tonight will be a very special spatial creepy show.
That's a sesame street.

and congratulations young man by one of my favorite.

104
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.560
There's like you and Chris Harris on my two favorite Internet journalists

105
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.310
because you're both like regular dudes who fucking really love cars.

106
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.770
He's not a regular dude.
He's a maniac.
He's a maniac.

107
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.130
He's a fucking crazier than you.
He's way crazy,
way crazy the way it drives.

108
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.260
But what you would,
you guys are,

109
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:44.261
is like people to have a real passion for automotive engineering and design and

110
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.140
the history behind it.
And the kind of car is like,
you're a fucking car nut dude.

111
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.380
Like world.
A lot of things to appreciate it.
You were on the,
uh,
the road today.

112
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.290
One of the things I thought was fascinating was cars would drive by like,
ah,

113
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:57.210
84 supra.
Look at that.
You hit the back of your head.
The one,

114
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.180
like you had all these every fucking car,

115
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:03.300
like you're a legit a hundred percent car nuts.
Yeah.
I'm,

116
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.610
I pale in comparison.
I was a fan,
wasn't he?
Was he felt like I was a fan.

117
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.850
He had a rollbar.
Yeah.
That guy was fun track day,
Bro.
He was,
he was funny.

118
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.040
He turned around and came back just to see what the fuck was up.

119
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.780
Well we did have some metal.
Yeah,
there was some metal out there,
some fine cars.

120
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.970
Alex is and a,
and James were built us.
So Alex,
Alex is the guy who,

121
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:27.060
um,
did you find a shark works?
You have a founder of it too,
right?

122
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.360
You don't find,
you say created and now he felt,
he founded find it.

123
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.890
Someone found it just so happened to have your nickname as the name of the

124
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.840
company.
Sharkey coincidence.
That's great.
I figured why not fuck it.

125
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.780
This is a sign from God.
Yeah.

126
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.470
I've just found this thing and this is what I love to do.
Anyway,

127
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.010
I happened to find this tuner company called sharper and this to the company

128
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.820
takes,
couldn't even spell it correctly.
So everybody looked for like,
oh,

129
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.430
and there's no,
Oh,
what is this works Sherman,
you assholes.
Seven cars.

130
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.200
I get it.
I get it.
I get it.
Or they're being crafty.

131
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.300
It's like comedy with a k when it's comedy night.
Kooky comedy.
Okay.
Okay.

132
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.600
Like a morning zoo,
like the Kooky comedy club.
KKK.
Yes.

133
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.540
It exists somewhere.
Probably.
If it doesn't,
it will.

134
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.370
All things will happen eventually.

135
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:13.100
It's at least going to be a Twitter handle in the next few days for sure.

136
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.790
Because that's a fucking few minutes probably jumping on it right now.

137
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:21.560
Trying to figure it out or we live.
Oh,
we are.
Okay.
Yeah.
Um,
so,
uh,
Alex,

138
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:21.920
uh,

139
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.920
builds cars and what he does is he takes what's arguably the greatest race car

140
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.240
for the street in the world,

141
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.270
which is a Porsche gt three and he turns them into these ridiculous gt three Cs.

142
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.170
She t three is on performance enhancing drugs,

143
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.740
EPO and all those Lance Armstrong Chemicals.
It's fucking,

144
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.500
cars are just completely different animals,
man.
They're fucking fun.

145
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.750
Really Loud and interesting and,
and you know,
you just pull out,

146
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.600
I'm a little,
you know,
you,
you find the part she like,
like the,

147
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.460
the high revving nature,
the,

148
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.130
the steering and the whole delivery,

149
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.640
the way the power comes on and just builds and builds and you just pull that

150
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:00.600
down a little more.
You know,

151
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:05.340
you're soaking up the existing character of the car rather than try and turn it

152
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.680
into something else.
What year did the car get invented?

153
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.010
What was the first Henry Ford Automobile?
19 Oh,

154
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.650
the car car.
Car First car,
which are hundreds.

155
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:21.270
They 1818.
There's a French human silver who did it actually first.

156
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.710
But like there was a bunch of people thinking about 80,
70,
80.

157
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.540
It was the first like Trump,
you know,
a little fucking carts.

158
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.470
They just didn't have a horse pulling them.
But that's basically what they are.

159
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.400
So on the long shot,
we're dealing with 130 years,
would you say?

160
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.960
Yeah,
on the short,
maybe just a couple of years less than,
yeah,
that's uh,

161
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.550
not that much time to figure shit out.
No.
But we were just talking,

162
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.380
Alex and I were talking today about the old Porsche's,

163
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.220
like those 1970s models with the big wooden steering wheel and the skinny ass

164
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:54.180
tires and race them.
It's like they must've been kind of their mind.

165
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.490
They're crazy.
They were young,
knows you go,
uh,
you know,

166
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:01.491
every year they have the historic races and there they raced this shit from like

167
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.210
1915,
you know,
these Mercer a race about sin and,

168
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.270
and they have these writing mechanics and there's no,

169
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.220
they're sitting on like fucking apple boxes.

170
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.110
There's two guys there on wooden wheels,
you know,

171
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.480
and they're racing these things in their gardens around Laguna Saker,
you know,

172
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.070
with million dollar cars.
And they're,
they're going like eight tenths somewhere.

173
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:28.071
He's got like a fucking Oregon trail wagon with the engine in it and break my,

174
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.110
what we were talking about,
which I found was really fascinating.

175
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:34.140
It was just in the past,
just 30,
40 years.

176
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.120
Look at how much things have changed in the car world and what,

177
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.110
what did we decide that,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
what was the first Porsche,

178
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:41.850
what year was it?
65

179
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.160
Porsche nine 11 first of all,
49 49 was nine.
Nice.

180
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.180
Porsche Seinfeld's got that fucking,
well,

181
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:52.140
you could go back to the 20 million or something.

182
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:56.040
Crazy estimates are like six to 8 million is Christ.
Yeah.

183
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:59.100
But you could go back to the beetle.
Rarely worry if you want it to,

184
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.350
if you went very portion.
It's just like give them a,

185
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.650
an era and go with like the 65,
nine 11 right?
Yeah.
First year.
Yeah.
Yeah.

186
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.360
Think about that.
So that's like 49 years now.

187
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.140
They release the 50th anniversary this year.

188
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.570
Released that special 50th anniversaries.
So think about that man.

189
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.330
How much that fucking car has improved 50 years.
I mean,

190
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.530
but it's a tiny little increments.
That's typical Porsche,
right?
They'll,

191
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.950
they'll take it and just go like another know,
like a ring around,
uh,

192
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.760
around a tree.
You know,
our ages and just gets a little big.

193
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.420
And I just drove the newest,
the nine 11,

194
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.980
the new nine 11 turbo s which is like crazy.
TIMEWARP fast.

195
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.340
Well,
that was what I was going to get at.
At what point?

196
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.520
We were talking about this today and I think it's a fascinating subject because

197
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.000
when you see all these Google cars driving around,
like I saw a Google,

198
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.270
one of the,
it wasn't the car that drove itself,
but it was a street thing.

199
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.020
It was driving around and filming everything and taking pictures.
No,
I was,
I was,

200
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.100
look,
I find it fascinating.
It's a felony.

201
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.580
<v 1>I find it like a something in the,</v>

202
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.420
you will be eventually Google sell it to the government.

203
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.280
There'll be the government's map teams assessing,
you know,

204
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.710
that'll be the new way to make jobs.
Listen man Bro,
it's happening to it.

205
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.930
It is demolition man is fucking happening.

206
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.610
We were talking about this today that like this is probably not going to be

207
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:15.010
around that much longer driving your own car.

208
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.390
It's probably not going to be and what we've gone from these shit boxes with

209
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.900
skinny ass tires.
It's slid all over the place.
Death traps.

210
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:26.770
He couldn't hit the brakes quick enough.
Yeah,
there was slow as fuck.

211
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.430
Terrible handling the rhinos on roller skates.

212
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.590
Each and every one of them right now,

213
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.600
what we did today driving these gt three's that you've modified going through

214
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.890
the canyons and they're just stuck to the ground like a cheetah running up a

215
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:45.280
fucking tree.
The limits of she has done,
it doesn't even make sense.

216
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.440
Cheetahs don't even have claws like that.
You had us write in his lap,
dammit.

217
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.820
Yeah.
What I thought,
you know what I mean?

218
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.890
<v 3>I think like that,
that era for Porsche was the golden era though.</v>

219
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.670
I'd say from like 2001 till 2011

220
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.240
<v 1>what do you save it to?
All these people that they're,</v>

221
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.760
they long for the air cooled days.
Everybody they,
they need,

222
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.520
<v 3>they need to,
I like the air cooled,</v>

223
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.170
but they just haven't driven these and when they do quite often actually like,

224
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.000
like I was telling you,
like Magnus Walker,
right?

225
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.800
It's obviously a renowned for air cold.

226
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.620
He said it was one of the most fun cars he'd been in,
you know?

227
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.643
<v 1>No.</v>

228
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.790
Or shut off to a really bad start with the 996 which you had and told me about.

229
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:27.770
It told us to be the funniest story about earlier,

230
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:32.240
but I'll probably shit and was a terrible car and all nine nine six is are

231
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.950
pretty shit.
I mean they are pretty shit.
And the nine nine three was pretty dope.

232
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.360
Like nine nine three turbo was a fucking epic.

233
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.040
They went from the best it could ever be.
Yeah.
So the nine,

234
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:44.730
nine six what they did,
so

235
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.760
<v 3>they were running out of money.
So those were the,
I mean they're,</v>

236
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.850
they're worth a lot because they didn't build very many.
And on the nine,
nine,

237
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.120
six I was the DOTCOM era.
That was when everyone was buying a Porsche.

238
00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:00.100
They made tons and tons of him and they switched to this rather naf engine,

239
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.560
if you will,
that had problems.
And it's just,

240
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.810
except for the turbo and then later the GT three.

241
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.040
But I know you had problems with it.

242
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.890
<v 1>Oh,
mine was drunk as shit.
But it was,
I remember the,</v>

243
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.340
the one of the reasons why God it,
because I'll never forget this cover.

244
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:14.980
It was either motor trend or road and track and it had the nine,

245
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.850
the nine three nine 11 turbo on the cover and it said,

246
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.560
sell your soul and buy this car.
Yeah.
I think like,

247
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.550
is that good?
Sell your soul.
It was motor trend.
Was that whatever it was.

248
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:29.520
I was like,
dad is God damn genius.
Yeah.
And a,

249
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:31.400
I had a friend who had a nine six Ford.

250
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.440
I remember just like stare at it and go look at that fucking dose.

251
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:40.110
Amazing curves.
We drove.
I drove your car today,
which is awesome.

252
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.350
I got out of your car and I'm just like,
okay,
that's the best thing ever.

253
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.740
And then I'd drive Alex's,
which is the newer one of your car,
you know,

254
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:51.030
4.1 liter instead of the,
and I was like,
Oh shit,
that's another,

255
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.080
that's the best.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
He freaking crazy.

256
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.580
Well you have driven to give people a,
just a little background on Matt.

257
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.860
Matt's one of my,
like I said,

258
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:05.030
favorite automotive journalists because he's a real car guy.

259
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:06.320
A guy really does enjoy cards,

260
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:09.530
but also you have a deep knowledge of the history of automobiles and how they

261
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:12.200
were created and all the different models and all this different things.

262
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:15.440
But nerd,
your guys' driven that fucking every car there is.

263
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.800
So when you drive a car and say this is the best car ever,

264
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.480
that's a totally different thing.

265
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.570
So I had the best car ever for 10 minutes for 10 whole minutes until Alex stole

266
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.870
the thunder with the new one.
Fuck the new ones.
Crazy.
I drove it to,

267
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.660
I've gotten a new one and the first thing that I said to them is,
oh my God,

268
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:34.090
this is next level.
This isn't,

269
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.250
I didn't think you can get next level and still keep that rawness,

270
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.600
but clearly you can,

271
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.070
<v 3>you know,
we tried to do sort of the same way to Porsche goes,
you know,</v>

272
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:46.450
I mean we spend a lot of time on that green one that we did in order to develop,

273
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.690
it was called Kermit cause it was green.
Funny,
but classic.
Yeah.

274
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.600
Classic Dope fucking car.

275
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.530
That's the car that got me to contact you.
I remember you saw a video.

276
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.600
My wife made that video actually.
Oh my God.
This car is,
it's

277
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.270
<v 1>just so,
so visceral.</v>

278
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.140
It's like for folks who don't appreciate automobiles and I completely
understand,

279
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.210
let me try to put it into perspective in into into way you could try to

280
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:12.440
understand why people were like,

281
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.230
maybe you live in New York and you take the subway.
You couldn't give a fuck,

282
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.850
but you're about to turn this podcast off there.

283
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.230
They're just talking about drugs and fighting again,
Joe,

284
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.940
there've been geniuses that have over the course of decades,

285
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.210
engineered,
re-engineered,
redesigned,

286
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:34.211
rethought out these metal boxes with fire inside of them,

287
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:40.070
better making controlled explosions and they've got it down to a point where the

288
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:45.260
car that you just drove,
2.5 seconds,
zero to 60 in the nine 11 turbo.
Yeah.

289
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.480
What the fuck is that?
It's nuts.

290
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.190
You actually do have to sort of defy physics because the,

291
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.500
in the past you need very crazy procedures to do something like that,

292
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:02.330
like racing tires and you did drag slick.
You got to heat them up and they put,

293
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.600
they literally have put this stuff called VHT,
which is very high traction,

294
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.950
which is a spray.

295
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.120
It's like literally like you'd have to do a drag launch in glue.
Right.

296
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.440
That's what it is.
Exactly.
You know what I mean?

297
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.000
You'd have to put down a puddle of glue,
set it on fire.
Yeah.

298
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.590
And then you have to do your launch and that,

299
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.010
then they do those burnouts ended up the tires and get them really,

300
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.090
really sticky.
And so they're just being dicks.
No,
just,
well they're being asked.

301
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.320
I knew with here,
but they fucking the nine 11 turbo,

302
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.250
you just roll up to a stop sign.
Yeah.
Breast control button.

303
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.410
Left foot brake,
right foot gas,
and then you violate time and you,

304
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.430
you're breaking every law in the country in three seconds.
Three seconds.

305
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.280
Now how is this,
how is it possible that the launch control

306
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.730
<v 2>can make it that much faster with the zero to 60 if you just had it in drive and</v>

307
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:56.580
he stomped on it?
Um,
it wouldn't,
it wouldn't,

308
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:00.720
like I wouldn't hold the Rpms or build any boost.
Right.
Oh,

309
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:01.740
so the nine 11 turbo,

310
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.390
really cool because it builds boost in neutral and it's one of the very few

311
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.100
turbo engines that do that.

312
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.400
And so launch control holds the RPM at the exact optimum speed,

313
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.510
builds boost to peak and then just dumps the clutch for you versus being in

314
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:21.790
drive where it starts from neutron and goes up.

315
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.530
So how many seconds do you lose when you just do it from drive?

316
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:28.290
Say if you did it manually and you shifted gears yourself.

317
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.280
I'll have to be really honest.
I've built and driven a lot of nine,
nine,

318
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:35.180
seven turbos with loan and some nine,
nine one service.

319
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.140
And I've never launched them with the,
uh,
no.

320
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.400
I always do it with the launch control.

321
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:44.910
Really see where all the old cars that were six speeds,

322
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:47.520
you could launch them and they were actually quite hard cars to launch.

323
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.780
For folks who don't know what you're talking about.

324
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:52.470
PD K means here's the big debates lane for folks who are on the subway now
again,

325
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.820
ready to turn this fucking thing off.

326
00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:59.530
The big debate amongst people in the car world that enjoy sports cars and the

327
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:03.090
engineering of sports cars is the manual transmission,

328
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.570
which is with a third pedal or you have to press in the clutch to shift the

329
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:10.110
gears or an automatic transition.
Or as Alex had a PDK,

330
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.330
which is don't call plum Complin clunky last German.

331
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.750
You're supposed to know how to pronounce it.
I do.
You know how to do it.
Yeah.

332
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.340
Whatever it is.
Canadian Chinese,
Canadian,

333
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.400
they're ridiculous for using that chairman for Porsche double clutch.

334
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.760
It's all pull longer.
Yeah.
Something like that.

335
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:33.090
But so they call it p d k and it's just,
it's a double clutch is what it is.

336
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.390
It's clutch with a k,
it's a Kooky clutch and uh,

337
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.320
it does everything for you perfectly.

338
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:42.060
Every time I actually own one PDK car and it was the first launch car,

339
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.600
uh,
you know,
it was came out,
no eight and they even screwed up that.

340
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.250
What they did is they had these buttons,

341
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.560
I don't know if you've driven these PDK cars,
right?

342
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.730
They have these buttons right,
where you put your palms on the wheel,
right?

343
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.130
So you would,
you would be say in fourth gear,
you know,

344
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.640
and you're coming into a turn.
You want to bump it down to third,
right.

345
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:03.060
And go into second.
So you'd go into third and then as you're turning,

346
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.980
your palm would bump that stupid button and instead of being in in fourth,
sorry,

347
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:10.620
instead of being second,
you'd be in fourth gear.
That turning to specifics,

348
00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:12.720
you're just saying the gear changes around the steering wheel.
It's just,
yeah,

349
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.660
just instead of on the paddle race car,

350
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.980
they stuck with that shit.
Like glue to Porsches are very,

351
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:23.520
they're very fucking determine.
You know how to get them to get proper paddles.

352
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:26.240
Now you have to,
they there's a scam.
Yeah.

353
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.590
Standard is those dumb buttons on the wheel.

354
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:32.100
You got to spend 500 bucks on the sports steering wheel to get,

355
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.230
can they retrofit that?
Could you buy like one?
Yes.
Yes,
yes.
Okay.

356
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.660
Well that's a nice thing to know because that those buttons are jackass.

357
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.370
Bullshit,
stupid.
What?

358
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.470
That you know how else they screw you guys in America to now if it's right,

359
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.310
you know,
what did they take the ability to have any of your radio controls the,

360
00:20:50.311 --> 00:20:52.420
all these other buttons that you have on the steering wheel.

361
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.370
If you take the paddle shifter one,

362
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:57.070
they assume that you're having to concentrate so much that you're not allowed to

363
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:00.070
have any of those buttons.
So you can't answer your phone.
That though.

364
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.450
That is Kinda cool.
Steering Wheel Buttons fucking suck in a Porsche Porsche.

365
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.880
I kind of,
I don't like them in any cars,
but you,

366
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.820
you know you have them in your BMW.
Then the Cayenne,
right?

367
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.150
It's got like pubs got buttons everywhere.
That's stupid.

368
00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:16.210
I don't know what's going on.
18 buttons on the fucking steering.
It's ridiculous.

369
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.920
How many of the buttons have you pushed a button?
Push your man.

370
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.720
I'm not into that shit.

371
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.720
I think there's a certain part of me that really does look like to look in an

372
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:33.010
old,
like a 69 Mustang interior and appreciate the simplicity.

373
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.420
I appreciate like,

374
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.750
like remember when I'm Chris Harris built that nine 11 real simple green nylon

375
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.670
rally car.
Yeah.
Beautiful,
beautiful car.

376
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.060
I loved that car and I'd love to how simple he made everything.

377
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.270
The interior just had an old retro stereo.
A modern story allows us,
no,

378
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.030
no,
no.
It was a Mexico high tea.
Yeah.

379
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.440
It was one of those stick them in every vintage car.
Yeah.

380
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.760
He could have like navigation on those things.

381
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.740
It's basically an satellite radio essentially.
But I think it does Nav too.

382
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.980
You can get that kind of simplicity.
You don't have to go that old.

383
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.760
You can get anything up to like early nineties almost.

384
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.710
You can have that same,
you know,

385
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:18.550
an 89 Porsche is simple,

386
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.270
but it doesn't feel,
you don't feel like you're driving an antique.
Right,

387
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.493
right,
right.

388
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.350
Like you drive something from the 70s and you don't want to like hockey it into

389
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:31.840
a corner because you're like,
if this goes wrong,
I'm dead.

390
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.910
But late eighties you can kind of drive it harder and not be kind of,

391
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.010
that's when they started to figure it out.
Right.

392
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:41.560
With Porsche was like the nine six four they started figuring out the hand and

393
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:43.620
he really right before one,
before that.

394
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.180
Now the suspension was way improved on the nine 64 but even in that sense,

395
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.190
I mean Honda and Acura,

396
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.400
I mean the Nsx blew away at the nine six four it blew away.

397
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:56.620
The Ferrari blew her away.
Porsche.

398
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.440
I remember the first time I ever saw an Acura Nsx.

399
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.890
I was in Boston and some dude drove by with a red one and everybody's jaw

400
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:06.700
dropped to like,
oh my God.
That was a fucking the future.

401
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.400
It was.
It was incredible.

402
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:13.990
This guy pulled into Kenmore square and this fucking red space ship.

403
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:18.100
Oh my goodness.
Everybody knew it was aluminum.
It's aluminum cars.

404
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:24.280
Crazy now.
The F-150 is aluminum.
I was repeating shit that I didn't understand.

405
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.990
There's baffles in the fuel line to fuck that man.
Tell him the rods,

406
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.970
the rods,
a titanium fuel lines,
man,

407
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.910
2.8 Liter v six now the rods a titanium.
That's really important that it,

408
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.690
you know what?
That was amazing about that car.

409
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:42.160
The ACURA NSX was that it was a fucking Honda.
Yeah,
that shit was bullet proof.

410
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.040
You still see him around with hundreds of thousands of miles them.
That's

411
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.970
<v 1>why I went back to one after the Porsche.
Fuck me so hard.
Yeah,
that nine,</v>

412
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:51.650
nine six was so bad.
By the way.

413
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:55.370
This is again where people who are angry at white guys to talk about things,

414
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:58.340
they own,
they,
this is when they're tuned it off the podcast.

415
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.940
So we killed off all the people are car nuts.

416
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.620
We killed off all the people who don't like white people talking about buying

417
00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:09.950
shoes.
Ladies,
ladies,
ladies are now.
Who does that leave?
No one.

418
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.530
There's no one just that at least no one that was just an echo chamber.

419
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.350
God dammit.
But those,
uh,
Nsx is,

420
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.410
the cool thing about him was he knew that they were never going to fuck you.

421
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.370
My goes,
those things where I never had a single,
I have to Nsx is,

422
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.190
I never had a single problem.
You just change the oil,

423
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.870
check the tires and I drove them,
drove the grant and they candle.
Beautiful.

424
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.440
I don't know anyone that has one that has less than a hundred thousand miles on

425
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:36.630
it.
Yeah,
they're so great.
I still have mine.
So yeah,
Alex has one.

426
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.430
I still have my 91 NSX.

427
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.870
Fuck that car up to the space ship hybrid with fucking dual clutch transmission.

428
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:46.310
They're fucking up the whole thing.

429
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.170
So was simplicity of the original car and call it a day.
What if,

430
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.740
here's the thought.
What if Porsche or someone said,
you know what,

431
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.100
let's put out a minimalist car.
Fuck all this nonsense.

432
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.050
Let's put out a car that has no electronics at all except for this pedometer the

433
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:07.100
field.
1973 type shit.
Well you look at those old classic gauges,

434
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.980
you get limited information,
bitch.
Let's assume everything's working.

435
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.150
Get out on the fucking road and,
and concentrate on driving had transmission.

436
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.810
They had that with the nine 14 right?
And they were dog shit

437
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:20.563
dog.
Shit

438
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.860
ugly as fuck shit box.

439
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.470
It's good to put giant slicks on and Chevy engines and people care.

440
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.660
I know,
but it's,
it's light.
It's light.
It's light.

441
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.280
But it's dog shit car.

442
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.300
If they had done that with a nine nine three with a simple leather interior,

443
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:45.890
you know,
like nobody's trying to day.
We did the RS America,

444
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.420
right?
That was dog shit.
Compared to the European ones.
What's the Rs American,

445
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.330
the nine six four Geekdom,
ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.780
The nine six four is the car before the nine nine three so we're talking about

447
00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.960
like late eighties they still all look like my nine years.
That same shape.
Yeah,

448
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.220
no.
In Europe we get all the fun stuff.
We get like plastic windows,

449
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.400
we get like a roll bars,
you know a door pulls.
Yeah,

450
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:11.390
but you also have to pay like $11 a gallon for fucking gas.

451
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.190
I just drove across Europe who was in US dollars.
Well,
you know,

452
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.040
it's,
it's so weird how Porsche is so genius.
I mean,

453
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.940
their work is so genius that the cars they produce are so fucking masterful,

454
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.740
just amazing pieces of engineering.

455
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.630
But they'll stick with these dopey ass ideas like a pit bull,

456
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.940
like the dumb buttons on the fucking wheel that ever,

457
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.650
they will just talk pride man.

458
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.130
And how about the fact that they have this incredible,

459
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.600
these two incredible cars that came in and the Boxster and they fuck them but

460
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:44.040
giving them low horsepower because if

461
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.500
<v 4>they jumped him up to where the Porsche nine 11 is,</v>

462
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.230
you'd have a way better car than the nine 11 and they've got a real fucking

463
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:52.730
problem.
Alex,
how come you haven't stuck of gt three motor in a cane?

464
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.400
Well,
it's the best car ever.
I drove one ones.
No,

465
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.140
they came in is with a gt three.
And who has won a guy in New York?

466
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:05.460
I had one who who's your dad?
A company called Fahrmbacher.

467
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:09.870
Lols did it?
Yeah.
You don't want to Google that name right there.

468
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.520
Their ex uh,
owner Greg lols just got sentenced to,
was it a,

469
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.630
was it a 10 because he rubbed the church 10 years.

470
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:22.040
So you've got he robbed at Church.
Pretty dazzled.
Every four.

471
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.930
Why does it have to be him?
I don't get be our savior.
His,
her ob one,

472
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.100
his head tech who actually built that car has his own shop in New York now.
Wow.

473
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.280
His head Tech Holla at me,
dude,
let's make great.
I'll look it up.

474
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.130
Let's make something real.
I think that would be the most ridiculous car ever.

475
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.220
It would a came in with a gt three engine in it.
What would that way,

476
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:44.190
what do you mean wait 3000 pounds?
It'd be 3,100 problems.

477
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.460
How about if he fucking fuck,
you'd still need to do a lot of work on the rear.

478
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:49.550
The suspension,
you know like you said Porsche right next.

479
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.640
The hamstring that came in,
the hamstring it with like crap and the new ones,

480
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:55.050
they made it a lot better.
They really,

481
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:57.980
really want to defend the nine 11 I mean they don't,
it's awesome.

482
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.350
Think about how crazy that is.
You have this incredible design,

483
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:06.060
beautiful car and you fuck it in the bud just so that you can keep your old car

484
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.500
and viable.
BMW does it too,
buddy.
Do them with which ones?

485
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.540
The one series m you know they,

486
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.600
that car has all of the m three suspension shit but in a tiny your car,

487
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.100
right than we can handle the in three.

488
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:24.420
It's cheaper than the m three and it has an engine that if you just do on the

489
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:29.100
computer it could be fast.
That an m three I'll say him dial it back.

490
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.240
So I just drove this diamond one but dynam one of them cause dining doesn't give

491
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:35.820
a fuck about the m three I liked how you said that too.

492
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.060
He don't give a fuck about the though Steve Don and don't give a fuck.

493
00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:44.740
Not a single fuck.
Oh that bitch,

494
00:28:44.741 --> 00:28:49.741
his Mama Sangal fuck was given on that day and so his should as 450 horsepower

495
00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:54.390
and halls fucking ass now is that,
that's available like right now.

496
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:57.660
You can use that from dining.
Yeah.
The gear shifting on that.

497
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.670
You did you see,

498
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.770
here's the thing with that car because the reason you,

499
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:06.540
you said you didn't like to do I live in turbo cause it doesn't come a manual.

500
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.640
I see your point.
However,

501
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.850
cars like the United 11 turbo and this dining thing are so fucking fast that if

502
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.120
you have to shift it yourself,
it's actually hard to keep up.
Yeah.
Oh,

503
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.700
is it faster you think in the gt three Rs that he made?
No,

504
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:27.120
but the gt three Rs that he made has longer gearing the

505
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.220
one m what they're putting together that there it is.
Holy Shit.

506
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:35.500
That looks awesome.
Matter of fact,
is that our picture,
I don't know.

507
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.110
It might be jalopy car and that tastes cheap as fuck.

508
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:45.190
To pick up the car 55 grand and then take it to the ground for the kit.

509
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.650
Why hold their value pretty well?
It was lower than that.

510
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:49.370
I thought for some reason I thought that was like there.

511
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.120
There were entry level $35,000 car.
It's the top of the bottom.
Yeah.

512
00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:59.410
So they make an m was the normal m that comes from BMW 330 horsepower.

513
00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:02.773
Fucking fun.

514
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.070
<v 3>Oh,
the turbo cars.
You know the hairdryers you can tune them,</v>

515
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.750
do some computer work and you can add more.

516
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:12.390
<v 4>Yeah.
So the three 30,
is that a naturally aspirated twin turbo?
Soho.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

517
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.400
That's why the other ones are so fast because the hell out of him.
Wow.

518
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.760
It's in an enormously fun card.
Right?

519
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.190
<v 3>It's crazy.
It's,
it's stupid,
stupid,
stupid fat.
Yeah.
I told you earlier,</v>

520
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:26.700
I tried to keep like on a photo shoot with like a 3.8 Rs,

521
00:30:26.701 --> 00:30:31.701
a 4.0 or s and our 4.1 I was following in a one m the journalists that was doing

522
00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:34.230
the story.
He owns one.
And uh,

523
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:38.760
I mean just trying to keep up the car was going all over the road sideways and

524
00:30:38.761 --> 00:30:42.180
uh,
you know,
I basically got all four tires bald at the end of the,

525
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.370
<v 4>really that bad ass mother fucking car,</v>

526
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.080
I think I remember there's muscle cars,
it's like an American muscle car,

527
00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:53.250
but the European version of it,
because we make everything smaller there.

528
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.310
So it took us all,
I dunno about that.

529
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.190
Not Working Muscle car EMGs are like German cars,

530
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:03.630
but this thing it's,
it's pretty nuts.

531
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.390
I can see this pretty nuts.
I love the idea.
I'm not a fucking Porsche,
but it's,

532
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.090
it's,

533
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:12.930
it's small and really fast and you know hand,

534
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.380
it kind of looks like an accordion three series,
right?

535
00:31:16.381 --> 00:31:18.600
It's kind of like squish a little bit.
Yeah.
They've,
they,

536
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.380
they sold only a limited number of them here in the u s and they immediately

537
00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:25.310
started going up top.
It's like a stubby m three.
Yeah.

538
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.400
Now they're like five to eight grand over MSRP two years.

539
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.690
It shows this fucking trend that's going on where people,

540
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.450
this minimalist trend where people are looking at all this shit on there could

541
00:31:36.451 --> 00:31:41.100
be,
I have a buddy who has a Tesla.
Yeah.
You know,
you don't have any buttons.

542
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.520
You just talk to that fucking talent.

543
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.750
What the climate you want it tell it where to go.

544
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.710
He like used it as a Google search and it has its own three g engine three g

545
00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:52.280
though,
which is whack.
They not on four g

546
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.290
LTE in that.

547
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.460
So like he can be in the car and go the black keys and then Spotify pulls up the

548
00:32:05.401 --> 00:32:09.810
black keys and the play number one boom starts playing a song like talking to my

549
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:10.644
fucking car.

550
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.920
We'll be talking to my fucking car and have no fucking Michael Knight or

551
00:32:13.921 --> 00:32:14.341
something.

552
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:16.890
But that's one of the things that I really love about the m three is they'd have

553
00:32:16.891 --> 00:32:19.950
that little dial where you can have buttons around the dial,

554
00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:23.640
one's your phone ones,
your Nav and it's super easy to get too hot.
Buttons.

555
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.390
Buttons are key.
It's real easy.
It's a much better system than the Porsche.

556
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.980
The Porsche,
you know,

557
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.720
has all everything in c set in perfect position for driving.
Without a doubt.

558
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.940
They don't want any other ergonomics.

559
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.830
They didn't even give you cup holders until 98 in the fucking night.

560
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.860
Like a carbon fiber piece.
Now you know,
it's actually nice of them.
I liked that.

561
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.200
I liked that too.
It's cool.
BMW has it to you.

562
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:51.620
Just press a button and it pops out.
Good Cup holder in.
Joe.
I was,

563
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.770
I put my coffee in it this morning and then I was pretty good.

564
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:59.720
Clip up Angeles crest and the coffee must see my corvette has the worst couple.

565
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:03.260
There's known to man,
I call it the g meter because when you turn left,

566
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.100
your beverage goes right and it just goes all over your fucking floor.

567
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.770
Your corvette.
Is it an awesome piece of machinery?
It's pretty cool.

568
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:12.560
You have a corvette that you bought when you graduated high school,
right?

569
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.840
When you still have it,
it's still still drive 30,000 miles two weeks ago.

570
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.510
So 130 no,
no,
30 30 30 30 30 hours,
right?
Yeah,

571
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.690
it's a 98 yup.
You just hit 30,000 miles.
You.
How's that possible?

572
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.850
We always literally,
there's always like shit in our house to drive.
I just like,

573
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.590
it's never been a first car.
It's always kind of what?
That's amazing.

574
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:41.580
You bought this fucking car.
You might have like one of the best 19 bodies,

575
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.000
Corvettes on the [inaudible].

576
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.080
It's a 98 not an 89 [inaudible] 98 but it's probably up there at this point.

577
00:33:48.211 --> 00:33:49.250
And so what year did you buy?

578
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:52.220
Did you buy it new in 1998 and all the stuff that he had done to it,

579
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:53.840
like the roll bar and the engine model,

580
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:59.000
all it was stock for like eight years and that was all done in Oh six and I

581
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:01.300
haven't done shit since.
It's a great car.

582
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.730
I was fine and comments are awesome because they just,
they fucking work.

583
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.540
You know what I mean?
The interiors made a shitty plastic like,
yeah.

584
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.260
And when you close the door,
it sounds like legos are rattling around in there.

585
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:12.860
You know,

586
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:17.450
it's not a nine 11 but it's got really good balance and really good power and it

587
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:20.870
just works all the time.
It's a lot like a fanny pack.

588
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:25.280
You can't give a fuck what you did.
Just kind of accept how awesome it is to you.

589
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.020
It's awesome to me.
I don't give a fuck what you see is your car right there.

590
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.410
Oh look with my fucking bipolars psycho ex girlfriend in the past,

591
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.710
Sam boom.
Don't give out any information that will give us the checks.

592
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.400
Kept the car.
Good mood.

593
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.500
Always a good cars were rarely tell you what to do.

594
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.040
No fucking hit you.
Sometimes they're like,
I need some gas.
But that's about it.

595
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.760
That's about it.
A lot.
Lot better than man.

596
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.830
Like the fanny pack of the automotive world platforms to start your built.

597
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.930
You start from a corvette,
take everything that GM cheaped out on,
which is a lot,

598
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.690
and then make that better.
And then you've got to really,
I like,

599
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.810
I like the Zr one the best.
Um,

600
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.700
like some of my customers better than they know what it is.

601
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.170
You sit in the car and you're like,

602
00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:15.620
this is a Zr one and it has a Chevy cobalt steering wheel.
Yeah.

603
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.100
But better than that.
Was that one that you drove the uh,
the race car company?

604
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:25.550
What is it?
The uh,
oh,
the Avi racing,
the tube frame core.

605
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:30.440
Now the guys who make their own body,
it's a,
it's a bit wider.
All carbon fiber.

606
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.760
The Pratt and Miller's CSRS thing.
Yeah.
Which is a crazy idea,

607
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:39.330
but sort of a sharp works situation actually.
It's pretty,
pretty close.

608
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:43.290
Yeah.
It took a great car,
the Zr one.
And they said,
you know what,

609
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.220
here's what we're going to do.

610
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.050
We're going to go with a naturally aspirated engine.

611
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:50.490
We're going to make that bitch about 600 motherfucking horsepower,
a demon.

612
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.360
He does an eight liter it up,
puts it up.
Jamie,
what is the name of the video?

613
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.350
Pratt.
Pratt.
Miller.
See 66.
And uh,

614
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.140
is it smoky tires that's on the smoking tire?

615
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.130
I think it's fucking eight Liter v eight.
It's a gorgeous,
it's a gorgeous,

616
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:09.720
gorgeous car.
And it's super duper fast.
The videos too,
right?
Uh,
yeah.

617
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:13.360
I think it was gold.
Oh my God.
Look,
I'll fin.
I was there sexy bitch.

618
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.940
I was so fucking,

619
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.160
how old's depressing to watch this like five years ago?
So get that dude.

620
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:22.590
You're breathing.
Okay.
You still keep up out of the game.

621
00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.280
I don't tap out before it's too late.
I know.
So this thing,
yeah,

622
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:30.670
it's all carbon fiber body.
It's an eight inches wider than a,
uh,

623
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.540
a regular corvette.
The noise

624
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.840
noise,
it's,
it's,

625
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:40.770
so Pratt and Miller basically is the company that builds gms,

626
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.180
factory race cars.

627
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.480
And so they built sort of a street homologation kind of special of the race car

628
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:53.130
and what they did was they made a new body that was like a really high quality

629
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:57.030
carbon fiber and a super high quality leather interior,

630
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.510
which is something that these cars were really bad.
That's hilarious though.

631
00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:02.490
I haven't looked at this video in a wild looking at it now,

632
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:06.710
it's fucking so silly to think that that was a $200,000 car though.

633
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.620
Is that what it was?
200 grand 0.2 liters.
Yeah,
dude,
I would,

634
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.880
if I got a mother fucker in that pocket,
I might go right to that.

635
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.950
Why not?
400 they built seven of these.
A friend of mine has sold four of them,

636
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.540
but that's a mean,
mean car man.
It's so beautiful.
Yeah,

637
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.770
that's like a perfect American muscle car.

638
00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:31.260
It's still got that cobalt steering wheel calling with leather though that was

639
00:37:31.261 --> 00:37:35.370
leather and stitched like a steering wheel,
like a mouse.
You know,

640
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:37.710
like for a computer.
Why have you have shitty steering wheel?

641
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:41.310
Why have a shitty mouse mouse?
It's really surprising how many people,

642
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:43.980
if you're always using plain about something like a steering wheel and people
go,

643
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.220
what do you give a fuck bro?
And it's like my content,

644
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:50.220
it really on this the entire time I own this car.
But it also,

645
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:54.780
it gives you information about a car,
like in like those,
those uh,

646
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.040
Magnus Walker Porsche's with the Momo prototype.
Oh,
steering wheels.

647
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.830
There's something about those old school steering wheels.

648
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.140
Like you hold it onto him and you're actually trying,

649
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.640
I don't have any Carter's right.
There's no filter straight there.
Leather metal.

650
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:11.390
And then you react to this thing.
But it's also like you,

651
00:38:11.391 --> 00:38:14.600
you're looking down at that thing and it gives you like,
yeah,
this isn't fucking,

652
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.830
yeah,
1972 RS,

653
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:20.600
whatever the hell he goes was the best to get like a 59 caddy with?
Oh,

654
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.290
it's like a steam ship wheel.
You know.
Mean you're like tacking.

655
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.470
Well those were boats.
He,

656
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.510
isn't it interesting that they basically had nautical steering wheels and they

657
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:35.430
totally should had a fucking tiller then,
Huh?
That's were ridiculous.

658
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.040
Oh,

659
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.010
<v 2>and that was just a few decades ago.
Do you know?
You fucking cool.</v>

660
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:43.120
Are we in the late fifties and everyone?
America was fucking cool.

661
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.330
We weren't like the shitbags of the fucking world,
you know what I mean?

662
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:49.900
Everyone didn't hate us.
They wanted our our shit and not just like,

663
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:55.060
you guys hate yourselves now we should.
Our all countries were horrible,

664
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.390
but he's got a lot of weird misconceptions about American,
so we noticed that.

665
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:02.520
Yeah.
I mean not not to black gang up on me,
on team America here.

666
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.460
Just fucking wacky.
Brett's got some crazy ideas about,
okay,

667
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.150
I've found out you guys can play pool.
I found out you guys can drive,

668
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.060
but listen man,
you can drive to just start.
If you want to know too,

669
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.640
you don't just,
you just kind of practice to where that ball's going,

670
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:22.030
dude and planning plays good pool.
I had a guy tell play really good.

671
00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.880
He told me,
play,
you know what?
Good,
how good do you play?
Goes,

672
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:27.760
I could play really good.
I said,
I said,
I,

673
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.810
I said I used to play well and that's what I learned.
No,
no,
no,

674
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.850
no,
no.
I said call you sang,
you play really good.
Ah,
I said I did play well.
Sorry.

675
00:39:36.851 --> 00:39:38.970
That's what I said.
Yeah,
it did play those pos tents,

676
00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:42.520
but I was thinking I was going to be better when we started analysis of this

677
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:43.354
statement,

678
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.420
a couple of balls around the table and he's making all these judgments about me.

679
00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.840
Well,
because you were holding me back an American,
you're holding the cute like,

680
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:49.900
well,
we play snoopy.

681
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.200
Remember when it was first it was best to five and then it became five as you

682
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.900
know.
Hey,
come on.
In all fairness,

683
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:59.200
the last game there was only one little ball left.
It didn't matter.

684
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:00.040
You were never going to get that

685
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.020
last little ball that Paul was never going in.
It was going,
it was going.

686
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:10.980
I just didn't get to it.
Oh,
you build all psychologists,
buddies,

687
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.470
getting to it and then get into the eight ball is beyond preposterous.

688
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.010
Did they weren't anywhere near each other.
I was in no danger.

689
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.250
I was told you the tightness of the pocket.

690
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:24.760
You guys have weird like super tight pockets in the U s we don't play that way.

691
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:25.840
Well is this table really,

692
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:29.170
this is way tighter than a regular table table is a five inch pocket.

693
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:32.490
That's a four inch pocket Ernesto.
And they're still domain guys who's a,

694
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.420
one of the,
he's a big player in la,

695
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:38.110
like pro player and he's also a great table mechanic and him and his son,

696
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:39.430
Oscar was another pro player.

697
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.190
They put together these like I need an Esto cut table,
like a big deal.
Like the,

698
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:47.740
he's the,
he's the master when it comes to putting together those,
uh,
Brunswick.

699
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:50.260
So this guy,
Donnie Wessels sold it to me.

700
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.120
He says 72 73 two.
Oh God.
My first shot,

701
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:56.890
I don't know if you can remember that because it was a while ago,

702
00:40:56.891 --> 00:41:00.160
but my first shot I remember,
I remember so well dude,
I hit it,
I hit it hard.

703
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:01.540
And you say,
why did you hit it so hard?
Right?

704
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.190
And on a normal table it had gone in.
Right.

705
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.490
And instead of just went and did that little pinball thing,
yes.

706
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.970
Shit talking about anything that doesn't matter.
That's the thing.

707
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.910
The ball going or not does not matter to them.
They're Americans.

708
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.140
Americans are getting right now is like a peek into your madness.

709
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.300
The same madness that led you to be this master engineer and an improver of

710
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.880
Porsche's leads you to be a crazy person.

711
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.680
If your fucking miss a shot and a pool table,

712
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:29.320
you're talking about a god damn podcast two hours later.
Well,

713
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:32.710
the reason why that one didn't go,
I'm not American

714
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.540
son was in the wrong place on the horizon and I had a third house,

715
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.380
Vaseline on my fingernails.
No,
you can put your the best,

716
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.580
Best American pool player I've played against.

717
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.210
Well then you ain't play it against shit because I'm fucking terrible compared

718
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:54.920
to like a real good pool player.
So you can't go running around.
You can't please

719
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.990
turn it around telling people you're good at pool.
I wouldn't,

720
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.100
I was doing this thing where you know like man,

721
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:03.560
Americans always say they're good at stuff.
Right?

722
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.620
And then I was just testing you a little bit and you don't me why anybody would

723
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:11.790
say Americans always do this in British people.

724
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.820
Every British person I met has been partially unique and individual and their

725
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:19.190
own personality traits,
the way they behave.

726
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:24.020
So when someone starts saying that every American does this poorly thought out,

727
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.630
it was he and my friend.
I thought,
well,

728
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.650
I want it to see if it was furniture or the real deal.

729
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.090
And I found out it was the real deal.
I found it.
I found out was the real deal.

730
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.810
Pockets,
Bro.
What's up bro?
Pockets.
Well,
yeah,

731
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:40.811
that's going to be my first actually like dumb English person.

732
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.390
We were just in the UK.
I've never,
I don't,
I don't get our education system.

733
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.380
I don't spell it out a time in the UK,

734
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:52.190
but the English accent makes you sound smarter than you are,

735
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:53.210
even if you're not that smart.

736
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.390
We were just in the UK and a waiter had trouble counting the number of people at

737
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:02.990
our table there.
There were five.
Oh my God,
that's a tough one.
That's a tough one.

738
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:07.140
And despite the accent,
I was like,
oh,
you know what fucking stuff.

739
00:43:07.141 --> 00:43:11.930
But part of the UK was that
king was,

740
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.070
there's this place called Palantir.
They build Mclaren.
Yeah.

741
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:22.310
Mclaren maybe they worked them too much and the guy was tired on the field.

742
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.470
You know,
he gets so tired.
You can't even remember your own name.

743
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:29.260
Like what's your name,
sir?
Matt.
Matt Farah.
You know,

744
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:33.350
like you get here in England.
It's Clive.
How to,
how to count to five

745
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:35.421
trauma.

746
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:39.650
Could have been a boxer when he was young or catch though to him playing this

747
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:41.730
particular Englishman.
Stupidity.
Possibly.

748
00:43:41.731 --> 00:43:46.731
He's trying to give him the outs and I'd call it all adds up.

749
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:51.230
You can play pool d benefit lowly

750
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.910
shouts Ross and we'd don't mix together so smoothly.

751
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:58.610
This is something we found out today.
Some people,

752
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:01.490
you give it to them and it releases something inside of them that they should

753
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:06.270
keep in.
She keeps it collected.
Should die of Ghana.
Read.

754
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.870
That's something bad ass car though.
You Make Sur you make a fucking,

755
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.750
it's a photo of it right there.
I have more photos there,
fellow.
No.
Um,

756
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.530
so you've been in this car making business for like how long now?

757
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.890
Since uh,
basically our five oh five.

758
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.800
And before that I thought this was hilarious.
You A,

759
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:28.720
you used to be in the video game world and you were actually on screen savers

760
00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.670
was segments on there still love that show.
That show was great.

761
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:36.970
Leo Laporte Heart and Pat Norton.
Yeah,
the rate show.
I used to love me.

762
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.350
I was a total Uber Geek.
You know,
I used to build my own pcs.

763
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.670
The first hot nerds too,
right?
Oh yeah,
they did.

764
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:48.540
They all went on to do my two young.
Yeah,
you weren't born yet.

765
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.790
It was probably like the early two thousands,

766
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.030
late nineties or late night TV.
Yeah,
it was on,

767
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.890
it was unreal TV show on TV.
It was the only one of its kind.
It was,

768
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:01.520
it was kind of like the top gear without them.
Yeah.

769
00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:04.830
It was a top gear of PC stuff without the buffoonery.
That's what you gotta say.

770
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.830
I was gonna say,
but it has all over Jeremy Clarkson right here in this class.

771
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.550
Your fellow English.
I know what you're doing.
You're about to go to.

772
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:13.500
Why he doesn't like Porsche's and he just says it all the time.

773
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:15.110
So it's hard to see Iti there.

774
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.670
Don't you think he's at least partially a character?

775
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.960
He drove a nine 11 turbo and compared it to the four or five not the four five

776
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:24.390
eight to four 30 member and while ago he did.

777
00:45:24.391 --> 00:45:27.220
He did say he was ranting and raving about how fantastic get smoked.

778
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.840
He smoked the four 30 if I remember,
but he was just talking about how,

779
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.980
but he's also crashed [inaudible] he left the shots in.

780
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.950
That was cool.
But then he blamed the car like I was laying in a pool table.

781
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.540
Well,
you know,
he was saying,
he's saying you,

782
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:49.020
you are not one to just to judge someone else for making excuses.

783
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.900
Never made an excuse in your life.
How have you,

784
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.580
I want to hear your excuse for not making any excuses.
Catholic boarding school.

785
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.570
Okay,
that's my [inaudible] right.
Go with that though.
In fairness,

786
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:03.720
he crashed Porsches and made fun of himself when he did it.
He said,

787
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:04.620
because these cars,

788
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.330
I don't like these cars because they don't tolerate fools and I am a fool.
Yeah,

789
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.510
that's a good line.
It's true.
I mean,
he drives like a fucking maniac.

790
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:17.750
That's half of the fun of him is that he's this kind of unhinged dude who drives

791
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:18.774
like a maniac.

792
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.460
He Shat on a BMW because he spun it in a straight line,

793
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.810
like it was raining and he just spun the car and the,
and his conclusion was,

794
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:28.650
well the thing is though,

795
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:31.490
it hit his kind of car is different than like what I would like.

796
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.130
His kind of car is indeed one that makes smoke everywhere.
It goes sideways.

797
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:37.230
That's why he likes all the big AMG is not the fun.

798
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.150
I kind of like traction and getting into a rhythm and you know,

799
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.570
driving through canyons.
So that's why I like Porsche's.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

800
00:46:43.571 --> 00:46:48.120
I think a car that makes unnecessary burnouts is a kind of stupid car.

801
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.690
It's fun for like a Shelby,
they're fun cars,

802
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.640
but they're kind of stupid.
Like that's fucking retarded.

803
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.370
You're not in control of it.
The whole thing is you're in control of something.

804
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:01.170
You're not in control of it.
You're kind of in control of it,

805
00:47:01.171 --> 00:47:04.440
but it's going sideways like bull riding with one of those.

806
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.170
You know how I got into the car thing too?
I mean I,

807
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.500
I took a nine nine six turbo,
you know,

808
00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:12.630
and I went drag racing with it that talk about stupid.

809
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.430
Write an English guy going to a drag strip.

810
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:17.380
What difference does it make of your English Iranian Polish.

811
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.550
English guys don't drag race around.
We'd go around,
you know,

812
00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:21.860
tracks and splotch Englishman,

813
00:47:21.861 --> 00:47:24.920
they're going to be fucking knocking on your Twitter door.
Drag race,

814
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.660
drag racing seats before you and your Daddy's Dick.

815
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.010
A friend of mine's got a 69 charger in England.

816
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:32.890
He drag races kind of parachuting shit.
Yeah.
So there you go.

817
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.610
So talking nonsense again Jon.
This fucking English people don't do this shit.

818
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:40.300
Sound in your own country.
Been down a river calling Jeremy Clarkson,

819
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:43.780
a scoundrel or some such.
He just doesn't like for us,

820
00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.350
it's always a funny guy,
man.
He doesn't lead the like portion.

821
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.550
That's probably a lot of music he likes and I think is dog shit.
Right.

822
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.150
We don't need to like the same goddamn thing.

823
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:56.130
<v 3>You know what he's,
he's like furniture in her ways.
He's just being around.</v>

824
00:47:56.131 --> 00:47:59.680
You sit on it,
you use it and you appreciate it and often we real,

825
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:01.680
but what's going on here?
You're a Porsche fan.
Boy.

826
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.010
<v 2>I am,
but what?
I'm wearing a [inaudible] shirt.
You are.</v>

827
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.840
It's okay to be a Porsche fan boy.
That's okay.
As long as yeah,

828
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.930
they do make good cars.
I think they make the best cars.

829
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.470
The most satisfying or what I wish they wouldn't do is make four door cars and

830
00:48:16.471 --> 00:48:20.460
sedans and talking out of your nonsense hole because you need to get ahold of

831
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:23.280
one of those Panamera's and dumped that fucking thing.

832
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:28.940
I launched that motherfucker on a highway and watch time bend in front of your

833
00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:34.530
eyes when you're driving a fucking sedan,
some cozy executive chair,

834
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.490
plush leather,
and you're violating time.
Panamera turbo.

835
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.753
I know.

836
00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:48.210
They make all kinds of good noises now.
It's only $190,000.
Yeah.

837
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.280
I drove one to 27 long wheelbase,

838
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:58.310
turbo s was ceramics and the full interior like rear,

839
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.590
we were going to get one to do development on,
right

840
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.350
<v 3>it when it,
before it came out,
we put in an order,</v>

841
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:08.310
what can I possibly do to that thing?
You can,
you can add software,

842
00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:10.380
you can add exhaust cause it's a turbocharged car.
Right.

843
00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:12.690
So we add about a hundred horsepower to those cars,

844
00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:17.670
usually like 700 out of those things.
But I totaled up the bill,
you know,

845
00:49:17.671 --> 00:49:20.990
for the build sheet.
You know,
cause I wanted ceramics to go to have that visit,

846
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.190
like carbon ceramic breaks for geeks.
You know,
they,

847
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.310
they don't create any dust and they don't heat up there.
Great breaks.

848
00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:29.760
They feel like the best breaks ever,
unless mostly forever,

849
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.620
except if you go to the race track.
But anyway,
yeah,

850
00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.490
the bill was like 190 k wow.

851
00:49:35.491 --> 00:49:38.880
190 Kate for a four door car.
Wow.
You know,

852
00:49:38.881 --> 00:49:41.610
and you know how there's four door cars are,
you know,
you,
you uh,

853
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.400
you by him and then two,
three years later,
I mean they're worth,

854
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.970
they're worth nothing and can't get rid of.
Interesting 10 turbos going for now.

855
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.760
Can you get them for like 70 grand yet around?
Yeah.

856
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.170
He can almost turbo,

857
00:49:55.171 --> 00:49:59.790
which I know you you've got and he that was like 108 new,

858
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:00.241
you know,

859
00:50:00.241 --> 00:50:05.241
five and he sold it for 2009 the dealer offered him 20 even on trade.

860
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.550
Yup.
I remember there was one,
uh,
one of my customers,

861
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.770
my customers has had like eight different Cayenne's cause he's at nine 11 turbos

862
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:19.760
all sizes cayennes and one of them was that the Cayenne turbo s and it did its

863
00:50:19.761 --> 00:50:24.360
stickered up to like one 60 something.
Yeah.
Ceramics,
everything.
Arab ceramics.

864
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.190
One of the things that I like about cars is

865
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.790
<v 1>the,
the,
there's a disaster going on right now with American cars.</v>

866
00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.770
There was a long period of just fucking terrible ideas and shitty design and

867
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.180
shit build quality.

868
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:43.600
But at least there's a series of cars that have stuck with a manual

869
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:47.930
transmission.
Only the Shelby gt 500 the viper,

870
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.150
you can't get a fucking automatic.

871
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.000
<v 3>You imagined an automatic viper.</v>

872
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.000
<v 1>They'll make,
you can still,
it's a matter of time.
That's too,</v>

873
00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:00.600
you can start getting the double clutch corvette,
which I think is,
no,

874
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.870
it's not a dull,
oh,
it's still a lot of work converter on.

875
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.400
I thought the new one was a double clutch.
I thought the first dark,

876
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.290
the one that you drove?
No,
Chris Harris drove one and a nine 11 that was an auto.

877
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:15.130
That was an auto fucking on.
It was on.
Shit.
That's such that auto socks too,

878
00:51:15.131 --> 00:51:18.370
but you can get it and stick like you can get it.
As long as you can get it,

879
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.690
it's fine then.
But the new ones,
apparently you've driven it.

880
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.740
Oh chump up.
Huge jump to new Corvettes.
More vets are great.

881
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.720
Just a motherfucker.
They will.

882
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.740
They're the one I drove had like the performance pack on it.

883
00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:34.990
The magnetic ride,
the shocks that,
you know,

884
00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:38.530
this shocks GM has the coolest shocks in the world.

885
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:43.680
They're so cool that Ferrari licenses,
why it's called a,
it's called um,

886
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.690
um,
magnetic ride control.
Sorry.

887
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.430
So the shocks have a magnetic fluid in the shock as opposed to a hydraulic fluid

888
00:51:51.431 --> 00:51:53.990
or whatever that they normally use and they can die.

889
00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:58.650
They send different levels of current through there to make it soft or firm and,

890
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:03.130
and variable.
Right.
And Ferrari uses them on the five,
nine,
uh,
the,

891
00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:06.030
the f 12,
the four,
five,
eight,
all the Ferrari's use them.

892
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:11.120
<v 3>Cool.
They had that cool advert where they had a Cadillac CTSV going around a</v>

893
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.080
racetrack and it was following a Ferrari.
I was,
that was pretty cool.

894
00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:18.770
How they kind of worked together and they actually advertise a Ferrari and a

895
00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:20.810
Cadillac.
Better part of the licensing.
Yeah.

896
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.390
<v 1>But that was,
that was another cool move.</v>

897
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:28.391
Buy a GM when they put out the z 28 or the Xeo six cause he 28 also only

898
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:34.190
standard,
right?
They don't have a no manual manual.
Newsy 28.

899
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.590
Think about that.
The Viper gt 500 to the corvette,
z o six,

900
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:43.370
and the uh,
the corvette [inaudible] all only manual.

901
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.520
<v 3>They did.
So hats off to that,
but actually the new,</v>

902
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.890
so the new z 28 I'm not a Camaro guy.

903
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:52.350
I didn't grow up with any Camaro's or anything.
We didn't have him,

904
00:52:52.351 --> 00:52:57.210
but the new z 28 people should check out if they're into like fun set a track

905
00:52:57.211 --> 00:53:01.230
cars because even guys that have gt threes now that can't drive them,

906
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.210
the new one,
nobody can drive.
Those.

907
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.310
Porsche's called them and said to all 756 so the ones delivered,
Park your car.

908
00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.590
We're coming to get,
you know,
we're coming to get it.

909
00:53:10.591 --> 00:53:14.040
We're going to replace your engine.
There's a problem.
A lot of those guys,
dude,

910
00:53:14.041 --> 00:53:16.200
it's gotten worse.
A lot of those guys are,
you know,

911
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.360
basically going and buying z 20 eights so to go from,
so they

912
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.320
<v 1>gave their car back.
The Z 20 eights are not Harris or Scotland.</v>

913
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.040
I

914
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.420
<v 4>flew all the way to New York to drive it from La and it was raining at the track</v>

915
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:32.550
and they wouldn't let me drive.
It floated across the question.

916
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:35.880
They go note when I go.
I'm like,
yeah,
I'll come on.
And they were like,
they could,

917
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:38.350
they said it was worthless in the wet,
but you know what they,

918
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.350
you know what people have said,
you're going to fucking worthless in the wet too.

919
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.650
Well,
no,
but they,
they immediately cause the new gt three is,
you know,
basically,

920
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.810
you know,

921
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:50.580
it's a PDK and then they go back into a z 28 and they're just having fun because

922
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:54.690
it's math and manual transmission.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's better.
Like you said,

923
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.330
it's more fun.
Yeah.
We're not going to be driving soon.

924
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:59.330
You're not gonna be allowed to do anything.
It just,

925
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.750
just be sitting in there reading your newspaper.

926
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.300
That was an episode of Jerry Clark.

927
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:07.140
Jeremy Clarkson when he was driving the CEO sex or what?
He's trying the Zr one.

928
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.360
Aw,
you listening Ferrari.
Just a regular manual transmission.

929
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:16.560
Why don't you make one of those?
A Ferrari with a manual gearbox is so fun.

930
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.820
It's so dark that they're canceling all that stuff.
It's,

931
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.070
it's the customer's fault.
Dust.

932
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.890
When they started offering paddles instead of a stick,

933
00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:30.030
the the take rate was like 95% is man,
it's a,

934
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:33.630
it's another example of the shitheads taken over the earth.

935
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:38.290
It's like these rich people,
all of them have terrible taste it all day.

936
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.970
It's like what's going on here?
What's the people that are becoming really rich?

937
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.360
Fucking worst man.

938
00:54:43.361 --> 00:54:48.361
Everyone put rims on their shit is by a fucking $300,000 Ferrari and they put

939
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:53.640
fucking rims on it.
Those rooms all gross too.
Like the 22 inch rims,

940
00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:59.190
like wagon wheel looking at west coast customs,
platinum motors,
more garbage.

941
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:02.640
You obviously haven't visited Oakland then.
Have you been visited Oakland?

942
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.480
That's where,
that's where you get some really good,
good,
good spinner.

943
00:55:07.481 --> 00:55:11.670
Like good week
letters have them,
but no,

944
00:55:11.671 --> 00:55:12.840
but I lived in New York,

945
00:55:12.841 --> 00:55:17.390
right and Latrell Sprewell lived right up the street from my parents and

946
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.940
remember back in the day it's the spinners spraying.

947
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.710
Well bought the company that made that,

948
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:26.820
made those and they were called [inaudible] wells for like seven years.
Nice.

949
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.040
Remember everyone used to call spinach free wells back.

950
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:34.220
That was probably very well played for the fucking Nick's.
That's probably,

951
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:38.760
yeah,
I probably gave the gaming in anyway.
Yeah,
it was crazy.
I remember,
I just,

952
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:42.300
I never heard that call him that I just heard spinners and there was the

953
00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:46.050
opposite.
Yeah,
the stairs,
the floaters.
Remember the floaters?
Floaters,

954
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.720
I think I called them stairs.
You called.
It was the opposite because the drive,

955
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.910
but the rim was stay.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Those were pretty cool.
Right?

956
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.540
People gave up on that shit.
Quick high maintenance rims.

957
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:02.850
Well it's also like anytime you hit a Pothole,
no padding,

958
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.740
you would blow out tires left and right.
I don't remember in Porsche is defense.

959
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.010
You know,

960
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:12.360
the other reason they went to PDK and got rid of the six feet was a lot of

961
00:56:12.361 --> 00:56:14.220
people can't drive the car properly.

962
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.420
And what happens is when you take the control away from people and the ability

963
00:56:18.421 --> 00:56:22.130
to do something wrong,
like miss shift or money shift as you call it,
you know,

964
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.900
blow up your engine.
Then some,
you know,
somebody goes back with their car,
says,

965
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:29.440
oh,
I want you to warranty it and fix it.
And they're like,
nerf the world.

966
00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:32.980
Alex Ross,
sorry,
but peanut can't handle it.
Let's narrow the world.

967
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:34.510
They can't get a manual transmission.

968
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:37.040
My grandfather drove a fucking three on the column.

969
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.920
They used to have some crazy gearboxes.
Day three industry?
No,

970
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.570
like the like I just read a manual of how to drive a model t.

971
00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.990
Nothing like what you think you would be.
What was it like?

972
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:54.700
There's like there's a pedal,
but online you're,
yeah,
you're just going,

973
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:56.740
you put it in gear and there's no

974
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:04.450
one gear.
It's too geared two years,
but just the shift itself or do you shut up?

975
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.530
You know,
is there a clutch?
Yes,
there was a clutch,

976
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.690
but there's also like you have to adjust the,

977
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:16.330
the spark advance and like the ignition timing.
Oh yeah.

978
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.600
Whoa.
Yeah.
There's all kinds of stuff going on.
Okay.
Okay.

979
00:57:19.601 --> 00:57:23.320
Like how many different various functions that don't exist.
There's a chart.

980
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:26.860
Is it right here?
Yeah.
Where's the chart keeps keeps going.

981
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.230
This is the instructions of how to drive a model t,

982
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:34.120
but there's a chart that shows all the different positions of the spark.

983
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.990
Advance Levers keep going.

984
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:42.280
It's a huge undertaking to drive a bottle deep.
Wow.

985
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.060
Like pretty much,
it would've been an easier flight plans.

986
00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.210
I don't know where the charts,
there's so many diagrams and she look up,

987
00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:54.430
look up like a model t s a spark advanced charter or something.

988
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:54.820
I don't know.

989
00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:59.820
It's crazy the amount of things that people had to do to drive a car just to get

990
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.710
a card fucking move.

991
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:07.000
So how many different things you're saying adjust the,

992
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.010
so they had like a centrifical type clutch so there was no accelerator pedal

993
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.080
there.
There it is.
Look,
these are all the different.

994
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:18.970
So there's two levers and these are all the different possible positions and

995
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:23.971
their own mind possible combinations of positions for depending on how fast you

996
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:24.971
want to go.

997
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:29.950
So that lever on the right I believe is your actually your throttle.

998
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:33.370
There's no gas pedal that leverages your throttle.

999
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:38.371
So you just set that and it's like cruise control all the time of high gear.

1000
00:58:38.831 --> 00:58:43.480
And low gear.
It's like a crank start.
Use the left lever is spark advance.

1001
00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:46.780
So looks for a speed of 10 miles per hour on high gear.

1002
00:58:46.781 --> 00:58:51.190
Leave spark advanced five notches open gas,
two or three notches.

1003
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:55.060
Holy Shit.
So that's what you do to maintain 10 miles.

1004
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:58.680
And now I know how many people complain when this went away.
Well,
you know,

1005
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.850
I don't even feel like I'm driving a car anymore.
That's exactly what it is.

1006
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.410
I didn't even start my engine with a Flint.

1007
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.180
You kids and your key ignitions are out there with a fucking rock in a file

1008
00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:12.710
trying to start the car.
Tink,
tink,
tink.

1009
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.640
You ever see Leno and his steam cars?

1010
00:59:15.641 --> 00:59:20.590
You've got to light up boiler 45 minutes before you Ngozi.
Really?
Oh my God.

1011
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:21.960
That's the

1012
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.980
<v 2>heat up like a fucking keg of Leno has probably the dopest like that's better</v>

1013
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:31.430
than individual gene to dude.
It's crazy.

1014
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.490
He's got like a warehouse filled.
They warehouse like seven units,

1015
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:39.690
seven warehouses and he has like over shoe.
It's two airplane hangar.
Burbank.

1016
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:43.850
Atlanta was just selling coke the entire time.
How long is it getting this money?

1017
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:48.080
I mean,
this is too much money.
It doesn't even make sense.
He says that he never,

1018
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:52.460
uh,
he doesn't spend his tonight show money.
He only spends his standup money,

1019
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.180
which is in suite,
just sitting on stockpiles of tonight's show.
Cash.

1020
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.210
Unbelievable.
I can't even imagine how much money is,

1021
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:02.280
that's the case because he was the host of the tonight show for what decade?

1022
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:05.420
His car collection is $100 million.
Well,

1023
01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:08.690
just a hundred million dollars with his car collection is worth,

1024
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.250
and he also has like 200 and 2004 and his car collection is worth $500 million.

1025
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.940
If you want to feel really sick,
what,
how's that possible?

1026
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:20.900
Ralph Lauren has 65 cars worth $500 million.

1027
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:24.110
Do the math on that shit.
That's the craziest thing.

1028
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:28.010
Average value of all those like old dog shit.

1029
01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:33.011
Mercedes Benz of north knowing he is one of every Ferrari that one Lamar for

1030
01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:35.280
like 10.
Oh,
he's one of those assholes.

1031
01:00:35.281 --> 01:00:39.830
They're all Phil's cars are old as fuck and almost useless.
That's what I think.

1032
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:43.840
$7 million for Steve McQueen's car.
Well,
you're a fucking idiot.

1033
01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:47.120
Cause Steve wouldn't drive it if he was alive today.
Okay,
if he's alive today,

1034
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.220
go to shark works.
Get himself a fucking real car.

1035
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:53.720
Queen would have one of those dog shit.
Old James Dean kept fucking shit.

1036
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.260
That's all that was available back then.
Duh.

1037
01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.870
20 McKean is alive today.
He'd be driving a fucking Cayenne.
It was

1038
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.520
at 26 inches.

1039
01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:14.180
He'd have spinners were color coded to match the car's interior.
Hey,
spinning.

1040
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:19.490
He fucking,
I would.
Steve McQueen have gone for the painted key option.

1041
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.240
He would've gotten for the matchbox cars.
Look at that.
So that's 50 million.

1042
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:26.270
What that is,
give you 10 bucks for it.

1043
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.290
Then I'd sell it for 20 and be done with it.
There's,

1044
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.140
there's three of those in the world.
Well,

1045
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:35.141
let's blow it up to make this too Goddamn Dodo bird the other ground.

1046
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.480
If I found a dirt Dodo bird today,
if there was only one left,

1047
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:41.660
I'd hit it with a fucking rock.
You wouldn't drop fishmeal on that.

1048
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.740
There was a Dodo bird.
If fucking this is the last remaining,

1049
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:52.750
I'd choke it to death and the bathroom and then I would make a story up the car.

1050
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:57.160
I flush it down the toilet.
I just drowned that fucker.
Oh,
there's some,

1051
01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.940
there's see each of those bright and Mclaren f one that's,
that's my favorite.

1052
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.820
And Mclaren has a new insane card.

1053
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:11.460
It's like one point something million dollars one.
Yeah.
So they have the regular,

1054
01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:15.080
like I found out about this because I was telling people that like the Mclaren,

1055
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:18.050
that's like the more common one.
It doesn't sound very good.

1056
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.000
MP Four twelfths yeah.

1057
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.140
<v 3>Turbocharged car.
Yeah.
So you know those turbos,
they block a lot of the sound.</v>

1058
01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.210
The act like mufflers,
you know,

1059
01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:28.590
so that's aspirated cars are always going to be more loud.

1060
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.400
<v 1>I was telling someone,
he goes,
what are you talking about?
He sends me this video,</v>

1061
01:02:31.401 --> 01:02:34.280
this thing sounds amazing.
I was like,
that is not the same fucking car.

1062
01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:38.120
Like it turns out it's a car that's 10 times more expensive.
Oh,

1063
01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.730
is it a McLaren f one?
It was the new one.
Yeah.

1064
01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:45.731
The p one p one and the p one shoots fire fire like on gas fire.

1065
01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:51.710
It's so good that Chris Harris said it's a step up above the portion nine 18,

1066
01:02:51.711 --> 01:02:54.680
which is like the greatest car in the world has ever known.
Up until a week ago.

1067
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.440
Harris said that the 19 is amazing,

1068
01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:02.441
but the p one is like an alien just dropped a car on earth and this is it.

1069
01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:03.344
You know what I mean?

1070
01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.250
<v 3>I wasn't overly impressed with that nine 18.</v>

1071
01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:10.940
I mean as far as technology it looks,
um,
and does all that stuff really well.

1072
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.100
But honestly I go back to the manual thing.

1073
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.700
I've driven CG ts and that's what I would take.
That thing is amazing.

1074
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.230
That thing is connected.
Yeah.

1075
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:19.283
<v 1>You know what I think?</v>

1076
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:24.490
I think that automotive technology has reached a sufficient limit like with what

1077
01:03:25.251 --> 01:03:30.251
is existing today where we can have these wacky fucking future million dollar

1078
01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:32.510
cars for Russian oligarchs.

1079
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:36.560
You can have these nutty cars that you and I will never be able to afford,

1080
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:41.890
but really like there needs to be some sort of a balance between like the GTR

1081
01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:43.760
type,
super computer,

1082
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:48.910
unbelievable cool car and a visceral car like a car that you feel the engine,

1083
01:03:49.611 --> 01:03:52.070
like a gt three type experience or you know,

1084
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:54.530
something more raw because if they just keep,

1085
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:59.720
they keep overengineering to the point where you just kind of completely lose

1086
01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:04.610
the pleasure from driving like you have to take into the problem is a lot of the

1087
01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:09.050
time the limiting factors to the tires and the driver.
But I think,

1088
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:11.600
don't you think that the way technology is for the equation,
right?

1089
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:14.890
<v 3>You take the driver out of the equation if the shifting has done for you.
Yeah.</v>

1090
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:16.130
<v 1>Will you take some of it?</v>

1091
01:04:16.131 --> 01:04:19.130
But what I'm trying to say is I think that where the technology has reached

1092
01:04:19.131 --> 01:04:19.964
right now,

1093
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:25.150
they can make amazing super competent cars that just five 10 years ago would be

1094
01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.420
Ferrari supercar letter.
Right.
And they can make them what you feel.
Everything,

1095
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:34.080
you know,
they can have incredible performance.
That's thrilling.
Breaking.

1096
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.580
That's fantastic.
Handling that spectacular,
but make it so you could feel it.

1097
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.941
Yeah.

1098
01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:42.530
It's not going to be as fast around a track as a fucking GTR from 2015 but it's

1099
01:04:42.531 --> 01:04:45.470
probably going to be more than fast enough for you.
Like,

1100
01:04:45.471 --> 01:04:49.870
what the fuck are you doing?
Exactly.
Need 600 horsepower here

1101
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.550
<v 3>going like to the NSX.
You know,
when you were driving that,
right.
I mean,</v>

1102
01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.240
it didn't,
it didn't even have 300 horsepower,
but it,
you know,

1103
01:04:58.241 --> 01:05:00.500
it had a good amount of power and then you're thinking like,

1104
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:05.730
now you're driving in gt three s that have over 500 horsepower and then there's,

1105
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.110
you know,
yeah.
Like nine,
nine one turbo s's that have,
you know,

1106
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.983
even more than that.

1107
01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:11.930
<v 1>Well,
that was with Chris.</v>

1108
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.930
Chris Harris had done with that little rally car that he had made.

1109
01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:18.220
He had taken the car and made it really,
really,
it was only 2000

1110
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.120
<v 4>pounds.
Yeah.
Yup.
And he put a 320 plus horsepower engine in it.</v>

1111
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:25.630
That's a rocket.
Oh my goodness.
We also,
you know,

1112
01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:29.520
you're talking about there.
If you want something that's robbed,

1113
01:05:29.521 --> 01:05:31.630
we have shit on the other end of the spectrum too.

1114
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.070
You've got stuff like the aerial Adam.
Yeah,
he's got the,

1115
01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.980
the Morgan three wheeler,
which are,
Larry is fun.
No load God stuff with lotuses.

1116
01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:45.380
Not really.
I tried one of those there.
I drove

1117
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.680
peer can fucking wheels attached to it.
Just felt like,

1118
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:54.550
I don't want to drive one in La.
Nobody like with money wants one.
Yeah.

1119
01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.060
Why is that?
Because they don't feel expensive.
They feel fucking cheap.

1120
01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.320
Light is great,
but most people don't want to pay extra for it.

1121
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:04.990
Like we just had a viper,
right.
We had a,
you know,

1122
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:09.160
viper is the kind of thing that I would,
would want to be driving.
Right.

1123
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:13.000
Because it's fucking loud.
It's got a huge motor.
It's,
it's stick,
you know,

1124
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:17.750
and it's,
and there's a lot of technology in their carbon fiber and it's got a,

1125
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.690
he a ton of horsepower and stuff,

1126
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.220
but they charge you for it where it,
so it,

1127
01:06:23.221 --> 01:06:27.180
the viper was like $140,000,
whereas the,

1128
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:31.420
the career Carerra s the new one,
when they charge you that much money,

1129
01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:36.421
you've got like a Porsche feels more technologically advanced.

1130
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:39.000
You know what I mean?
You have a,
Porsche has got it right.
When,
uh,

1131
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.580
what they did is they do this reverse thing where it's like,
I want,

1132
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.750
I don't want to have a radio.
I don't want to have a sunroof.

1133
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:50.320
I don't want to have this.
And they're like,
no problem.
There's more money.
Yeah,

1134
01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.000
they do charge you more for less.
But we've got some really lightweight,
crazy,

1135
01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:58.240
pure stuff that you can buy that you would never be able to buy years ago.

1136
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.840
Like what?
Ariel?
Adam,
the Bac Mano,

1137
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.450
it looks like a Formula One car.
You can drive on the street.

1138
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.590
What's called the Bac Mano pull that Shit Up Jamie.

1139
01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:13.090
It's really nutty insect burial.
Adam is a ridiculous car.

1140
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.690
There's a lot of ways to die in one of them.
Thanks.
Seems like it.
Yeah,
there are.

1141
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:21.670
And you're in a car.
Yeah.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
What's with the helmet,
man?

1142
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:23.290
What are you doing?
You're on the street and you were,

1143
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:27.660
and how we get to the fucking face.
Get that thing.
That's the BAC motto.

1144
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.930
It's a single seater.
Oh my God.

1145
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.360
I think is kind of stupid because why?
You know this money on this car?

1146
01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:38.980
Are you going to give anyone a fucking ride?
No.
Yeah,
but that's good.

1147
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:41.140
That way you can't get vein when you're ride and get sued.
Yeah.

1148
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:46.720
There's a pro and a con.
I'm a glass half full kind of a guy.
I see that.
I go,

1149
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.670
I see no one wants you to write off of me.

1150
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:54.490
There's no room for bottles and fucking rappers to accumulate.
You know?

1151
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.500
It's like you got to keep that bitch clean.
You're forced to,

1152
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.280
you're not going to sit it on your own garbage.
You're not gonna.

1153
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.000
You're not gonna.
You're not gonna live radio.
You know [inaudible] bitch.

1154
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.970
Imagine a hoarder with a mono that it's like there's nowhere to go,

1155
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.400
but like there's just trash on newspapers.
That car looks so ridiculous.

1156
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:15.980
Pull that picture up again Jimmy and it looks unbelievable.
Like

1157
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.260
<v 2>I can imagine this is a street legal car.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1158
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.730
So anybody could just go out by one of these and you could just see him driving

1159
01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:25.460
down to party.
But the guy who has one of these,

1160
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:28.820
I see them in the canyons on the way.
And what is one of those go for,

1161
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.720
I think it's around a hundred grand that's ill.

1162
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.680
Quite a bit more.
How quick would you die if you got hit in one of those things?

1163
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.880
Very,
very quick.

1164
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.040
Is there any protection at all or does it kill you just to give you more stock?

1165
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.820
Carbon monocoque,
right.
Instead of a having an air bags,

1166
01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:46.730
it has spikes that come out of the dashboard and she'd write to your fucking

1167
01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.110
brain.
I think it is.
Don't hold the chassis.
Yeah.

1168
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:55.130
Can you enlarge that picture?
It's for one,
but they didn't want you to see it.

1169
01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.260
There's nothing there.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's a tube frame.
Yeah.
You would die very,

1170
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:03.050
very quickly if you were in an Ibu.
I,
me Bro.

1171
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:06.290
And walk away from that like nothing.
I've got a different,

1172
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:10.820
different set of rules.
You're a mortal,
obviously.

1173
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.570
I just know how to get away a roll with punches.
You know,

1174
01:09:13.571 --> 01:09:15.980
I've been around the block,
Bro.
I grew up in New York.

1175
01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:19.130
You know those fucking guys pretend like,
listen,
don't worry about me.

1176
01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:21.770
I grew up in New York.
Like,
what do you do?
You have like a different,

1177
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:24.470
no structure there from her face with a pipe.

1178
01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:28.730
You're going to feel the same shit as a guy from Cleveland.
Fuck it.
Fuck.

1179
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.730
Are you saying Ariel Adam put your helmet on,

1180
01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.530
but you fucking superhero outfit if you don't have like an actual,
you know,

1181
01:09:36.531 --> 01:09:40.320
death,
which is that like someone's grandma sitting in that car.
Oh,
it's,

1182
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.750
uh,
there's a baby in that lady's arm dog.

1183
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.560
It's a dog.
Oh,
Christ.
There's a

1184
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:53.240
kind of an asshole drives Carlick tout it Kinda guy who's dating a chick or

1185
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:58.010
brings her fucking dog everywhere.
He said,
have you seen a noble?

1186
01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.340
Yes.
Yeah,

1187
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.950
yeah.
It's very kit car.

1188
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.000
It's sort of try really hard,

1189
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:11.660
not one of those things where you bring it somewhere and they have to put the

1190
01:10:11.661 --> 01:10:15.050
engine in kind of.
How's that work?
You buy the car,

1191
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.040
you buy the chat by the engine,
you buy the engine from them too?
Yeah.

1192
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:22.190
Couldn't you be like,
listen bitch,
I'll say I did it,
but can't you do it?

1193
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.060
They have a guy here as long as they do in this country,
you don't do it.

1194
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.051
Like they said,

1195
01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:30.770
they ship it into the u s separately and then do what they would call a final.

1196
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:32.810
But that's to get away from something.
Right.

1197
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:36.080
What is it to get away from it again around airbag standards so they don't have

1198
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:36.950
air bags?
No.

1199
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.940
What the fuck can I carved piece of shit is that you want to fucking last made

1200
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:45.440
the airbag saved his life.
Do you want to raw so by a fucking Porsche?

1201
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.740
Yeah.
That's noble m 600 yes.
That doesn't have any air bags?
No.
Hmm.
Well,

1202
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:54.680
I remember it might have first generation,
it doesn't have smart airbags,

1203
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.680
but she saw,
you know,
like on top gear.
I mean they test stuff.

1204
01:10:57.681 --> 01:10:59.480
Obviously they test stuff the way they do.

1205
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:03.980
But you saw that thing didn't even last the test they had to like give me it

1206
01:11:03.981 --> 01:11:06.200
broke up.
Oh that's not good.

1207
01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.290
Well a lot of cars break if that is not like that

1208
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:14.500
Zendo was,
oh that was crazy.
Yeah.
Implied

1209
01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.100
<v 4>that the Tesla roadster ran out of battery.</v>

1210
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.100
It didn't actually run out of battery.

1211
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.490
It had some kind of issue like with,
I don't,

1212
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:26.970
maybe the breaks or has some kind of issue,
but they're trying to push it.

1213
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:31.880
So they got someone got shot,
got a shot,
him pushing it.
They figure out a beat,

1214
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:35.820
a shot of them pushing it and then they did a voiceover implying that it had run

1215
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:40.110
out of battery when actually it was being pushed for a completely unrelated

1216
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:43.780
reason.
Douchey.
The judge sided with top gear acts.
Really?
Yeah.

1217
01:11:43.781 --> 01:11:45.600
The judge sided with ties.
Creative license.

1218
01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:50.601
Just to make a funny show as as they said that it wasn't slanderous because,

1219
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:55.880
yeah.
But it wasn't,
you know,
beyond the realm of possibilities.

1220
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.140
Then vote guys actually ended up suing them.
The car caught on fire.

1221
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.980
They're super car caught on fire,
on top gear,

1222
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:05.970
and that was like the replacement car for the replacement.
So it was not,

1223
01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:09.970
it didn't go down too well.
So wait a minute,
they had a car that caught on fire.

1224
01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:11.720
He Bro,
it was a car from Poland.

1225
01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:15.700
First one broke and then the second one caught on fire and they blame top gears.

1226
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.880
They said,
well yeah,

1227
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:21.650
they sued him for liable because they were basically saying the car.
Yeah,

1228
01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:25.620
they just do not.
They should.
It's a piece of shit.
It's a silly law.

1229
01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:28.770
Suit me a car and one of them breaks.
The other one catches on fire.

1230
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.530
It's not a good way to a fucking Warren.
The troops.

1231
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.920
Well then they eventually got a got it working and the anything that had to do a

1232
01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:36.900
lap around the track,
you want to do the labs,

1233
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:39.890
but it was wet and this car's got a thousand horsepower.
Oh,

1234
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:44.930
it wasn't like slower than like a Ford truck sliding all over the place.

1235
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.190
You know what it was.
It's this.
I think,
you know,

1236
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.490
we probably could be guilty of doing this too,

1237
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.340
but when you work on something for two,
three years,

1238
01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:57.450
you're in your own cave and you just forget what the rest of the world when you

1239
01:12:57.451 --> 01:13:01.470
just start believing your own crap,
you know,
certainly people who are mean.

1240
01:13:01.471 --> 01:13:04.860
No one's perfect.
I can definitely happen.
It's definitely a piece of shit.

1241
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:08.390
I just think I listen to you,
my friend and is a fucking,
you know,

1242
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.850
you're the one of the main t.

1243
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:14.850
One of the main reasons that I stopped that process of building that a old

1244
01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:19.440
Porsche Porsche.
Yeah.
I stopped to talking to me about it.

1245
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.970
Yeah,
you were,
you were saying,

1246
01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:24.070
don't kill yourself and get a 73 and then I was like,
what?

1247
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:29.010
Everybody says it like you drive one of those things.
It's
not really,

1248
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.170
that's kind of cool for awhile,
but you're going to get tired.

1249
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.110
There's this is the car,

1250
01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:39.000
the Zendo that that caught fire that looks pretty bad ass does.

1251
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.640
That looks like what an Nsx from 2015 should look like.
Yup.

1252
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.330
It's a good looking car to their credit.
NSX,

1253
01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.410
make a car like that and put a fucking stick shift in a bitch.
Yeah,

1254
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:51.420
if they could just do that.
If they made the new NSX,

1255
01:13:51.421 --> 01:13:56.220
but it's going to be four wheel drive too,
which is like so anti Nsx.
It's crazy.

1256
01:13:56.250 --> 01:14:00.240
It's just a badge at this point.
Someone would make a really minimalist car,

1257
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.030
just cut out all fucking no navigation.

1258
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.070
Real manufacturer has like the build real things,
right.

1259
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:12.040
Radio three Rs is kind of that.
It has a little

1260
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.340
<v 2>bit,
okay.
It has ac older.
You can order it without if you want to be that stupid,</v>

1261
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:20.100
but it certainly is.
Certainly anyone get the cars.
There were,

1262
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.660
there were a couple of people,
I'm not going to name names,

1263
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.480
I'm not going to name me.
It wasn't me,
wasn't me.

1264
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.740
Want everybody to smell them.
You need a reason.

1265
01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.250
I come on and [inaudible] fetish.
Oh he,

1266
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.270
that was a matter of Ferris voice.
Not Joe Rogan's or Alex Robin.
No,
no.

1267
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:42.670
I love looking for sale.
I love old people.
Everyone

1268
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.710
dive onto the Persian bosses that would have not to care.

1269
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.890
Which way you drive into the bowl

1270
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:58.500
Mercedes with gold badges and those fucking who's more successful and the

1271
01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:00.700
purchase.
You're going the way I'm going with this man.

1272
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.980
It's like it was more successful in America.
What persons are super successful?

1273
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:10.660
Yeah,
they're good negotiators.
Are they?
Uh,
they try.
They fucking try it.

1274
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:14.290
Some folks love that.
They love to borrow like,
not really a barter.

1275
01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:17.290
I'm not know what a headache that shit at all.
I can't just stop.

1276
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.124
How you full price?

1277
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.020
Just fucking get out of here in an extra $2.

1278
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.650
Oh No.
Well how do you barter if there's a price on there already?

1279
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:30.130
How do you do that?
Some people just do you tell him,
hey bro,
this is no good.

1280
01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:34.240
This place.
Come on Bro.
Give you better prices.
Fucking $2,000 for this TV,
Bro.

1281
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.950
This is not $2,000 TV,
Bro.
It's a good TV,
bro.
It's not 2000.
You know,

1282
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:42.280
I know Samsung.
Okay.
I know there's a dude who,
uh,

1283
01:15:42.281 --> 01:15:45.050
went to school with his uncle is Samsung.
All right.

1284
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.120
I could call Sam right now.

1285
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:53.670
Give me the fucking straight dope of this ship box TV.
Got,
this is last year's,

1286
01:15:53.671 --> 01:15:56.860
Bro.
This is last year.
You're going to have to get rid of this soon,
right?

1287
01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.570
Come on Bro.
Not a
circuit city,
right?
Yeah,

1288
01:16:01.571 --> 01:16:04.780
that's my Lovick hustler voice.

1289
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:09.700
Hopefully we don't get to the point where you need that one.
It's possible.

1290
01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:14.110
You could be like a,
like a Slavic Guy and a Guy Ritchie movie.
I would love that.

1291
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:17.100
I would love that.
I'd be so happy.
You know that Guy Nick,

1292
01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:19.210
there's a guy named Nick Moran who was in lock stock.

1293
01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:24.211
He plays Nick and I happen to find myself at a bar and I sat down next to this

1294
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:25.840
guy and then holy shit.

1295
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:28.390
And whenever I tell you that the guy from fucking lock stock and it was him.

1296
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.280
That's hilarious.
That's a great fucking great dude.
Whatever you,
you,
you know.

1297
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:35.050
No big deal.
He took a chance.
So one of the,

1298
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:38.140
I was the only guy right there at that bar that asked him if he was the guy from

1299
01:16:38.141 --> 01:16:42.750
lock stock.
It's a lad and wrong with asking that question.
That guy,

1300
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:46.300
Guy Richie got some fucking banging movies.
He had a run.
What happened?

1301
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:49.270
Madonna Mcdonald sucked the soul out of his dick.
She,

1302
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:53.470
that's how she got younger and that relationship that she lost about five years

1303
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:55.760
of age,
she pulled it right out of his cock.

1304
01:16:55.761 --> 01:16:59.020
All creativity in the middle of the night.
She mountain like a fucking demon.

1305
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.890
Like little clause cleaning,
holding them in place,

1306
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.130
sacking his fucking soul right out of his dick who will cover up.

1307
01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:14.380
It's going to take a few years.
They'll come back with some new snatch,
you know,

1308
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.670
I call it snatch Jude's posters.
Just Madonna's face.

1309
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:22.430
Just Madonna bending over to pick up a toothbrush that

1310
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:31.460
snatched two.
Who's dead,
who died and snatch snatch the old diamond guy,

1311
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:35.860
right?
Isn't he dead?
No.
Uh,
wait.
Which fuck they'll,
Jewish diamond guy.

1312
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:41.240
Dennis Farina.
Farina was fucking awesome.
Don't go to lunch in real life too,

1313
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:44.450
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think he lived in the movie and died in real life.

1314
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.760
That guy was great and that was,
he was a cousin half.

1315
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:50.840
No cousin Abby was the other guy at the English guy that it was,
yeah.

1316
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:56.330
[inaudible] great fucking movie that was locked up
and snatch great.

1317
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.490
Both of them were,
fuck,
I like lock stock better though.

1318
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:02.060
That was the original and actually what they said was snatch was sort of watered

1319
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:06.440
down.
It was like the rehash of it so that you guys didn't need subtitles.

1320
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:08.960
Well he added up.
It's always this you guys shit.

1321
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.300
You get you guys like country brings you in

1322
01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.950
under a nuclear umbrella.
What do you do?
Your shit all over us.

1323
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:19.040
He talks shit about our pool playing abilities.

1324
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.060
How we like to Brag on what we can do and it's never really true.

1325
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.540
We're too stupid to understand the German cars.

1326
01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.840
They give us a watered down version of what the fuck bro.
What the fuck?

1327
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:32.000
I got two words for you,
Toby.

1328
01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:36.350
Keith Holby fucking that's what America makes.

1329
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:41.660
Well I admitted I hadn't been nine 11 song guy too.

1330
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.400
Did I admit it?
The,
uh,
no,

1331
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.313
<v 5>look</v>

1332
01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.140
the look in your face while you were saying,
yeah,

1333
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.790
perfect look and a perfect was that the guy with the nine 11?
Sorry,

1334
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:14.010
that was funny.
What would you do?
I tell you what I wouldn't do.

1335
01:19:14.011 --> 01:19:14.844
It wouldn't make that far.

1336
01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:20.490
<v 2>Her friends,
mutual friends that listen to that shit and go,
man and Toby,</v>

1337
01:19:20.491 --> 01:19:23.190
you might want to try from the beginning,
start all over again with this one.

1338
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.120
You everything.

1339
01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.390
The reason you're not a famous musician is because if you came up with half the

1340
01:19:27.391 --> 01:19:29.790
shit on the radio,
you go,
no,
this is terrible,

1341
01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:31.770
and just throw it away and never play it again.
No,

1342
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:34.740
I'm not a famous musician because I have no musical talent whatsoever.

1343
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.750
You guys could teach us wrestling.
That's what she could do.

1344
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:40.920
You guys could teach us wrestling.
The Brits Americans.

1345
01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:43.320
You guys are good at that.
Very good at that.
Well,
you know what?

1346
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.060
I don't believe in you guys.
First of all,

1347
01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:47.340
I don't believe in you guys and this fucking country because you this,

1348
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.880
this country is basically a colony of people came from somewhere else.

1349
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.060
The idea that we're all the same,
but we came from somewhere else.

1350
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:58.390
It's pretty fucking stupid and kind of,
you know,
it doesn't work that way.
Yeah.

1351
01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:01.620
The whole Australians are criminal immigrant people.
They're not anymore.

1352
01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.160
The immigration people refuse to believe that they were immigrants at one point.

1353
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.910
Yeah,
that's a great one.
It's the whole country full of immigrants won't let it.

1354
01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:13.000
Where are we rounding off?
This is it.

1355
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:18.000
The doors are closed.
There's healings over,
there was a great commentary on,
uh,

1356
01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.811
on immigration.

1357
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:23.160
This dude was like a Canadian illegal immigrant and like lived in Arizona for

1358
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:27.180
like four years.
No one gave a shit.
Nobody questions him.
Ever.

1359
01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:30.830
Everybody mean my green card.
They're like,
okay,
you want me to pay in cash?
No,

1360
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.940
it gives us like the gardeners are getting ticked off fucking one by one by ins

1361
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.080
though.
Yeah.
It's really,

1362
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.070
it's fucking hard to get into this country and get papers.
Yeah.

1363
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.000
It's hard to immigrate.
I had to take the test.
Let me tell you.
Oh,
you know what?

1364
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:49.620
Fuck it.
Go for you.
So I studied history.
I was,

1365
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.210
it was a perfect score.
And you know what else?

1366
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:55.800
There was a series on HBO at the time,
Bro.
No,
I do.
I'm just telling you.

1367
01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.660
I'm telling you.
Okay,
so you guys make good TV was it was on,

1368
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:05.010
what was it John as you guys shit,
it was John Adams,
right?
You remember that?

1369
01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.720
It was on HBO at the time.
It really helped me with my test.
Paul Giamatti.

1370
01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:14.700
John One.
That one?
Yeah,
it was good.
That's good shit.
You didn't eat well.

1371
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.990
He's was on Hbo.
You guys.
You guys are fucking,

1372
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.630
we do make good fucking too though.
Do we make good car shows?

1373
01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.710
What is this country look like from afar?
So very big.

1374
01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:29.340
Talk about not,
not the visual look like when you're talking about

1375
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:35.400
how crazy this country is,
like as someone who grew up in Britain,
when you look,

1376
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:37.470
when you come over here and you see,
you know,

1377
01:21:37.471 --> 01:21:40.230
when you're looking at America from Britain,
like what is your impression of it?

1378
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.370
Does it seem as ridiculous as it does once you're here or does it seem more

1379
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:46.050
ridiculous because you're over there in England?

1380
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:50.060
<v 3>So I'll tell you the,
I'll tell you the honest,
honest truth,
right.
I went to the,</v>

1381
01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:52.640
like pretty much the best school in England,

1382
01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:57.080
you know the princes and the royal family go there.
Yeah.
There to Westminster.

1383
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.820
Remember I said 10 60?
It was built in 10 67.

1384
01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:03.500
One is posh eaten son.
Dude.

1385
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.960
I just took the plumbs out of my mouth where as soon as I came here because

1386
01:22:05.961 --> 01:22:07.460
nobody understood that the damn thing.

1387
01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:09.140
I said I couldn't even order Mcdonald's here.

1388
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.880
Cause you look to Polsh pretty much.
Yeah.
Pretty boy.
No,
no,

1389
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:18.490
that's a different country.
That's,
that's,
that's your,
that's your,
uh,

1390
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.810
that,
that uh,
you know,
look,
you know,
small,
small,
little island.
You know,

1391
01:22:23.811 --> 01:22:27.890
you come over here and you really can't do all this crazy shit here that I could

1392
01:22:27.891 --> 01:22:28.730
never have done.

1393
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:33.970
Like this tuning stuff with porches or overclocking pcs being a.com person,

1394
01:22:34.311 --> 01:22:36.680
you know,
Internet,
celebrity.
I could never have done that in England.
You know,

1395
01:22:36.681 --> 01:22:40.040
why?
Cause we're just behind there and everyone's like,
no.

1396
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:45.490
Did you just get pigeonholed and you have to have parents or friends or know

1397
01:22:46.071 --> 01:22:48.140
somebody.
I mean,
I literally,
you know,

1398
01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.180
I met some really cool people and I just said,
hey,

1399
01:22:50.181 --> 01:22:53.020
let's just start fucking around with Porsche's.
I mean,

1400
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.700
<v 2>you mean once you came to America?
What I was trying to get at was like,</v>

1401
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:00.360
what is it,
what's the opinion of America when you live it over in England?

1402
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:03.900
Does it look like when you see people were invading Afghanistan,

1403
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.470
fucking blowing up Iraq and so missiles into Pakistan from robots that fly in

1404
01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:12.820
the sky or sucking up all the oil stuff didn't bug us at all.

1405
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.920
Awesome neighbors.
Crazy.
I didn't fucking phrase

1406
01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:23.490
<v 3>what really fucking pissed us off serious is when you come into our pubs is your</v>

1407
01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:24.730
shitty rain jackets

1408
01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:29.700
<v 2>talking to all Americans this weekend?
Yeah.
Matt Farah.</v>

1409
01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.980
I don't own a single north face.
I

1410
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.630
won't be here with this bull shit

1411
01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:38.301
<v 3>shit.
Yeah.</v>

1412
01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:43.250
So I'd be surprised when you know you get beaten up or what?

1413
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.650
I'm in the UK but it,
wait a minute.
Wait.
Don't be surprised.

1414
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:48.370
<v 2>Beaten up.
I'm always surprised when I get beaten up,</v>

1415
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.470
beaten up so often the you surprise,
I'd be like,
God damn man,
you gotta Fuck Gun.

1416
01:23:54.471 --> 01:23:56.110
Some roads,
different places.

1417
01:23:56.490 --> 01:24:00.470
You've got to talk to people nicer fucking getting beaten up left and right,

1418
01:24:00.471 --> 01:24:04.350
and it's not surprising.
You fucking make it some critical errors.
Basically.

1419
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:05.223
Everywhere you go,

1420
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:10.660
I'm a fucking constantly shocked and I'm beaten up every time it's ever happened

1421
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:15.130
to build like,
what the fuck did I do?
This led to this.
Let's break this all down.

1422
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:17.980
Never repeat this problem again.
He's like,
well,

1423
01:24:17.981 --> 01:24:22.840
they were wearing the wrong jackets so we had a cone of them for the Queen.
Okay?

1424
01:24:22.841 --> 01:24:27.841
You can sit the wrong colors on the northface inquisition and he was pulling on

1425
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:29.530
the wrong Patchett.

1426
01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:35.130
We signed the Patagonia Charter in 2014 Naco Sandwich coming your way,

1427
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:40.180
mate for vendetta.
All weather gear.
Okay.

1428
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.200
You know what we do like,
like afraid of her neck,
wet

1429
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.340
down your redneck.

1430
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:52.580
<v 3>You know what movie you need to see as sexy beast.
That's what you need.</v>

1431
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.830
<v 2>You Go,
what the fuck?
I've seen.
You said telling me what movie I need to see.</v>

1432
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.960
That will be twice you people don't see sex.

1433
01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.440
People don't even know how to make it good,
proper movie else.

1434
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:07.920
You can't hear Jimmy.
I can't hear Jamie's.
Why?

1435
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:10.690
What was up with that?
How'd you guys let that guy banging on those kids.

1436
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:13.230
<v 3>Dot Guy was a frigging creep.</v>

1437
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.770
<v 2>I don't know.
You don't know.
Is that our Jerry Sandusky?</v>

1438
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.280
<v 3>What?
It is when you,
when you work for the BBC,
like I said,</v>

1439
01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:23.410
you worked for the BBC that long.
He was just like a,
you know,

1440
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:26.420
a piece of furniture and nobody would say anything or do anything.

1441
01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:30.040
And I don't know,
I can say wait worse cause I would send the Dusky pronto dude,

1442
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:34.930
probably it was probably no how many people he's okay.
He's way worse.
I mean,

1443
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:39.610
you know,
he was basically dealing with handicapped kids,
like kids that were,

1444
01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:43.750
you know,
six to 10 years old.
That's,
and who's the newscast or something?
No,

1445
01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:47.300
he would,
he was like a,
you know,
uh,
make your wish foundation.
I've been there.

1446
01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.200
Yeah,
dude,
fuck off.
No Dude,
you're that guy touches kit.

1447
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:56.720
That's him when he was young.
If you look at him,
look at him later on.
Maybe you,

1448
01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.460
oh man.

1449
01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:01.460
When he got all his white hair and that was the creepiest looking guy obviously.

1450
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.760
Yeah.
That's what else is the good guy.
When she moved,
there you go.
There you go.

1451
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:05.870
That's,
that's more like it.

1452
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.600
That's how I remember him growing up watching TV or I remember him.

1453
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.190
So he would make your wish come true.

1454
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:14.000
So if you want it to meet an athlete or you want it to meet a race car driver,

1455
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:17.720
you know,
you would write,
you would write him a letter,
right?
You'd say,
dear GME,

1456
01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:22.460
um,
I'm,
I'm a poor kid in Middlesborough,
which is a place in England.

1457
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:27.710
And,
uh,
I always wanted to meet James Hunt.
Okay.
He would make that happen.

1458
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:33.750
<v 1>That,
that was his lunch and we'll fix it.
We'll fix it.
Uh,</v>

1459
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.720
Louis Theroux on the podcast.
Documentarian from England.
Fantastic guy.

1460
01:26:38.721 --> 01:26:41.290
Have you ever seen this documentary?
Maybe our,
maybe I have.
I don't know.

1461
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:42.470
I don't think so.
I followed that guy.

1462
01:26:42.471 --> 01:26:45.110
He hung out with that guy for days and interviewed him several,

1463
01:26:45.111 --> 01:26:49.280
several times and then got to the point of relationships and girlfriends and you

1464
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:49.461
know,

1465
01:26:49.461 --> 01:26:53.660
it was really creepy cause he was basically saying like one single one like no,

1466
01:26:53.661 --> 01:26:58.310
never,
no,
never have ever had friends that are girls.

1467
01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:58.980
You know,

1468
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.760
it was just sort of skirting around the issue and he's sitting there with a

1469
01:27:01.761 --> 01:27:05.530
cigar.
His lady always smoked cigars.
That's right.
His legs crossing.

1470
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.310
That's trained praying mantis position.

1471
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:12.200
That older dudes that have had a lot of atrophy of their thigh muscles feel

1472
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:15.050
super comfortable bending the legs and that way,
you know?

1473
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:17.660
And he said there was this little foot dangling and he's talking about,

1474
01:27:17.661 --> 01:27:19.190
he's never had like one girl.

1475
01:27:19.191 --> 01:27:22.040
It's always just like counting down the minutes until he can touch another kid,

1476
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:25.160
which just sweat.
He's like,
you know how you get meat and sweats after you like

1477
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:31.820
he's getting beat sweats,
thinking about kids.
It's waiting fucking,

1478
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:36.720
he's got a million kids,
leaves the door,
blows open and awake.

1479
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.020
One giant mass texts to every kid.
As far as what was weird

1480
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.830
<v 3>though,
like at the time you would see him,</v>

1481
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:47.240
he would get all physical with the kids and stuff.
He was like,
you would see him,

1482
01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.130
you know,
hugging them and,

1483
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.740
<v 1>but nobody raised a question or not to put them on his laptop,</v>

1484
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.950
on his lap and everything.
People are fucked up.
I did.

1485
01:27:54.951 --> 01:27:57.980
I agreed that was messed up.
What happened was the guy who had become,

1486
01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:01.460
according to Louis through the guy had become a huge celebrity and it was almost

1487
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.580
untouchable because he was so loved and he had all these charitable

1488
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:07.870
organizations and that's the same way Sandusky hit his head.

1489
01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.810
Ophelia was through charitable organizations and they would do charities for

1490
01:28:11.811 --> 01:28:14.900
kids that didn't have families.
Kids who were injured,
kids who were sick,

1491
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:17.390
who had no one to talk to.
Michael Jackson was the same thing.

1492
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.300
Michael Jackson would work with a lot of kids that had terminal illnesses,

1493
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:24.050
which is the darkest shit ever.
You know,

1494
01:28:24.051 --> 01:28:28.810
because you know that he was praying those kids didn't recover.
No.

1495
01:28:28.811 --> 01:28:31.700
When you say back of his head,
he was like,

1496
01:28:31.701 --> 01:28:34.040
please die with you.

1497
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:36.890
Secrets believe want to talk to you.

1498
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:40.580
But he's talking crazy talking about where

1499
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:45.710
he's just making shit up.
Go ahead and talk to him.
You must be at the end.

1500
01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:49.750
He's not lucid.
I Dunno.
He's making things happen.
And Don and Stan,

1501
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:52.310
I was in the room with them the whole time.
There was no ferries.

1502
01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.400
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
okay,
so it's not a good idea to have,
you know,</v>

1503
01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:02.070
your teenage kid hanging around with the grown dude basically.

1504
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.470
<v 2>No.
Well it depends on the ground,
dude.
I mean look,</v>

1505
01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:08.930
there's a lot of kids are grown dude who doesn't like to touch kids.
Dicks.

1506
01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.750
That's a good filter.
Yeah.
I mean look,
aren't there and work backwards.

1507
01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:17.810
When I was a 19 or 20 I used to take my buddy's brother who was like 13 fishing.

1508
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:21.330
I never fucked them once.

1509
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:26.790
You were only 19 I'm talking about like a seven year old fucking good kid and he

1510
01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:28.720
likes to fish and I do too.
And you just,

1511
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.640
just cause I was way older than I'm most,

1512
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:34.830
they just left him seven or eight years old.
We went fishing together.

1513
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:36.840
I brought him home.
We had a great time.
Nobody got touched.

1514
01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.900
You can have a little friend.

1515
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:44.550
I know how hard that is to [inaudible] was very easy not fishing for sharks.

1516
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:47.730
Right?
Thanks.
Anymore not fishing for sharks.
Yeah.

1517
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.020
Would not fishing for shutting down.

1518
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:53.220
We were fresh water for shit because I told you what happened.
Sharks.
Harpoons.

1519
01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:55.780
No.
I would use everything possible to fix a shark.

1520
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.190
Fins do not make your Wang bigger.
They do not start them offense.

1521
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.650
I'm talking about killing sharks.
See,
listen,

1522
01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:04.470
you got to think for sharks too and we need to talk about this on the podcast

1523
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:07.980
just cause your nickname is sharky.
Okay.
What if your nickname was cocky?

1524
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:10.510
Would you be running around trying to save dicks?
I just,

1525
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.050
it was awkward

1526
01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:17.670
just standing there.

1527
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:23.510
Porsche mechanic in the world standing.
There are no jobs left and right out.

1528
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.000
Man Loss.

1529
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Maybe we need to change our phone number one 800 faster than formula one cars,

1530
01:30:29.851 --> 01:30:31.350
but it's got badges all over.

1531
01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:37.050
You know how bad the Porsche gt three RS logos are?

1532
01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:41.250
The little stickers or even worse,
it'd be just dishes.
Veiny

1533
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:46.590
big Dixon Orange Dicks,
and that's supposed to be going forward,

1534
01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:49.780
which doesn't even make any sense.
I'm going to cars driving for the spoon.

1535
01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:50.880
She'd be maybe going backwards.

1536
01:30:50.881 --> 01:30:54.670
I can exhaust jet the car into the proper direction.
Love it.

1537
01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.970
It gets you a one 18th scale gt.
Three to hand paint the fucking Cogworks.

1538
01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.380
Yes,
sharks suck.
Okay.
I know they're necessary and what?

1539
01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:07.890
I've heard so many people,
you're so fucking ignorant and close mine.

1540
01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.600
I'll get these tweets.
You need to relax.
First of all,

1541
01:31:09.601 --> 01:31:13.230
I don't believe a fucking thing.
I'm saying right now that this is not,

1542
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.620
I'm not in court.
I'm not giving an affidavit and not teaching the children.

1543
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.450
This is what I'm saying.
Fuck sharks.

1544
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.940
And I'm saying if I had a grenade and it was attached to a spear,

1545
01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:24.830
I'd stuff it right into a shark's Dick and blow them right out of the water just

1546
01:31:24.831 --> 01:31:27.640
in the chance that maybe he could bite somebody that I love.
How about that?

1547
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:31.600
Really,
really?
How about that?
Not really.
It holds it nice.

1548
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:36.570
That's how I roll when it comes to the ocean.
The ocean can all suck.
My Dick.

1549
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.070
This is what I want to do with the ocean.

1550
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:41.790
I want to take parts of it and netted in and then throw in shit that can grow,

1551
01:31:41.791 --> 01:31:44.610
that I can eat later and just keep it trapped.
And then when I wanted,

1552
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.130
I scoop it up with nuts.
That's all I care about.
Fish.

1553
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.990
I give zero fucks about fish.
Every fish has ever lift and go,
fuck it's mother.

1554
01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:55.950
All right.
I don't care what fish touched you.
Nothing.
I'm on team.

1555
01:31:55.951 --> 01:31:59.680
People did a grouper put his mouth on.

1556
01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:01.930
I'll have to say if you're a person,
okay,

1557
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:05.260
and you have a pet fish and it dies and you cry,
you're a fucking silly pitch.

1558
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:10.090
That fish didn't know you were alive just to give a fuck about you.

1559
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:13.750
If you drop dead in front of it,
it couldn't care less.

1560
01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:18.190
He couldn't possibly care less.
But you're like,
oh no,
it was movie.

1561
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.880
Redfish
what luck fish.

1562
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:26.600
What five year olds are tweeting at you about their fish?
Oh,
no one.

1563
01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:29.990
But I'm just anticipating,
I'm never had it.
I've never even had a goldfish.

1564
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:35.450
I had a huge tank fill the Puranas.
Yeah,
it was pretty dope.

1565
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.940
I got rid of him,
I've heard it was illegal,
and I said,

1566
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.320
I just won't stand for this any longer.

1567
01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.960
You can get shredded red belly for honors belly or the black ones.

1568
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.090
Which ones would they like to have?
Two different kinds of parameters.

1569
01:32:50.091 --> 01:32:53.180
I had red belly Paranas and I had these other ones that were like silver.

1570
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.040
I forgot what they were called,
but they were different.

1571
01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:56.590
They looked a little different,
but they were all ruthless.

1572
01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.110
Largers did it ever get boring watching them shred shit?
No.

1573
01:33:00.111 --> 01:33:03.080
They boring when they're not spreading shit.
When they're not shutting shit.

1574
01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:04.990
They're just murderous statues

1575
01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:10.790
look at you and wait and then what you'd do is you'd go to the store and get a

1576
01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:15.260
bag of Goldfish oh two and I can bring dude's over the house to watch feeding

1577
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:20.330
popcorn single man and then my friends over.
I'd like,
dude,
dude,
dude,

1578
01:33:20.331 --> 01:33:21.680
tonight's feet and time come on over.

1579
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:25.430
And I would go get a giant bag of goldfish and unleash it.

1580
01:33:25.431 --> 01:33:28.190
And at one point in time I think,
I don't know how many products I have,

1581
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.140
but it was more than one and it was a fucking rampage.
Every seen Pronto's mate.

1582
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:36.740
No.
What I would do not impede them.

1583
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:41.180
I would not feed them for like several days.
You gotta gotta time it.

1584
01:33:41.181 --> 01:33:44.960
Right because if you time it wrong they eat each other.
Okay,
well they'll,

1585
01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.550
they'll find the one who is the weekend.
You don't want to feed them every day,

1586
01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.580
but you want to feed him like every few days.
The key is like don't,

1587
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:56.330
don't get them to worry about when their next meal times just get it so that

1588
01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:59.360
they're hungry and then you put the goldfish in and you just watch the whole

1589
01:33:59.361 --> 01:34:02.990
water just turn red and no,
no,
no,
no.
They cut them in half.

1590
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:07.220
They swim in just one bite and then you'll see like the tail trying to swim away

1591
01:34:07.221 --> 01:34:10.070
by itself and then pump and the other one will take and swallow the channel in

1592
01:34:10.071 --> 01:34:15.071
one bite and they would just dissecting goldfish made heir to Tracy and they

1593
01:34:16.841 --> 01:34:20.530
don't even hurt.
They don't touch each other at all.
Right.
Wrong.

1594
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:25.460
Would leave at the end of feeding with chunks missing from their face.

1595
01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.780
Bite each other's faces in the middle of these ministers.
Just yours.

1596
01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:34.760
Maybe it's just your ones.
No,
no,
no.
Really Youtube videos of this tech camps.

1597
01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.810
Sure.
I'm sure people have it.
That's the rest of the,
my,

1598
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.760
the whole key with watching a Parana feed was just getting it hungry,
you know?

1599
01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.860
Because if I fed them every day,
I found out that they wouldn't even feed,

1600
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:46.970
they wouldn't even feed right away.

1601
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:50.240
I pour the goldfish in there and they'd look at them and then later

1602
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:55.220
when I was a kid,
I had a turtle.
So whatever turtle and you'd feed it.
Goldfish.

1603
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:59.150
Those are ruthless.
What are they?
All right,
dude.

1604
01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.080
The turtles are more ruthless than porosity.

1605
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:04.550
They nip your little fingers and stuff on this one.
One goldfish.

1606
01:35:04.551 --> 01:35:07.550
That was a feeder fish survived two fucking years.

1607
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:11.570
Lived with the turtle in the tank.
Endless rounds of other fish.

1608
01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:14.890
This one little tiny gold vision too.
They just were friends.
It was like,

1609
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.340
did you like or did you cry?
No,
I got rid of the promise.
You got rid of it.

1610
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:20.840
When you get rid of it,
you call this guy.

1611
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.090
This was decades ago and far past the

1612
01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:33.230
La River statute limits
what it is,
is you,
if you,

1613
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:36.020
um,
you got to just with an animal like that,

1614
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:38.600
first of all did the number one responsibility is to make sure it doesn't get

1615
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:39.434
out somewhere.

1616
01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:43.430
And that's where assholes have released these fucking things into other areas.

1617
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.360
That's largely illegal in Florida after Hurricane Andrew or those pet stores

1618
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:49.670
that had pythons and all those other fish and stuff,

1619
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:53.330
that's all like infested all the Florida,
they like to blame it on that,

1620
01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:54.680
but it's also just white trash

1621
01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.540
is the worst fucking place on earth.
It's not really America.

1622
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.230
I have been there and it wasn't my letting them leave.
They want to,

1623
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.600
I know that they want to go.
It's okay.

1624
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:07.970
They can get their shit together like any fucked up uncles.

1625
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.420
Like I hope he finds Iowasca guessing the therapy.

1626
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:15.890
Does Mtma fucking pull some stuff out of the ashes like the Phoenix?
He is,

1627
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:20.260
but the reality is giant percentage of Florida's filled with fucking idiot

1628
01:36:20.261 --> 01:36:22.910
phrase.
There's a lot of cool people in Florida.
I have friends in Florida.

1629
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:25.820
Nothing wrong with Florida as a whole,
but this guy does.

1630
01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:29.580
A lot of my parents live in Florida.
It's everyone goes to retire there,
Huh?
Yeah.

1631
01:36:29.581 --> 01:36:31.820
A lot of people love Florida.
It's good spots in Florida.

1632
01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:34.220
I love performing in Florida.
People are fine.
It's just,

1633
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.750
it's obviously not everybody,

1634
01:36:35.751 --> 01:36:39.200
but there's a giant percentage of fucking idiots there and they have those

1635
01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:41.330
pythons.
They just play.
He got too big,

1636
01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.460
so I'll figured I'd keep him out in the backyard and that was going to be on the

1637
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:49.180
fence.
But I came back,
he was gone.

1638
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.800
Now you gotta fucking 20 foot long pipes,
eaten horses and shit.

1639
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.340
The stables and swallowing people,

1640
01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:03.950
murderous fucking heartless monster is perfect for them.
Right?

1641
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:07.780
So they grow and grow and they've got no nobody,
no natural predators.
Yeah,

1642
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:12.020
they go bonkers.
Dangerous when any animal in Florida,
oh,

1643
01:37:12.021 --> 01:37:15.050
well they have the python exterminates even have contests,

1644
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.820
but the problem is they can't find them.

1645
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:19.910
You go out looking in the everglades and then they realize how big the fucking

1646
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:24.530
everglades are gone.
These things called camouflage too,

1647
01:37:24.531 --> 01:37:27.350
so they're good at that.
Yeah,
but they're not even from that area.

1648
01:37:27.351 --> 01:37:30.590
You would think that their colors wouldn't be,
I guess it's good enough.

1649
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:32.000
It's good enough,
but yeah,
I just think it's,

1650
01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:34.970
the everglades is so fucking funny as shit,

1651
01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:41.210
like three bodies out there and I'll finish.
That's fricking crazy.

1652
01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:44.600
You have to know there's a video of one getting the fucking alligator.
Yeah,

1653
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:48.920
a full video that I'll get a bit of a fight or is it like a sleep?
No,

1654
01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:53.690
it's fucking fighting.
The more they fight,
the more they constrict.
Right?
Pythons.

1655
01:37:53.691 --> 01:37:56.070
What they do is they grab a hold you and then you,
you're

1656
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.840
<v 1>heaving and you're exhaling,</v>

1657
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:03.210
inhaling and exhaling and when you exhale clamps down on you and then you try to

1658
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.290
breathe again and pay on the clamp down a little and it just cuts on the air
off.

1659
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:10.200
It's just game over that and the way it gets a hold of him.
It's like,

1660
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:15.000
it's so ruthless and roofing that alligator is the pictures of it.

1661
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.510
Video of it.
Jamie,
see if he can find the video.
It's incredible.

1662
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:20.970
It happened in Australia.
These people watched it all happen.

1663
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:23.550
So I guess it was actually a crocodile.
It was a python,

1664
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:26.880
because Australia doesn't have alligators and crocodiles are even more
dangerous.

1665
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.360
That's how gangster pythons are fucking awesome.

1666
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:37.080
What a fun one.
Eats a shark.
That's what in the world will not stop.
Yeah.
Well,

1667
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:41.670
you know what's interesting?
No cats kill the snakes.
Big,
big cats.

1668
01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:45.690
What's my little cat killed a fucking snake once it was Badass.
Yeah.

1669
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.820
They can kill snakes.
They know exactly what to do.

1670
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:50.190
They go right for the back of the head.
They're too fucking fast.

1671
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.460
Look at this shit.
This is the battle.
So this,

1672
01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:58.461
this python has wrapped around a god crocodile fricking,

1673
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.460
but that is a monster python.
The Monsanto Joe.

1674
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.110
And that's a small crocodile too.
That's a baby crocodile.
Nevertheless,

1675
01:39:07.111 --> 01:39:11.820
I say counted.
Yeah.
They seen any crocodiles?
A crocodile.
Well,
I mean,

1676
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:14.730
when I say little,
I think they said it was four foot.
Okay,

1677
01:39:14.731 --> 01:39:18.030
so that could bite your hand off big enough that I'm not getting anywhere near

1678
01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:21.600
my,
Oh damn.
You know,
it's swallowing its body.

1679
01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.190
It's expanding its mouth.

1680
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.810
Unhinging it's jaw and then it's whole body just slowly titrate up.

1681
01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:31.890
Head first.
[inaudible]
the crap out of that.

1682
01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:36.180
The lever Bros.
It's such a fucking ruthless world.

1683
01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:41.181
The world of nature and anybody who has a pet python is an asshole.

1684
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.850
Your craze,
your feet,

1685
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:48.630
you're keeping a monster in your house and the only reason why it's not killing

1686
01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:52.380
you is it because it's not big enough yet or it doesn't know that it has to or

1687
01:39:52.381 --> 01:39:56.940
wants to.
Once it decides,
what do you want to do?
If it's 20 feet long,

1688
01:39:56.941 --> 01:40:01.110
what the fuck are you going to do if at 20 foot long pilots in their house

1689
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:04.800
somewhere,
it's somewhere to some asshole has one guaranteed.

1690
01:40:04.801 --> 01:40:09.510
He's got some fucking patio goes out.
Three slip flops with tigers.
Yeah.

1691
01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.700
Well there was a documentary,
the elephant in the living room.
Did you see it?
No,

1692
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.990
me neither.
I was hoping you saw it.

1693
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:23.560
It's about people that keep exotic pets as a,
you know,
exotic animal,

1694
01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:26.750
wild animals as pets.
And it focused on that guy,
I think in,

1695
01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:29.670
in Ohio who had all these animals.
He want to kill himself,

1696
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:33.240
releasing all the animals,
then killing himself and all of these Mayans and shit.

1697
01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:35.160
We're wandering down the street and the cops did.

1698
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.180
The cops had a killer as a small town in Ohio.

1699
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.010
They can't like call in some animal experts by then.

1700
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:45.000
You lost track of your lines,
but they had to kill him on site.
But it's a really,

1701
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:48.720
apparently a fascinating documentary.
It's on my must watch list.

1702
01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:51.530
I'm going to try to fit in the living room.
Yeah.
Elephant,
the living room.

1703
01:40:51.531 --> 01:40:54.100
It's supposed to be pretty bad ass.
I'm watching it and next week

1704
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.270
<v 2>or come back,
I can't believe I recommended that piece of shit.</v>

1705
01:40:58.730 --> 01:41:02.110
Recommend something sight unseen and turns out to be fucking crap.

1706
01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.550
You know what car I hope but getting back to cars that uh,
they,

1707
01:41:07.551 --> 01:41:10.570
they keep around.
Is that Audi r eight?
They will,

1708
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:13.840
that thing is a quick sold enough of them that they'll continue to develop.

1709
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.420
I looked at that thing and I was like,
that thing hasn't changed.

1710
01:41:16.421 --> 01:41:18.760
Almost like a nine 11,
since the moment that they created it.

1711
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:20.740
It's just a little side.
Yeah.

1712
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.660
But still it drives a lot better than the,
than the V 10.
Uh,

1713
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:30.350
you know,
Lamborghinis doesn't really deal with on a daily basis too,

1714
01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.780
and that it has a gated shifter as well as going to say,

1715
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:36.370
still get it with a stick.
It's like one of the last cars with the gated shifter.

1716
01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.810
What does it like shifting just like the Ferrari's,
just like,

1717
01:41:40.811 --> 01:41:44.470
just like the little slower join it that way it's all shifting it.

1718
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:47.860
That would get click.
Click.
Yes.
Right,
right,
right.

1719
01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:50.700
That was what I was gonna settle that metal on metal.
It's delicious.

1720
01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.230
Like a little slower but a different kind of saddle overnight.

1721
01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.020
So it goes back to that thing like it's not about zero to 60 times,

1722
01:41:58.021 --> 01:42:01.290
it's about what does that Judy you while you're driving.
So you know what I mean?

1723
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.650
When you're planning grant charisma or when you're playing that shit,
man.

1724
01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:08.260
All right.
Sorry.
Dude out Rhonda.
Okay.
When you're playing out,
outrun.
Okay.

1725
01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.050
You remember finding out when you put it in the,

1726
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.960
in the automatic mode if you want it to advance in the game.
Oh,
okay.

1727
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:14.501
That's the game.

1728
01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:18.970
If the arcades you talk shit 87 okay.

1729
01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.080
I want to,
if you want to finish the game quickly,
get over to the next level,

1730
01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:26.380
get the better cars.
Yeah.
You put it in automatic mode.
Right.

1731
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.380
You would see you get,
it's easier,
but you know,

1732
01:42:29.381 --> 01:42:31.540
unless you're a paid race car driver on the track,

1733
01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:35.590
are you really having that much more fun by just holding the steering wheel and

1734
01:42:35.591 --> 01:42:39.250
pushing the gas pedal?
I have no problem with automatic transmissions.

1735
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.430
I just think they should help both because it was too many people that like it

1736
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:46.550
the other way.
There's too many people that are bemoaning the loss.
No,
I agree.

1737
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:47.381
It's got its place,

1738
01:42:47.381 --> 01:42:51.640
but I don't think the gt three was the place that was like the wrong place to

1739
01:42:51.641 --> 01:42:51.900
put it,

1740
01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:55.510
the chest and make a silly argument for it because there's still some cars like

1741
01:42:55.511 --> 01:42:58.780
a corvette Zr one in like a viper that have a stick that will beat it around a

1742
01:42:58.781 --> 01:43:02.920
track.
There's also that weird thing that automotive journalists too,

1743
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:08.170
when they go,
listen,
just go with the PDK.
Trust me,
I got a bunch of times.

1744
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:12.640
Don't feel stays better.
I'm guilty of that.
What?
What does that,

1745
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:13.750
what does that come from?
It was,

1746
01:43:13.751 --> 01:43:17.640
it was because Portia is seven speed shifters sucks.
Oh,
right there man.

1747
01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.380
I'd rather have a stick that have been paddles,

1748
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:22.750
but if the shifter isn't any good there's sort of no,

1749
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.720
but you're not being honest about that.
I think a lot of people are not honest.

1750
01:43:25.721 --> 01:43:28.960
The sad thing is that's like a $200 fix,
like in our parks

1751
01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.700
to make a Shitty,
you know like career shifter.
Yeah,

1752
01:43:33.701 --> 01:43:37.240
like linkages and bushings and so you could take one of those seven speeds and

1753
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:39.940
make it a good shift her.
Yeah,
I haven't done the seven speeds,

1754
01:43:39.941 --> 01:43:41.890
but the six speeds before it,
you know,
like the,

1755
01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:45.130
like a car asked to kind of throw a turbo that felt a little sloppy,
you know,

1756
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:49.990
it didn't feel as good as your gt three,
some better place.
Yeah.
But the,
um,

1757
01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:52.190
so what would you do about

1758
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.770
<v 1>that then?
You take the shift or I take the consol out.</v>

1759
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.140
So these seven speeds that they have now in the nine,
nine ones,

1760
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:00.560
you think you get upgrade that you can fix those two.
What would you have to do?

1761
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.900
Just take the console out,
take the shifter out.
You know,

1762
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:06.950
there's an American company Bnm you know,
I don't know.
He makes shifters,

1763
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.230
I mean you could probably,
you know,
retrofit.

1764
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.530
I think you can retrofit some of the,
uh,

1765
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:16.520
some of the linkages and stuff too from the older cars.
$25,000.
No,
no,
no.

1766
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.020
But you can never,
you know,
it's too bad you couldn't fit it like a,

1767
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.560
with a six speed,
you know,
cause I know that they,
I don't know why we need seven.

1768
01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:26.960
Yeah.
Need seven gears anyway.

1769
01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.380
Why not just make nine Porsches wind pretty high so that that seventh is really,

1770
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:36.240
really just for the car road trip.

1771
01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.680
If you're going to be just get on the highway and drive for five hours,

1772
01:44:39.681 --> 01:44:42.500
just stick the fucking thing in seventh and you'll get four or five miles a

1773
01:44:42.501 --> 01:44:44.740
gallon better.
Yeah,
I get that.
But still,

1774
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:47.690
I think they really wanted to hit that 30 miles a gallon number.

1775
01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:50.810
Carerra maybe they should have like a button overdrive,

1776
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.150
you know like old school put one of the foot buttons.

1777
01:44:54.151 --> 01:44:56.840
There's a little button on the side that's like road.

1778
01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:00.230
Did your COO to have one of those but the foot,
every row,

1779
01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.870
every beer had an overdrive.

1780
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.260
Was this body wanting that car didn't want it to be an automatic and they were

1781
01:45:06.261 --> 01:45:08.240
like,
it has to be an automatic.
You're like,

1782
01:45:08.241 --> 01:45:12.050
why can't I have a 1970 Barracuda automatic?

1783
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:14.450
What color was that car seller?
That was another thing.

1784
01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:17.120
The argument with me about it,
they wanted to paint it up like a Spanish hooker.

1785
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.790
Like I had to argue with them.
They wanted to put three different colors on it.

1786
01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:25.580
I was like,
wait a minute,
what do you
ghosted angels and slaves and stuff.

1787
01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.640
Now it's going to be silver on the bottom and then it's going to be black and it

1788
01:45:28.641 --> 01:45:33.230
was going to be red,
silver,
snow,
solar,
red,
and then black black on the hood,

1789
01:45:33.231 --> 01:45:37.840
like the old halyard hoods because chip Foose has this idea of a,
these designs.

1790
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:39.740
He gets him in his head.
Then that's what he wants to do.

1791
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:44.360
But then I saw it stripped down when they were,
they were sanding the body down.

1792
01:45:44.361 --> 01:45:48.230
It was all silver.
I was like,
oh,
that has to be all silver.
I was like,

1793
01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:50.510
I've never seen a silver Barracuda.
I want to see the silver Barracuda.

1794
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:53.090
And I was like,
let's do it on silver and all my God,

1795
01:45:53.091 --> 01:45:56.660
I had a fucking Duke it out with really there you're making a mixed drink.

1796
01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:00.440
I'm like,
how am I making a mistake?
Because you did you pay for that?
Oh yeah.
Oh,

1797
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:03.170
the answer is fuck you.
It's my mom.
A lot of money,
man.

1798
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:06.260
And it wasn't worth it in the,
in the long run it was um,

1799
01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.770
it was a car that was fun to look at and interesting and they did a great job

1800
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:12.970
building it,
don't get me wrong,
but how long did it take there?

1801
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:16.860
It's just a giant headache,
you know,
it was a lowered car.
So the,
the,

1802
01:46:16.861 --> 01:46:20.300
the back wheel well was tubbed and it was like four inches off the ground.

1803
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.800
So it was bottoming out everywhere.

1804
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:26.870
This is when this beautiful looking thing that is a very pretty car.
Very pretty.

1805
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.900
This is when I decided to get rid of it.
I was on the highway,

1806
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:34.970
I was coming home and I was going about,
you know,
normal speed,
highway speed,

1807
01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:36.690
60 70 miles an hour and a,

1808
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:41.330
I got off the highway 15 minutes later I'm at my house and I pulled into my

1809
01:46:41.331 --> 01:46:44.510
driveway and the car leans over to the right and the,

1810
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:47.240
the suspension had an airbag off.
No,

1811
01:46:47.241 --> 01:46:50.070
the suspension fallen off into the frame in

1812
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.780
<v 2>my driveway.
I was just on the highway 15 minutes ago going 70 miles an hour.</v>

1813
01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:58.980
So I said,
we're done here.
That's it.
So I called up Steve Stroop.

1814
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:03.120
You know Steve,
um,
pure vision,
great guy,
makes awesome cars,

1815
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.510
had them totally fix everything,
you know,
to the t,

1816
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.840
make sure everything's in order because maybe I'll drive it again,
maybe I won't.

1817
01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:12.190
Then I let it sit around for a year and then I just got rid of it.

1818
01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.760
I just didn't drive it again after that.
I was like,
I don't trust it.

1819
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.190
Trust in a car and stuff like you would like with your nine,
nine,
six turbo,

1820
01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:21.200
you lose trust.
Just let it go man.
It laminate.

1821
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:25.250
It also wasn't the car from me because I'm not a show car guy.
I'm not going to,

1822
01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.240
I wanted a car that could drive places.

1823
01:47:27.241 --> 01:47:29.400
I could shut it off and leave it there and then drive it again.

1824
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:31.380
Now that thing you've got to be worried about all the time,

1825
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:35.840
I totally approve of your,
of your curves and the roads that you go on.
I,

1826
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.790
I like that.
That's our style up there and then in nor cal.

1827
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:41.730
That's what we like to got rid of that.
And then I got a gt three with the money.

1828
01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:46.350
That's what I did.
And then I was like,
oh,
this better works so much better.

1829
01:47:46.410 --> 01:47:49.830
You know,
I don't a lot of that hand,
I have to drive a lot of this,

1830
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.550
this home built shit.
You know what I mean?
Bill literally,

1831
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.560
I drove a car last week,

1832
01:47:55.570 --> 01:48:00.570
had a couple of weeks ago there was seriously built by a fucking red neck by

1833
01:48:01.291 --> 01:48:04.290
himself over the course of six years.

1834
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.320
It was a 1975 Toyota Corolla with a supercharged v eight in it.

1835
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:15.000
Oh Man.
The God worked out like the car worked actually and was kind of,

1836
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.840
you know,
impressive.

1837
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.230
Cause the guy literally built it in his own little fucking universe and he had

1838
01:48:19.231 --> 01:48:23.430
nothing to compare it to.
He's never driven another real sports car and it made,

1839
01:48:23.431 --> 01:48:26.700
it's amazing.
The fucking wheels didn't fall off the thing.
Now you're alone.

1840
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:31.980
I know,
but that's like every week for me.
It's like some new crazy sketchy thing.

1841
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:36.570
It's never been tested.
Yeah.
I like from,
from our side,

1842
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:40.570
there's a lot of pressure like to,
you know,
like you said on top gear that Dutch,

1843
01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.800
a car manufacturer,
whatever the hell does.
Dan has that info.
Other Dana,
sorry.

1844
01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.680
Dangerous.
Yeah,
right.
Um,
I mean,
you know,

1845
01:48:47.730 --> 01:48:49.810
with all this sort of coverage and press we get like,

1846
01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.630
we better make sure the car is dialed.
Like we tested.

1847
01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:56.970
It doesn't work because I know,
you know,
I mean that shit blows up live.

1848
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.550
That's not going to be cool.
I know.
Driving it,
it blows up.

1849
01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:02.130
I just found out that x v Motor Sports,

1850
01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.270
they stopped making those dog challengers,
those crazy challenge.

1851
01:49:06.271 --> 01:49:10.530
They were charging 200 grand for something that wasn't worth 200 grand but

1852
01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:18.060
fucking bugs bunny.
Do you want to ask worth 1,000,006?
You know,

1853
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:21.390
what are these things worth these days?
What is worthwhile?
1.4 million.

1854
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:22.410
So I sold for,
yeah,

1855
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:27.230
if you could have a 1970 real 1970 challenge or actually handles well and breaks

1856
01:49:27.231 --> 01:49:29.330
well,
it might be worth super bird.

1857
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:34.060
That's what I wanted when I got that.
The Barracuda.

1858
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.910
The course you ended up with was a show car,

1859
01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:40.530
a show car that was just a little prissy little bitch and whine and complain and

1860
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:43.860
fucking shit out on me everywhere and left me stranded.

1861
01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:48.130
All these plants they killed.
You did.
But I made sure that I did

1862
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.600
<v 4>my due diligence and fixed it before I got rid of it.
I made,</v>

1863
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:55.450
I sued.
Fucking sued you.

1864
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:58.990
Imagine you sell a car and you find out dude racks it into a tree and it's brain

1865
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:00.850
dead now.
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1866
01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.950
I know the car to the guy who told him the very next day.
Wow.

1867
01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.400
I got cash.

1868
01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:10.810
I took his cash and bought a new fucking car and so have a nice day,
sir.

1869
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:14.020
Here's the spare key.
Would you like it?
What kind of car was it?

1870
01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:18.490
That was a Mustang.
Wow.
Was it a crazy car?
It was crazy for the time.

1871
01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.520
It was in 1984 and I had a stroker motor in it and I mean it was 400 horsepower

1872
01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:28.270
in 1997 was a lot.
Isn't it amazing?
That's what I'm saying.
400 horsepower.

1873
01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:32.170
Oh yeah,
yeah.
My,

1874
01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:37.120
my corvette when I built it in 2005,
500 horsepowers like holy shit.

1875
01:50:37.610 --> 01:50:39.190
One M that you were talking about,

1876
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:44.260
how much is that thing way 3,500 pounds.
So I said it's a fairly light,

1877
01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:47.230
it's about 500 pounds less than the [inaudible].
Right.

1878
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:52.640
The new m four is [inaudible] on four grand.
It's heavy.

1879
01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:57.780
Yeah.
There was a big article that Dan,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
no,
no.
The m four is the poop.

1880
01:50:57.810 --> 01:51:01.240
Yeah.
You can keep this shit straight.
BMW fucked up.

1881
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:03.860
<v 3>Like,
you know what the other thing too is remember your nine nine six turbo,</v>

1882
01:51:03.861 --> 01:51:04.730
right?
So I was telling you,

1883
01:51:04.731 --> 01:51:09.260
my buddies in Arizona that worked with us on all this stuff.
Um,
they have a,

1884
01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:12.260
you know,
1600 horsepower,
nine nine seven turbo,

1885
01:51:12.261 --> 01:51:15.950
which is essentially the same engine,
right as a parachute on the by machine.

1886
01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:20.210
You drove this thing and he drove it.
It's just crazy.
Right?
So in that same car,

1887
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:23.600
I mean,
they drive those things so fast that those mile events that,
you know,

1888
01:51:23.601 --> 01:51:28.330
when they get to like two 30 to 40 miles an hour,
the roof caves in the Sunroof,

1889
01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.293
just

1890
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:30.630
<v 4>when I drove it,
I hit,</v>

1891
01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.080
I hit I think one 75 or one 18 and the windows started peeling out away from the

1892
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:40.910
doorframe.
Oh my God.
When you see like a red 970 [inaudible] I'm driving,

1893
01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.840
you can't drive.
You know,
you,

1894
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:46.470
you could show up somewhere now and an event with a car that's a thousand

1895
01:51:46.471 --> 01:51:49.280
horsepower.
And of course any normal person who,

1896
01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.810
if anyone is still listening to this that cares about a thousand word spreads

1897
01:51:51.811 --> 01:51:56.570
are amazing.
But you know,
it'd be like,
well,
I've got 1500 horsepower.

1898
01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:59.220
Like the Internet has fucked it up completely.

1899
01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.740
The Internet fucked it up because the Internet,
all you,

1900
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:05.010
you couldn't just go and get into that.
You know,

1901
01:52:05.011 --> 01:52:09.870
you can see some fucking psycho in Dubai who's got some super with 1500

1902
01:52:09.871 --> 01:52:14.220
horsepower and all of a sudden that is reset your barometer for normal.

1903
01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.420
Normal is the,
is the big numbers you see on the Internet.
Now,

1904
01:52:18.421 --> 01:52:19.740
not most of these people,

1905
01:52:19.741 --> 01:52:23.500
if they wrote in a 500 horsepower car would shit their pants,
but,

1906
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:27.990
but they see on the internet some psycho with a dyno car,
you know,

1907
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:32.520
putting down 1500 and they go,
boof,
if yours doesn't make 1500 it ain't shit.

1908
01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:35.940
Isn't that interesting when it comes to a lot of fans of cars that can't afford

1909
01:52:35.941 --> 01:52:39.140
those cars that have kits to a haterade.
Yeah,

1910
01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.510
but it also gets that weird thing like you're shitting on a car that you can't

1911
01:52:42.511 --> 01:52:44.190
afford.
You don't even know what the fuck it would be like.

1912
01:52:44.490 --> 01:52:47.320
Why the bronze medalist to this theory,

1913
01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.350
you're dealing with the demon of a car.

1914
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:55.880
You're talking about like the evo top 10 when they do the top 10 of the best

1915
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:58.820
supercars in the year for the best sports cars or whatever it would ever,

1916
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:01.460
performance cars is the category and like the shittiest one,

1917
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:05.050
it's still pretty fucking good song or demonic vehicles.
You know,

1918
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:09.980
you're dealing with things that defy logic.
Like if you drive the Porsche us.

1919
01:53:09.981 --> 01:53:12.860
Yeah.
There's people that argue with us and we know.
So we'll,

1920
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:15.560
we'll go film a car like on the press lodge,

1921
01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:20.180
like the car won't be insurance for six months and we'll go film this car months

1922
01:53:20.181 --> 01:53:24.410
before it comes out.
And people will argue about how good or bad it is.

1923
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:29.390
Literally.
No,
there's no possible way that they actually have this information.

1924
01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:33.590
It's not possible.
The transmission has issues for of the guys who work at tech.

1925
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:38.240
No fucking shit.
I know an insight
drove it.

1926
01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:41.170
I mean a lot of people that haven't driven,
um,
you know,

1927
01:53:41.171 --> 01:53:44.990
a career gt before have all these opinions about it being super dangerous.

1928
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:47.300
And it's like,
no,
it,
it,
it's not,

1929
01:53:47.301 --> 01:53:49.610
it's how you drive it and also what tires you have.

1930
01:53:49.611 --> 01:53:53.180
And I mean it's known for being a little hairy.
That's quite a mix of Keel.

1931
01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:56.450
It's part of the appeal.
And will you guys were enlightening me about the uh,

1932
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:58.590
the Paul Walker car that uh,

1933
01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:02.610
that killed him and his or his friend that they were nine year old tires.
Yeah.

1934
01:54:03.170 --> 01:54:07.800
So what happens when you have a collector car like that?
A car that is a top t,

1935
01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:09.420
you'll see a lot of these Ferrari.

1936
01:54:09.421 --> 01:54:14.150
Enzo is these top tier collector cars where people will buy him and not put many

1937
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:18.980
miles on it.
So Roger who was driving the car when,
when Roger and Paul died,

1938
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:23.120
bought this car for his collection,
he's a huge collection of cars,

1939
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.640
bought this car for his collection.
He had been sitting there,

1940
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:29.720
he was gunna put tires on it.
But,
but Paul was like,

1941
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:31.550
Oh let me just go for a ride around the block.

1942
01:54:31.551 --> 01:54:35.660
And they just went for a ride around the block.
But because rubber and tires,

1943
01:54:35.661 --> 01:54:38.570
whether you drive on them or not will become very hard over time.

1944
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:42.350
So it might look like a nice tire with tread,
you know,

1945
01:54:42.351 --> 01:54:44.840
like it looks more or less like a brand new tire.

1946
01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:49.310
But that rubber has been slowly hardening and and it and uh,
tires,

1947
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:52.880
contact patch with the ground is partially about the tread pattern,

1948
01:54:52.881 --> 01:54:56.420
but more importantly it's a chemical bond with,
with tarmac.

1949
01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.190
And so as the tire ages,
that becomes much less effective.
You lose traction on.

1950
01:55:01.191 --> 01:55:04.850
Also like tires from the 2004 error,
you know,
they weren't,

1951
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:06.320
they weren't as good as they are now.

1952
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:10.130
The missions that they wouldn't put on are way,
way grippier stickier.
Yeah,

1953
01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:14.550
a cup tires.
He's a these gt three cup car tires that are on there.

1954
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:16.850
They're insane.
Yeah.
I think once they get hot,

1955
01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.080
they are once you sticky thing that folks need to understand.
Like when you,

1956
01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:25.130
if you're driving a car,
you can't skimp on tires ever.
We'll also,

1957
01:55:25.131 --> 01:55:27.320
you can't just drive it fast right away.

1958
01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:29.540
You can't just take your mark started out your driveway,

1959
01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:33.080
go right to the race track and just,
you know,
you're laughing.

1960
01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:35.860
But see a lot of people would go,
what's so funny?
Yeah,

1961
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:39.630
you got it with the closer to a racing tire it is and where he got it.

1962
01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:42.980
So what do you do if you go to,
if you're a guy and this your first day,

1963
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:43.900
the track and see if you've

1964
01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:49.140
<v 3>ever you a formula one race,
that lap right before they start.
What they do is,</v>

1965
01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.320
you know,
they're going about 10 miles an hour,
10 to 20 miles an hour,

1966
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:55.790
and they're going left and right.
Left and right in the tires.
Yeah,

1967
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.620
and that's what you do.
You do like,
uh,
you don't,

1968
01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.500
you don't have to do that because then you look like you're a foster driver and

1969
01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:02.400
that's kind of stupid,

1970
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.340
<v 2>but can't they put magnets all around?</v>

1971
01:56:04.341 --> 01:56:08.270
The tires are at an all were on the cars itself or I'll run the bumpers and put

1972
01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:11.180
magnets on all the other cars too.
Oh,
that way when they get near each other,

1973
01:56:11.810 --> 01:56:14.150
never actually touch.
That'd be nice.

1974
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:17.200
Super powered Matt Bowling,

1975
01:56:17.201 --> 01:56:21.740
but on a race and have the magnets powered by the same electrical engine that

1976
01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:22.600
does like the 19th

1977
01:56:22.730 --> 01:56:25.220
<v 3>we know like when you were driving on your road today,
for example,
right.</v>

1978
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:27.200
You kind of eased into it.
You kind of,

1979
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.570
you didn't go like balls out when you didn't go balls out anyway,

1980
01:56:29.571 --> 01:56:30.740
but you know what I mean?
You,
you went,

1981
01:56:31.190 --> 01:56:34.820
you went steady pace and then you kind of went foster and foster,
right.

1982
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.040
You'd let some heat in the tires.
You let things get settled.
Yeah.

1983
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:41.240
You don't just go like 10 10 so those are always the guys that crashed on the

1984
01:56:41.241 --> 01:56:43.520
first corner of a track on their first day.

1985
01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.010
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
I'm not a great driver,</v>

1986
01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:49.240
but I know how to drive a car and the good thing you are,
I grew up in Boston,

1987
01:56:49.241 --> 01:56:52.750
so I drove on snowy weather all the time.

1988
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:55.070
Boston has a shitty roads man,

1989
01:56:55.071 --> 01:56:58.990
and they were rough roads and I was a newspaper delivery guy for like five
years.

1990
01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.430
So I drove 365 days a year.
I drove every fucking day.

1991
01:57:03.431 --> 01:57:07.270
That's crazy.
Knowing,
reigning,
move over and over,
over and over.

1992
01:57:07.271 --> 01:57:10.010
And over here I'll trow hills and down,
sliding in,

1993
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:13.430
intersections over the roof tossed.
Yep.

1994
01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:17.830
I did over the rooftops and you windows.
I broke everything I would roll down,

1995
01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:21.280
rolled down the passenger window.
I could hook it that way.
I was good with that.

1996
01:57:21.281 --> 01:57:25.090
I would occasionally go with the loop,
the sky,
but lefthanded man,

1997
01:57:25.091 --> 01:57:26.680
if I could drive down the street,

1998
01:57:26.681 --> 01:57:29.050
it was early in the morning and I knew no cars were coming in the other

1999
01:57:29.051 --> 01:57:33.670
direction.
I would just go in the left lane and just fucking whip laugh.
Yeah,

2000
01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:36.970
I have,
I have a good route,
you know,
as long as they're in plastic,

2001
01:57:36.971 --> 01:57:41.580
they're going to be fine.
You fold them up or Nick Thompson bands.
Yeah.

2002
01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.510
You had to bag and then taught you.

2003
01:57:43.511 --> 01:57:46.420
What you do is you would hang the plastic bags from your rear view mirror.

2004
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:49.210
So you've got a rear view mirror,
you tie the plastic bags off,

2005
01:57:49.211 --> 01:57:53.140
it's on like this cardboard strip and there's like a sheet of plastic bags.

2006
01:57:53.141 --> 01:57:55.300
Like there might be like 50 or a hundred bags.
Right.

2007
01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:58.780
So then the newspapers just stacked up on your passenger seat and as you're

2008
01:57:58.781 --> 01:58:01.210
driving you got to learn how to steer with your knees,
cause you going real slow.

2009
01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:04.930
You take the newspaper,
you'd grab it,
funk,
funk fest,
the fold.

2010
01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:08.230
One left one,
right?
Bam.
I got it.

2011
01:58:08.231 --> 01:58:13.120
And now it's like a third of a newspaper stuffing in that bag out the window.

2012
01:58:13.121 --> 01:58:18.121
And I'm telling you I'm going to get our foam foam foam muscle memory's still

2013
01:58:18.221 --> 01:58:20.140
get the muscle memory is still flowing right now.

2014
01:58:20.141 --> 01:58:23.770
Get pissed if I was fucking around with this all you bitch and then I hit the

2015
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:27.830
brakes and fun.
And you didn't have our compound tires on that bad boy.
I didn't.

2016
01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:28.511
No,
no,
no.

2017
01:58:28.511 --> 01:58:33.511
After awhile I invested in a gigantic cargo van with no windows free candy Van

2018
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:37.630
van.
Huh?
I could pack that bitch with newspapers.

2019
01:58:37.631 --> 01:58:42.130
I got this van for like 500 bucks and ready to go.
Re Up today I get a thousand

2020
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.870
<v 4>newspapers on Sunday in his van.
It was a good Sunday sometimes,</v>

2021
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:49.930
you know,
it wouldn't really be a thousand.

2022
01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:54.850
I think the most I had was 450 clients.
That was the most I ever had.

2023
01:58:54.851 --> 01:58:57.880
It would take hours,
boast too much,
cause I was doing the Boston Herald,

2024
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.300
the Boston Globe and the New York Times.
I had three routes at the same time.

2025
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:06.660
Yeah,
I was driving in the fucking snow daily Sun.

2026
01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:09.820
And you said it was hard for me to drive with a camera right in front of my face

2027
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:12.670
holding newspapers while driving with your knees sounds just as hard.

2028
01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:17.320
You probably weren't sober and there's no one in the road.
Yes.
Five o'clock,

2029
01:59:17.321 --> 01:59:22.200
no more than a foot away from the car in front.
And I was pretty skillful driver.

2030
01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:24.940
Very.
It was very impressive in the rain.

2031
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.840
A foot away from fucking in front of Joe.
I had Joe come with me in the car,

2032
01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:34.870
go,
come,
come check it up.
And I'm driving his car,
him in the passenger seat.

2033
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:38.910
Zack is driving my van and we're fucking,
you know,
tail.

2034
01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:41.980
That's what we do is I don't tailgate the van.
It's ridiculous.

2035
01:59:41.981 --> 01:59:45.180
How close to death.
I mean,
I know I was with the driver.
I was,
no,
that's good.

2036
01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.120
Well,
whoa.
Nerve wracking.
I mean,
I know you guys have it down to a science.

2037
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:53.020
You know what the fuck are we do?
We bugged people out,
whatever they,
they,
uh,

2038
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:57.000
they see us do something like,
like,
wait a minute,
this doesn't,

2039
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:59.200
the videos don't look nearly this sketchy.

2040
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:04.510
Usually to see what we didn't want at night.
And we had the fan with lights,

2041
02:00:04.570 --> 02:00:06.340
Suction Cup to the back of the van,

2042
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:11.530
a running gas generator in the back of the van while doing that.

2043
02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:17.160
And I'm driving an APP running gas in the van on fire.

2044
02:00:17.531 --> 02:00:19.750
It's like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That is crazy.

2045
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:24.780
And then I'm driving behind the van with directly into these 400 watt lights in

2046
02:00:25.901 --> 02:00:29.980
an Aston Martin,
a foot off the bumper at fucking night.
Oh my God.

2047
02:00:29.981 --> 02:00:31.900
That is ridiculous.
It's really sketchy.

2048
02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:35.530
Permits for this insurance allegedly,
allegedly,

2049
02:00:35.531 --> 02:00:40.270
allegedly allegedly were testing equipment to see your learning.

2050
02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:42.550
Camera's on while we were testing set equipment,

2051
02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:45.250
except that we have to have proof of our testing in order to get paid.

2052
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.180
We haven't have $400,000 in Porsche's and TV celebrity.

2053
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:52.630
We're just testing equipment,

2054
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.620
just screaming this car that he's got this 4.1 liter,

2055
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:59.860
560 horsepower,
is that what it is?

2056
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.620
Five 45 40 whatever the fuck it is.

2057
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:08.350
It's a screaming monster and you hear it literally three quarters of a mile

2058
02:01:09.101 --> 02:01:10.910
away.
Really far worse.

2059
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:16.570
Alex and I were were waiting and while you were going on your first wild ride

2060
02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.540
and we were like,
here,
you hear it and you were nowhere.

2061
02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.750
Wow.
That's really good.
It's a great,
it was so loud.

2062
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:33.630
It was rounding corners and gt three voice now is good.

2063
02:01:33.631 --> 02:01:35.530
It's really dope fucking car,
man.

2064
02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:40.100
You make that noise while you're driving your own car in the shower.
You're

2065
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:43.820
<v 2>fucking shifting and shit.
It's like singing along.
It's like Karaoke.
Do it again.</v>

2066
02:01:43.821 --> 02:01:46.520
Can I get,
can I get a full lap of a Nurburg ring right here?

2067
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:57.370
It's fucking good man.
Right?
All the skills that you could acquire in this alive,

2068
02:01:58.510 --> 02:02:03.100
making noises to like cars is fucking the top of the list.
A lot of time I spent,

2069
02:02:03.130 --> 02:02:04.870
I worked hard.
It's like video game skills.

2070
02:02:04.871 --> 02:02:07.180
It's like being good at everquest doesn't really,

2071
02:02:07.210 --> 02:02:10.060
there's the guy who does the car noises in the soda can.
Have you seen that one?

2072
02:02:10.150 --> 02:02:13.750
Minnesota.
Karen?
Yeah.
The guy who makes a Lamborghini noises and the soda can.

2073
02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:17.470
It's,
it's fairly awesome actually.
It makes sense.
Yeah,
it's tinny.

2074
02:02:17.610 --> 02:02:18.443
Are you doing it?

2075
02:02:22.090 --> 02:02:26.750
That sounds like work mode.
More like a viper.
Viper dude.
Too much coffee now.

2076
02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.420
I'm crazy.
For years it was the only the other good songs,

2077
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.300
but they're only good sound that I do that it really sounds real as a dog.

2078
02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.001
And when we were,

2079
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:37.750
at one time we were on fear factor and a bunch of people were waiting to do this

2080
02:02:37.751 --> 02:02:39.730
stuff and they were blindfolded.

2081
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:42.860
They'd move them in and blindfolds because they had to get their camera position

2082
02:02:42.861 --> 02:02:44.800
set up.
Yeah.
So they had no idea what the stone would be.

2083
02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:46.300
So as these people moving in,
I'm going,

2084
02:02:50.670 --> 02:02:52.650
they're sitting there going,
Oh gee,

2085
02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.680
I'm going to like moving really slowly.
Wow.

2086
02:02:58.750 --> 02:03:03.190
That's fucking creepy.
Is next to you?
It's creepy.
Have you seen total blackout?

2087
02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.060
What does that Julio White Show Jaleel white or no,

2088
02:03:08.110 --> 02:03:12.250
he got a show.
What kind of show?
So it's called total blackout.
Right.

2089
02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.000
So then you're laughing,
you're ready.
They got people to come in and they,

2090
02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:20.620
and they make them go and pitch black rooms and do shit with their hands in

2091
02:03:20.621 --> 02:03:24.400
pitch black.
So it's like,
guess what they're touching in pitch black room.

2092
02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:27.920
So some,
you know,
some of it will be fucking spiders and bullshit,

2093
02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:32.380
you know what I mean?
But they'll rub a sweaty fat man,

2094
02:03:32.381 --> 02:03:35.140
you know what I mean?
Like,
and so,
uh,

2095
02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:39.460
it's generally people freak out over some dumb shit.

2096
02:03:39.461 --> 02:03:41.530
So that just kind of fucking got me on that.

2097
02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:43.810
I don't know why there's no point to it actually,

2098
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:48.610
but it's fucking host a big giant dude.
No,
no,

2099
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.470
isn't it?
Oh,
the other guy will size Urkel brother.
Oh,
Eddie went,
eh,
no,

2100
02:03:53.471 --> 02:03:56.750
it's anyone circles brother.
Even though brother.
Yeah.
He had a brother didn't,

2101
02:03:56.751 --> 02:04:01.020
he didn't nerve Glover brother.
No,
there was a family.
There was no,
no,

2102
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:05.710
I don't think he got a brother.
He was like the lone Bieber Shit.

2103
02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:09.560
I'm so bad on my old school,
1990 sitcoms,

2104
02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:12.190
people lose their fucking mind when they can't see shit.

2105
02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:14.740
I'm sure you're well aware of.
Oh yeah.
Well,

2106
02:04:14.741 --> 02:04:17.740
I'm a big fan of the sensory deprivation tank and I'm always getting them one of

2107
02:04:17.741 --> 02:04:21.160
those things.
Well,
the show that you were doing,
the x factor stuff,

2108
02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.470
so the fear factor ketchup's sorry,
I didn't want it to Dennis.
No,

2109
02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:28.990
I haven't met fear.
Fact.
What do they charge for that?
40 bucks for an hour.

2110
02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:31.780
For an hour and a half?
I think so the uh,
the British version,

2111
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:35.680
the brewsters in Hammond was during that fear fact.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2112
02:04:35.681 --> 02:04:39.060
I just thought it was cool because he has,
he has a gt three,
so Sgt.
Three guys.

2113
02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:43.300
That's hilarious.
He started doing it after I started doing the u s version.
Yeah.

2114
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:46.230
Yeah.
There was a bunch of different hosts,
a fear factor,
like all over the world.

2115
02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.980
I mean,
how weird.
Yeah.
But that's not crazy.
He's got it.
He had a gt three Rs.

2116
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:50.814
You have a gt.

2117
02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:56.140
We're both short and the coincidence is go on,

2118
02:04:56.150 --> 02:05:01.040
on mildly amusing.
This is insane.
Yeah.

2119
02:05:01.730 --> 02:05:05.120
I gotta Hook up that tank.
Yeah.
Well you should definitely,
you would love it.

2120
02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.650
It's very relaxing to,

2121
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:09.830
I did one like 10 years ago and I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

2122
02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:13.970
Why didn't you do it again?
Because I don't live in the state in which I did it.

2123
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:15.250
Right.

2124
02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:18.080
I didn't have work around it yet and haven't gotten around to checking it out

2125
02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:20.720
there.
Opening up.
Now it's become a popular thing again.

2126
02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:25.460
Is it all over the country?
What are the preferred drug?
Sensory deprivation.

2127
02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:32.750
He's your friend.
Especially edible.
Okay.
Yeah.
You go the edible route.

2128
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:35.030
Get to the point where you think you're probably going to be the first guy to

2129
02:05:35.031 --> 02:05:38.470
dive and overdose,
right,

2130
02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:42.890
right on heaven's door and you want to get white like you're fucking Eric

2131
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:46.180
Clapton Song,
knock,
knock,
knock.
One of those,

2132
02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:50.210
one of those hundred 80 milligrams,
she would choose right to the

2133
02:05:51.850 --> 02:05:54.830
those Chiba Chews.
As you're eating them,

2134
02:05:54.831 --> 02:05:59.600
you started hallucinating and you said see vapor trails near your lips as you're

2135
02:05:59.601 --> 02:06:03.290
chewing,
you don't want to eat too much.
She would.
She,
it's so easy to it.

2136
02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.820
I was just fucking centimeter.

2137
02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:09.710
I was on a plane with Joey d is okay and Joey Diaz had already eaten one,

2138
02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:13.120
a full one,
and I go,
how much should I have to go?

2139
02:06:13.121 --> 02:06:17.950
Don't even need more than a half a full one.
It puts it in his mouth.
I go,
Ugh,

2140
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.900
you had one earlier.
It goes,
this is my third one.

2141
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.220
It goes one to fucking six hour flight.
Uncle Joey's going deep.

2142
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:31.160
He told me don't even need a half,
and he ate three of them.
Was He fucked?

2143
02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:35.240
Oh,
he didn't say nothing,
but we,
we landed.
He goes,

2144
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:38.930
I almost had a fucking panic open that door and jumped out.

2145
02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.580
I almost was going to tell the lady as the plane was taking off,

2146
02:06:43.581 --> 02:06:44.780
I'm not going to fucking do it.

2147
02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:50.200
I'm not doing this and that with Ari Shaffir once I gave him a breast trip and

2148
02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:54.890
while we're waiting to take off,
he starts clinching,
does the or I go,
what?

2149
02:06:54.891 --> 02:06:57.260
And he was nothing.
And then when we landed,
he goes,

2150
02:06:57.261 --> 02:06:59.330
I was going to get up and I was going to tell him to stop the plane.

2151
02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:05.360
He goes,
yes,
I was going to tell him to stop applying.
Kept so lie.

2152
02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:07.290
Who's didn't tell him to stop the play.

2153
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:11.090
You had a friend in town and there was a little mixed cube miscommunication.

2154
02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:14.330
We gave him a couple edibles and we didn't make it very,

2155
02:07:14.331 --> 02:07:18.500
very clear that you will need one at a time.
Oh those three,
those three cookies.

2156
02:07:18.501 --> 02:07:23.501
He ate it once right before having an epic meltdown and puking on this fucking,

2157
02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:29.750
it's good.
You can really hurt yourself.
You really pull something,

2158
02:07:30.130 --> 02:07:34.970
you know you can fit.
50 milligrams is my maximum and that's,

2159
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:35.890
that's high.

2160
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:39.250
<v 4>50 milligrams is very,
it is a biggie dose.</v>

2161
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:42.670
They sell the gold caps in 50s now and it's like whoa.

2162
02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:46.600
Well those candies who you ate a candy,
right?
This kid

2163
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:52.810
that was a good dose.
Cause the jolly ranchers,
they're like,
one of them is like,

2164
02:07:52.811 --> 02:07:55.630
you know,
a nice mellow too fucked up.

2165
02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:59.020
You can kind of get through it and two of them,
Ooh,
you're gonna feel tingles.

2166
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:03.310
Two of them.
You've got to be like,
I might have just fucked up.
And I said second,

2167
02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:07.670
that second one.
But if you,
if you really want to go crazy,

2168
02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:10.330
the Chiba chews or the really,
really gnarly.

2169
02:08:10.450 --> 02:08:12.610
I was gonna say that she would choose,
it's probably like five of those.

2170
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:15.580
That's how strong a Chiba chew is.
It's like five of those.

2171
02:08:15.581 --> 02:08:17.840
When I first saw that and he said 180 milligrams,

2172
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:21.160
like there's no way they could sell this to somebody give a fuck.

2173
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.030
They know that this is a market.
They know there's a market out there.
We have,

2174
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:27.430
I mean,
have you come across dabs yet?

2175
02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.610
DABS or I don't fuck around with that stuff too.
It's too,
it's too much.

2176
02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.690
Everybody's going too deep.

2177
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:33.550
You go into deep and you don't even know what's down there.

2178
02:08:34.570 --> 02:08:37.480
You're going to the Marianas trench and fucking Godzilla's taking a shit.

2179
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:41.890
I Dunno.
Doing dabs.
Yeah,
he's not.

2180
02:08:41.891 --> 02:08:45.430
Could you imagine being highest fuck at the bottom of the ocean and also being a

2181
02:08:45.431 --> 02:08:46.540
billionaire at the same time?

2182
02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.840
What am I doing down so much money and it just send a fucking camera down here.

2183
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:56.650
I've got the exact same thing.
It's crazy.
James Cameron is.

2184
02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.050
Think about how crazy is.
He's got at least a billion dollars,

2185
02:08:59.051 --> 02:08:59.950
probably Middle East,

2186
02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:04.420
and he's built a fucking submarine if go to the lowest point and become the

2187
02:09:04.421 --> 02:09:08.030
first guy to do it.
The best quote from James when in the,

2188
02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:12.630
in the month of this searching for the plane,
the Malaysia,
Malaysia plane,

2189
02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:15.970
you know,
they're looking,
they're looking for it.
So someone asked James Cameron,

2190
02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:18.460
what do you think?
How do we,
you know,
you're into this shit.

2191
02:09:18.461 --> 02:09:21.790
How do we find the fucking plane?
Right?
And he's talking about,
he actually,

2192
02:09:21.791 --> 02:09:26.020
it was on reddit and he actually did like a very thorough explanation of how one

2193
02:09:26.021 --> 02:09:29.260
would go about searching for the plane.
And he actually was like,

2194
02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:32.350
you don't need my submarine because my submarine is,

2195
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:36.370
it's two to march too much for this mission.

2196
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.090
You back it off one and use that.
That's hilarious.

2197
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:45.100
Worst sub than James Cameron has in order to find a missing plane,

2198
02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:46.390
which hasn't been found yet,

2199
02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:51.460
but isn't it impossible to find something in the ocean if the plane is just the

2200
02:09:51.461 --> 02:09:55.460
size of a plane not discovered in the last few years?
You know what I mean?

2201
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:59.890
That shit's gone.
I mean,
how could you find it?
It would.

2202
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.940
You have to get really lucky.
Yeah,
right.
They found the fucking titanic,

2203
02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:08.440
but it looks like a long time long.
It only took them 80 years,

2204
02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:13.390
so 80 73 [inaudible] 74 years.
Bob Ballard,

2205
02:10:13.391 --> 02:10:17.530
1986 seven it wasn't really,
that is a crazy,
but they knew that.

2206
02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.430
That's true.
That's a good point.

2207
02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.740
They made movies about raising the titanic before they found it.
Remember that?

2208
02:10:23.741 --> 02:10:24.730
And it goes up.
My mother,

2209
02:10:26.250 --> 02:10:30.350
they tied a bunch of fucking lift bags at work.
Yeah,

2210
02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:33.500
it did.
It did work.

2211
02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.410
<v 1>There's this,
there's this podcast that I listened to all the time.</v>

2212
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:44.180
It's called radio lab and it's a great podcast,
Radiolab from NYC W NYC,

2213
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:48.770
and they had this episode on a Glo Mar Response and the Glo Mar responses,

2214
02:10:48.771 --> 02:10:51.770
I can neither confirm nor deny.
You know,
everybody uses that all the time.

2215
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:56.830
It came from global marine and global marine was a company that was hired to try

2216
02:10:57.591 --> 02:11:01.820
to retrieve a sunken Russian submarine,
and this was right after Watergate.

2217
02:11:01.821 --> 02:11:05.180
This is the 1970s so because everybody was really sensitive about lies,

2218
02:11:05.181 --> 02:11:07.010
the freedom of Information Act to come about,

2219
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:09.080
and it gotten to a point where they were,

2220
02:11:09.081 --> 02:11:13.610
they were forced to to talk and discuss about what they were doing out there in

2221
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:16.820
the ocean or are you actually trying to retrieve a rest and Russian submarine?

2222
02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:18.920
Did you retrieve a Russian something?
And they said,

2223
02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.110
we can neither confirm nor deny.

2224
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:24.830
And that had become because of that glo mar response.

2225
02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:28.790
That's like a standard phrase now.
So they had to try to figure out,

2226
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.300
they were forced by law to respond and to give information.

2227
02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:33.440
So that was what they,

2228
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:37.370
that was the information they get that they can neither confirm nor deny signed

2229
02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.540
it.
What do you think?
Oh yeah,
they found it.
They were not only they find it,

2230
02:11:41.541 --> 02:11:43.670
they almost pulled it up.
They had,

2231
02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:47.840
they attached this giant claw to a huge ship and they were trying to pick this

2232
02:11:47.841 --> 02:11:48.620
thing up

2233
02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:53.610
<v 2>fucking thing that gets toys.
Yeah,
they work just as well.</v>

2234
02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:57.540
[inaudible] halfway up and then it broke off kind of an Ipod Nano fuck.

2235
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.130
Like a fluffy little bunny or something.

2236
02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:05.270
It was miles deep miles deep in the ocean and they got ahold of it and they got

2237
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:08.990
it on film and they were watching it as they're bringing it up.
But the feedback,

2238
02:12:08.991 --> 02:12:11.630
the loop from watching it delayed,

2239
02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:16.420
so they felt this thump and then they looked at the film and all fill in the

2240
02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:18.200
showed that the boat was still there.

2241
02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.830
So then they refresh the feed and the boat was gone.

2242
02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.550
They were like dropped it basically dropped it back to the bottom of boats,

2243
02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:28.630
millions and millions and millions of pounds and they're calling it with a
phone,

2244
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:30.000
the little Carney cloth.

2245
02:12:32.530 --> 02:12:35.030
You gotta love that optimism though.
They really thought they probably,

2246
02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.350
well they came close.
They did lift it up off the ground and got it a mile up.

2247
02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:44.540
They brought it pretty fucking far up before it broke on live video of it just

2248
02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:49.550
breaking free.
We millions and millions and millions of dollars,

2249
02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.510
but they upenn apparently eventually they got it.
I don't know.

2250
02:12:52.610 --> 02:12:53.960
I think Ballard had to do the same,

2251
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:56.280
like he had to find a whole bunch of submarines.

2252
02:12:56.281 --> 02:12:59.450
And do this stuff for the government.
And this titanic thing was a side thing.

2253
02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:03.290
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure that's how a lot of the Skimm,
what?
Isn't it fun when they,

2254
02:13:03.291 --> 02:13:03.440
uh,

2255
02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:08.440
they find these sunken boats from like the Roman era full of someone just found

2256
02:13:10.071 --> 02:13:12.170
$10 million in your back yard.

2257
02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:16.970
California gold coins and someone in the fucking 18 hundreds.

2258
02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:20.690
Berea backyard.
Crazy.
Did you have to give it back or whatever?

2259
02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.950
But I did read the head to pay taxes on it.
Oh God.
Government second.

2260
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:30.510
[inaudible] gold.

2261
02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:32.100
How can you pay taxes on

2262
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:32.933
<v 1>gold?</v>

2263
02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:38.240
Cause Lesley figured out that it was owed in 1898 if they sold it,

2264
02:13:39.670 --> 02:13:42.210
maybe they pay type of man.
That should be how you're,

2265
02:13:42.211 --> 02:13:46.390
you're free and away from taxes.
Only about money.
I,

2266
02:13:46.810 --> 02:13:50.280
I may have misconstrued the story is some analysts said if they ever sold it,

2267
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:52.800
they would have to pay taxes or blah blah,
blah.
Cause I would think that,

2268
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:56.700
what is it?
Originally money was supposed to be gold notes,
right?
It was like,

2269
02:13:56.701 --> 02:13:58.200
this a hundred dollars is worth $100,

2270
02:13:58.210 --> 02:14:00.930
and if you already have the hundred dollars in gold,
you don't need the money.

2271
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:05.320
They don't need the money.
What am I paying taxes fuck's going on here?

2272
02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:10.100
Like just chisel a quarter of it.
Hey,
you go,
here's a little piece for you.
Yeah.

2273
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:15.620
I think in the future gold,
uh,
like the idea of like,
like,

2274
02:14:15.730 --> 02:14:17.280
or a resource based economy.

2275
02:14:17.281 --> 02:14:20.700
Like whether it's gold or diamonds or how would it be worth that?

2276
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.110
That's a way better idea papers,

2277
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.480
credit cards and money and you know,
the,
the system that we have now,

2278
02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:29.880
like the idea of the system that we have now,

2279
02:14:29.881 --> 02:14:33.600
like a piece of paper represents 100 bucks and what the hundred bucks gets you

2280
02:14:33.601 --> 02:14:37.820
fluctuates depending on how the fucking economy is doing and points,

2281
02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:42.670
man buy bitcoins.
I have some bitcoins to you.
Yeah.
But I didn't buy him.
Um,

2282
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:46.860
so I'm giving them away.
I did a,
a,
a thing I had this guy on.

2283
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:51.480
I listened to your podcast.
Yeah.
She was very interesting actually.
Yeah.
Well,

2284
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:52.800
you know,
I think it's possible.

2285
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:56.370
It's very possible that that could be a currency in the future.
It was right.

2286
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.830
I listened to that podcast immediately before that Mt.

2287
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:02.490
Gox thing took fucking everyone money telling them.
I was like,
Oh shit.

2288
02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.110
That was hilarious.

2289
02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:06.930
That Mt Gox thing is just shows you how nutty the Internet is.

2290
02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:10.950
I laughed because everyone said I should buy bitcoins instead of cars.

2291
02:15:10.951 --> 02:15:14.400
And I said,
fuck you.
I can still drive my cars.
Where's your well you could still,

2292
02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:17.290
the bitcoins are still good if they weren't in Mt.
Gox and Mt.
Gox thing.

2293
02:15:17.291 --> 02:15:20.820
It was a crazy thing cause it was the magic,
the gathering exchange.

2294
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:24.960
That's what it was.
That quick off,
is that what that is?
It was magic.

2295
02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:28.560
The gathering exchange was with the originator of Mt.

2296
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.190
Gox and what they originally were supposed to be doing was exchanging like

2297
02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:35.340
things from the fucking game and then along the way they start.
Yes,

2298
02:15:35.341 --> 02:15:38.610
look up the story.
Fascinating Shit.
Along the way,

2299
02:15:38.611 --> 02:15:43.020
they started designing digital currency and when they started doing it,

2300
02:15:43.021 --> 02:15:45.660
they didn't have any of the security in place.
They didn't,

2301
02:15:45.661 --> 02:15:50.661
they weren't set up for it and they've lost something like $350 million worth of

2302
02:15:50.941 --> 02:15:54.510
bitcoin.
So they started by trading manna.
Is that what you're saying?

2303
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:58.290
I don't know how that stuff works,
but that's what it came.
Mt.

2304
02:15:58.290 --> 02:16:02.100
Gox is that's short for magic.
The gathering exchange.

2305
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.010
How nerdy is it that I know what the currency is in magic?
The gathering.

2306
02:16:06.011 --> 02:16:08.310
He did know and I didn't even know what you're talking about.
What is it?

2307
02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:11.840
[inaudible] is the currency in magic.
The gathering.
She erased that.

2308
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.820
I am that fucking horrible.
I mean,
you can get that shit out of your head.

2309
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:16.790
He'll read deck son.
All right.

2310
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.690
If you had to recommend a convertible sports car,
today's climate,

2311
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:24.510
what's the car?
Uh,

2312
02:16:25.050 --> 02:16:29.100
you got a hundred grand below how gender and 102.

2313
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:30.730
Oh,

2314
02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:32.200
<v 4>well 200 okay.
All right.</v>

2315
02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:36.780
Joe's like how much [inaudible] all right,

2316
02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:41.740
well for you now for anybody,
what I'm saying is in the old days,

2317
02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.480
okay,
when you looked at a guy driving a sports car,
yes.

2318
02:16:45.481 --> 02:16:48.300
You look at gentleman and he had a scarf on.
It's blowing in the breeze.

2319
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:52.750
Got fucking Jaguar pilots goggles on Wayfairs and a fucking cigar.

2320
02:16:52.751 --> 02:16:55.110
Yet there was always no roof.
You know,
it was like,
yeah.

2321
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:57.460
Roofless option was the sporty option.
Yeah.

2322
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.430
But somewhere along the line we found that to be folly.

2323
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:03.880
Well the chassis rigidity came into play,
you know,

2324
02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:07.700
cause you got your GD 500 was a convertible.
Yeah.
And you did not,

2325
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:13.180
I did not like the chassies but what I did like it was how stupid that car was.

2326
02:17:13.210 --> 02:17:15.890
It was America.
Fuck yeah.
In a car.
Yeah.

2327
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:20.070
But the horsepower being convertible,
it had kind of a shitty chassis.
It's,

2328
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:24.730
it's sloppy.
The coops are somewhere along the way.
People started saying,

2329
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:28.360
if you want to really get the performance out of it,
it has to be a coop.

2330
02:17:28.390 --> 02:17:31.330
Well it sometimes actually make cars that were meant to be convertible.

2331
02:17:31.331 --> 02:17:35.700
It's from the get go and then you know,
and they like the MP 12 in a way.

2332
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:37.870
And then the Nissan three seven e z as well.

2333
02:17:37.871 --> 02:17:39.760
It was designed to be a roadster from the MP,

2334
02:17:39.761 --> 02:17:44.350
12 C Z fucking how much does that bitch cost?
So used her back,
leak

2335
02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.910
it up.
Oh,
it's hot in here.
Yeah.

2336
02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:53.620
One 70 those things costs $170,000 and you'd used yeah.

2337
02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.590
And the top pops down and goes into the back in some way.
Or is that a spider?

2338
02:17:57.980 --> 02:18:02.980
The Spider Virginia has like two 52 60 $250,000 it's a goddamn house in New

2339
02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:08.290
Orleans.
Yeah.
Troy post in America.
It's not even a parking spot.

2340
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.010
No.
If you want a convertible for a hundred grand,
you want

2341
02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.080
a Jaguar f type that new Jaguar.
It was going to ask you about that.

2342
02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:20.310
Is that a cool car?
It looks pretty wild.
Yeah.
It's cool.

2343
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:24.010
Dynamically not quite as good as the nine 11 but so fucking cool.

2344
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:26.260
Not quite as good but not quite as pretty God damn.

2345
02:18:26.261 --> 02:18:29.800
But it's so cool as a cruiser,
like as a,
as a,

2346
02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:34.140
as a go fast and have fun,
but I don't care about a lap time.
Correct sir.

2347
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:35.470
It makes a great sound.

2348
02:18:35.471 --> 02:18:40.120
It's fucking loud and obnoxious and beautiful looking car too at the mall the

2349
02:18:40.121 --> 02:18:41.760
other day.
Just like,
Whoa,
but you,

2350
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:45.150
you shit on jags cause you shit on British cars.
So I tried to do it.

2351
02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:49.210
I had an XKR convertible like in 1999 it was like,
it was,

2352
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:52.450
it was a supercharged version,
you know the r version.
I was cool looking car.

2353
02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.720
It was a cool looking car.
Yeah it was a cool design.
It look,

2354
02:18:56.050 --> 02:18:58.780
I thought it looked actually better than the Aston Martin,

2355
02:18:58.781 --> 02:19:01.290
which was a db seven and and it,
you know,

2356
02:19:01.291 --> 02:19:03.940
it was foster but it was just really floppy.

2357
02:19:03.941 --> 02:19:08.520
I mean I was going to kill myself driving at a track or in canyons and that car

2358
02:19:08.550 --> 02:19:12.760
cause the suspension,
it was just all floppy driven.
Fucking every car there is.

2359
02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:16.180
And for you to say that his cars are the best cards you've ever driven,

2360
02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:16.991
they're really,

2361
02:19:16.991 --> 02:19:21.991
well when I drove a stock gt three rs at the time I was like this is the best

2362
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:26.410
car I've ever driven.
His cars are just better than that.
That's incredible.

2363
02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:31.190
It's that turn to 12 so what about for our four or five?

2364
02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:34.040
Eight they're very nice.
They are very nice.

2365
02:19:34.041 --> 02:19:39.041
But they're not like the Porsche gt three rs is everything that you want about

2366
02:19:39.561 --> 02:19:43.520
driving a race car,
but it doesn't beat you up for making that decision.

2367
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:45.530
And the the frog.
A lot of other cars,

2368
02:19:45.531 --> 02:19:47.990
like I just drove the Mercedes SLS black series,

2369
02:19:47.991 --> 02:19:52.991
which is the race track version of the goals of their easygoing SLS.

2370
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:54.080
Right.

2371
02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.460
And all the tradeoff you get for the race track performance makes it worse to

2372
02:19:58.461 --> 02:20:03.110
drive on the street.
The throttles touchy,
it's stiff.
It's,

2373
02:20:03.111 --> 02:20:06.440
you know,
it's wider and lower and less practical.

2374
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:10.700
But the gt three Rs and,
and Alex is,
cars are,

2375
02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:16.010
they don't kick you in the fucking Dick because you decided you wanted to drive

2376
02:20:16.011 --> 02:20:20.590
a race car.
Do you like luxury cars at all to you?
Like fuck yes,
this ls.

2377
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:24.530
They're all right.
Yeah,
the new range rovers,
I love them.
Really love them.

2378
02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:28.280
Now aren't range rovers kind of Shitty cars though?
They're not reliable,

2379
02:20:28.281 --> 02:20:31.130
but when they work,
they're amazing.
They're going to going off road.

2380
02:20:31.131 --> 02:20:34.940
They're good on farms.
There's really good though.
How come they're not reliable?

2381
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:37.810
Because they're built in England?
That's what it is,
right?
The people suck it.

2382
02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:42.710
We have the great ideas,
we have really great ideas,
but like our manufacturing,

2383
02:20:42.711 --> 02:20:45.410
it went down the toilet like many years ago and we didn't change.

2384
02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:48.050
Now is a good time for Range Rover.
All the,

2385
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:53.110
all the money that Ford put into them over the last 10 years is coming out in

2386
02:20:53.391 --> 02:20:55.460
Jaguar and Land Rovers,
new cars.

2387
02:20:55.461 --> 02:21:00.330
Now Ford owns Jaguar and Land Rover owned for a while and now Tom,
Tom,

2388
02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:03.350
who the fuck is taught Indian,
very rich Indian dude.

2389
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.290
And they make these little like,
uh,

2390
02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:10.160
I don't know what the little like almost smart cards,
little cheap cars in India,

2391
02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:12.530
but they also now own Jaguar and Land Rover.
Whoa.

2392
02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:16.550
Well it's better than like a Russian kid owning a car company.
That was that.

2393
02:21:16.890 --> 02:21:20.750
That wasn't bad.
Who was that?
That was a,
uh,
what did they,

2394
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:24.240
who did they use a company in England called Tvr.
I remember that.

2395
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:29.450
So remember that movie with John Travolta?
Yeah.
The same source.

2396
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:33.860
No,
not that one.
Why do you remember that one?

2397
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:38.660
That one really good at Portuguese.
You learn the Portuguese language.

2398
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:43.640
Not all of it.
No fucking new one with scarlet Johannson.

2399
02:21:43.641 --> 02:21:47.930
They inject it with some shit and she learns Chinese and five minutes fucking

2400
02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:51.800
movies.
She's ripping off John Travolta.
Goddamn it's Carly get better than that.

2401
02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.200
He had an avenger is real hair.
Then

2402
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:57.680
everyone went nuts for that car.

2403
02:21:57.681 --> 02:21:59.960
And that was a TVR cause they didn't have it here.

2404
02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:04.250
And there was a company that sort of on the edge of death pretty much his whole

2405
02:22:04.251 --> 02:22:04.611
life.

2406
02:22:04.611 --> 02:22:09.500
And so some Russian billionaire kid like bought it as sort of a toy TVR oh,

2407
02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:13.120
throw that in the garbage.
That isn't the one like these,
these,

2408
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:17.240
these things are raw and light and they're like,
they're like an English viper.

2409
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:19.160
Yeah,
but just not even built that well.

2410
02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:22.730
Do you remember that shitty movie with Charlie Sheen was a Porsche Steve.
Yeah.

2411
02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:26.130
No Man's land.
All the Porsche people

2412
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:29.980
<v 1>love that Charlie Sheen movie.
The chase.
Oh,</v>

2413
02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:35.010
that was really bad.
That was shitty.
That wasn't nick naulty or nick cage.

2414
02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:39.270
<v 3>So remember.
Yeah,
I remember.
No.
Yeah,
I did look at no man's land.
Right.</v>

2415
02:22:39.271 --> 02:22:42.630
Just watch a scene where there's actually a car chase in it and you see them,

2416
02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:46.800
you know,
speeding away in like an eighties you know,
nine 11 turbo or whatever,

2417
02:22:46.801 --> 02:22:50.460
nine,
nine 11 they're stealing and then following them is always,
you know,

2418
02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:55.050
this shitty eighties Camaro and it cannot go straight or put down any power of

2419
02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:57.420
any kind.
It's just literally doing this the whole way.

2420
02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:01.360
<v 1>Yeah,
they really,
they had Porsches deals.
Listen,</v>

2421
02:23:01.361 --> 02:23:06.361
you got to make that chase car real shitbox like those nine 30 turbos that was

2422
02:23:07.451 --> 02:23:10.540
in that movie.
Yeah.
What else could,
what could beat them back then?

2423
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:15.630
Ferraris land was it Flambeau is not nine five nine five nine c you would have

2424
02:23:15.701 --> 02:23:16.660
to have something like that.

2425
02:23:17.050 --> 02:23:22.050
But it was pre 959-ONE-8Y-68Y seven there was nothing around that could fuck up.

2426
02:23:24.881 --> 02:23:25.990
They were really fast.

2427
02:23:25.991 --> 02:23:30.280
Those were zero to 60 in five seconds and like the seven nine first gear.

2428
02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:31.990
Oh that's so cool.

2429
02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:33.330
<v 3>Yeah.
My,</v>

2430
02:23:33.370 --> 02:23:37.650
my 79 nine 30 like I could get on the freeway and I could still,
you know,

2431
02:23:37.651 --> 02:23:40.930
I would start,
you know,
from,
from a stop sign,
you know,

2432
02:23:41.010 --> 02:23:43.590
and go on the freeway and it did not change gear.
You know

2433
02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:44.840
<v 1>like I could just sit there.
No.</v>

2434
02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:49.880
Is it possible to do something like that but make it a car that you could like

2435
02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:54.470
that nine minster,
not nine Rsr or what w what the fuck do you call it?

2436
02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:58.190
Is it possible to make something like that that you could drive like a gt three,

2437
02:23:58.191 --> 02:24:02.660
like an older nine 11 no,
too much work.
Too much,

2438
02:24:03.790 --> 02:24:08.330
too much hockey.
Much Frankenstein.
You ever seen that video?
Well it's a race car,

2439
02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:12.530
right?
Basically race,
it would have zero compliance.
You'd be getting beaten up.

2440
02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:13.443
Could drive it.

2441
02:24:14.930 --> 02:24:18.470
I'm looking for something that's bolted right to the wheels themselves.

2442
02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:24.050
The suspension or show that you saw us make the video of the red one that's like

2443
02:24:24.741 --> 02:24:27.900
that.
Is it really just that car beat you up a little bit.
That car,

2444
02:24:27.901 --> 02:24:32.780
it was amazing.
That's a,
that's a B.
That's thing is insane.

2445
02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:37.820
275 horsepower at the wheels and it's how much does it weigh?
500 pounds,

2446
02:24:37.821 --> 02:24:42.440
2100 pounds or something.
It's stupid light.
No carpet,

2447
02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:43.333
no nothing.

2448
02:24:43.570 --> 02:24:46.190
But isn't it interesting like there's a bunch of people that are going to that

2449
02:24:46.191 --> 02:24:46.851
like the,
uh,

2450
02:24:46.851 --> 02:24:51.830
the actual design lead designer of Buggati has a Porsche that he has kevlar body

2451
02:24:51.831 --> 02:24:52.990
panels.
He's,
no,

2452
02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:58.160
I already knew the head of a company that makes the heaviest fucking car,

2453
02:24:58.491 --> 02:25:01.040
you know,
4,400 pounds of a Rod.

2454
02:25:01.310 --> 02:25:04.090
His d chooses to drive something that's like 2000 pounds.

2455
02:25:04.310 --> 02:25:08.090
The most minimalist version of that car too.
I mean,
he has the same thing.

2456
02:25:08.091 --> 02:25:12.230
It got it interior,
everything is removed.
No AC,

2457
02:25:12.231 --> 02:25:14.060
no radio,
no nothing.

2458
02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:17.990
He just has this super light car and it doesn't even look like a crazy engine.

2459
02:25:17.991 --> 02:25:21.450
Like,
no,
it's not even a crazy engine.
It's a fairly basic engine,
isn't it?
Yeah.

2460
02:25:21.451 --> 02:25:21.570
For

2461
02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:24.250
<v 3>those kinds of cars.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
people,</v>

2462
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:27.460
<v 4>you don't need much.
Light goes a long way.
W we're reasoning.</v>

2463
02:25:27.461 --> 02:25:30.850
I was getting at this as you were saying while you were driving that BBI car

2464
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:33.010
that after all this,

2465
02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.690
these years of doing tuned where you're driving all these fucking wild,
crazy,

2466
02:25:37.691 --> 02:25:42.691
supercharged fucking super horsepower that this is like what you were enjoying,

2467
02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:46.990
light is really good.
What's a good way,
like all this crazy power.

2468
02:25:46.991 --> 02:25:51.550
It's like you can't use that whenever you get into it for two seconds and then

2469
02:25:51.551 --> 02:25:56.500
you have no right to use it continuously.
You have to stop that 5,000 pound Brit,

2470
02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.080
you know,
repeatedly and then your brakes.
Shit.
You know,

2471
02:25:59.081 --> 02:26:01.880
and you're surprised why runways and stuff when it gets to the how,

2472
02:26:01.890 --> 02:26:06.810
the top end of this thousand one ways these people are racing on runways that

2473
02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:11.470
that for sure.
That's 600 horsepower.
Yeah.
The Evo guys,

2474
02:26:11.471 --> 02:26:13.150
you know with the parachute on the back.
I mean,
yeah,

2475
02:26:13.151 --> 02:26:16.840
they have to go to like fully sanctuary,
but when you're driving a car like that,

2476
02:26:16.841 --> 02:26:21.130
BBI Porsche,
you can use all of it.
Yeah.
And you're just,

2477
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:24.780
you light light is good.
You don't need a zillion horsepower.
You didn't enjoy it.

2478
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:28.420
Enjoy it as much as you do.
Enjoy driving the GT three Rs.

2479
02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:31.050
All the limits are fucking so high.
I would,

2480
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:34.390
I'd go to jail in 10 minutes if I had one of those things.

2481
02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:39.160
You had one of the Gdpr as is,
but if you had one of those BBI Porsche's,

2482
02:26:39.370 --> 02:26:40.610
you could actually drive it all the time.

2483
02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.490
Probably can drive it and stay in a jail.
But I'd be,

2484
02:26:42.491 --> 02:26:46.330
my body would shrivel up into like a fucking old man.
Here's the question though.

2485
02:26:46.390 --> 02:26:50.220
Oh yeah.
For you it'd be back check is fucking shot but here's the question.

2486
02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:53.540
Would you be able to enjoy it after driving and gt three Rs?

2487
02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.350
Like if you probably all these all we something that's like oldest sort of like

2488
02:26:58.360 --> 02:26:59.320
frozen in time.

2489
02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:04.321
It will always be that you can always go back to it and it doesn't wear off.

2490
02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:09.250
Whereas like this new shit where it's like computer controlled and paddle

2491
02:27:09.251 --> 02:27:13.040
shifters,
like every time there's the new one,
the old one feels old.

2492
02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:18.220
Whereas something that is stick shift and sort of analog is kind of timeless and

2493
02:27:18.221 --> 02:27:21.010
sort of frozen in that moment.
Like a 69 Mustang.

2494
02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:26.040
Always be a sixth will always be a 69 Mustang and it will never feel any older

2495
02:27:26.381 --> 02:27:30.520
than it already is.
But an 89 Mustang is kind of dog shit.
Fuck you.

2496
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:37.750
I'm taking my,
I'm taking mine and get some crazy shit to go soon.

2497
02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:42.040
Actually on NSX feels good.
It feels as good as any came.

2498
02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:46.480
The porches of it done one.
It was a 275 horsepower,

2499
02:27:46.481 --> 02:27:49.610
five speed.
It was one of my other six Pete.
He was one of my favorite cars ever.

2500
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:51.070
Yeah.
It wasn't that fast,

2501
02:27:51.071 --> 02:27:55.060
but it was fun to drive one to wring it out and use it and you could use,

2502
02:27:55.061 --> 02:27:58.150
the whole thing was so balanced.
The car was just sit like,

2503
02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:01.150
it really made you feel like you were,
you know,
you're really doing it.

2504
02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:04.630
You were really moving except the horns on the thumbs.
Neat.

2505
02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:08.920
Ferrari anchors are on the steering wheel.

2506
02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:12.520
The Horn is on the horn is in the same places.
It wasn't your car.

2507
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.930
The blinkers are on the steering wheel to dare they how dare ones.
Um,
what,

2508
02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.890
what excites you about what's coming out right now about the new cars that are

2509
02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:23.390
out that you've been driving cars you drive.
How many cars do you drive a year?

2510
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:29.000
150 to 200 usually.
That's insane.
That's a lot.
A lot of new cars.
That's insane.

2511
02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:32.940
What is exciting right now?
Holy Shit.
Well,
the new Mustang is exciting.
Yeah.

2512
02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:37.310
And then in suspension and Mustang,
finally a turbo engine.
Really?
Yeah.

2513
02:28:37.311 --> 02:28:40.880
There's a four cylinder turbo that's going to be kind of the tuner special for

2514
02:28:40.881 --> 02:28:43.190
the Mustang.
It's going to be neat.
Interesting too,

2515
02:28:43.210 --> 02:28:44.100
because it's going to be lightweight.

2516
02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:48.470
And what about the a alpha foresee if you're driven that I haven't driven it.

2517
02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:50.960
Chris.
Chris Harris drove it and liked it.
Um,

2518
02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:54.590
other people have driven it and said different things.
I'm,
I'm excited for it,

2519
02:28:54.591 --> 02:28:58.570
but I want to try it.
Try to put out the big horsepower Mustang because they're,

2520
02:28:58.571 --> 02:29:03.030
they're going to have a new problem.
The Shelby probably 2016 I would,
yeah.

2521
02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:06.130
It'll be at least a year after the first,
after the first call.

2522
02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:09.710
They can have a gt though.
Yeah.
There's three engines is the base.

2523
02:29:09.711 --> 02:29:13.610
One is a v six and the turbo four is a step up from the v six actually,

2524
02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:16.610
and then the VA will be like 450 horsepower.

2525
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.730
That's going to be interesting to see.
Will be the boss.
302 engine is the Va.

2526
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.330
I wonder if they'll do like a whole Laguna Saika version.

2527
02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:23.960
We'll do something like that.

2528
02:29:23.961 --> 02:29:27.680
The boss 302 was too successful for them not to do another something that's

2529
02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:30.240
really well and the new challenger Hellcat is,

2530
02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:32.380
which is the best name ever for a car.
Yeah.

2531
02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:35.090
I just looked at pictures of that man.
It's pretty Beastie looking.

2532
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:36.170
It looks pretty bad ass,

2533
02:29:36.171 --> 02:29:39.440
but it also looks like it doesn't have any fucking back tires

2534
02:29:41.310 --> 02:29:46.190
on rims.
Needy back,
tired vehicle.
The tires go.

2535
02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:50.300
I go get.
That was it.
Look,
I'm not comfortable.
Stomped on the gas.

2536
02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:54.990
I think it's fine.
I think it's fun meant for doing burnouts probably.

2537
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:57.740
Why the tire?
The more burned out.
Yeah.
Well that'll work.

2538
02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:03.100
600 fucking horsepower to be sick and the new m three and m four I'm excited.

2539
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:06.680
I just hope that this has some handling to it.
I think it would be cool if they,

2540
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:09.710
you know,
they had it where it can compete with like the new Camaro.

2541
02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:14.280
The big man that's a 40,000 pound plus car.
It's a big car.
Those,

2542
02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:18.290
those cars are like their gt cars.
They're great on a road trip.

2543
02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:22.310
They're great for weed.
That east [inaudible] suspension in it.

2544
02:30:22.311 --> 02:30:25.220
I mean how much bigger is a Camaro or how much bigger is this then a Camaro?

2545
02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:30.500
It's probably 600 pounds.
700 pounds heavier than,
wow.
It's a big,
it's a big girl.

2546
02:30:30.501 --> 02:30:33.650
That thing drove one when I did my Scifi show.
I enjoyed it,

2547
02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:37.910
but it did feel like a gt car.
Good cruiser.
Six feet worse.
It does.
Yeah.

2548
02:30:37.930 --> 02:30:40.710
Did that Piss the pistol grip factor?
I liked it is,
they're neat.

2549
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:44.400
They're just not race cars rather have like,
you know,

2550
02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:47.090
a thousand pounds less than a hundred horsepower more though,
you know,

2551
02:30:47.091 --> 02:30:49.460
like a 3000 pound.
Yeah.
It would be so much to put,

2552
02:30:49.461 --> 02:30:53.970
there ain't nothing wrong with a 660 pound dogs.
Challenging Shit.
Yeah.

2553
02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:57.110
I mean,
I just want one in my own garage.

2554
02:30:57.111 --> 02:31:01.030
I'm not going to go drop 60 on it right now,
but I'm glad it exists.
Yeah.

2555
02:31:01.370 --> 02:31:04.730
You know,
as a like a comfortable daily driver.
It's a comfortable,

2556
02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:09.080
really good seats.
Most powerful muscle car and Chrysler history.

2557
02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:13.790
Does it have any specs?
I think looked at me.
666 horsepower.

2558
02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:17.410
It's supercharge 6.4 Liter v eight that looks and the way it looks.

2559
02:31:17.411 --> 02:31:20.130
Scroll bar and scroll back up real quick.
See this?
There's that

2560
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:21.360
<v 3>headlight.
There's an,</v>

2561
02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:26.600
that's an air intake right next to the headline like dragged out or JD MD drill

2562
02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:29.880
away,
take out the headlight and put an intake there.
They've done that here.

2563
02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:33.670
You said you had a super,
a lot of people would take that front light out.
Yeah,

2564
02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:34.700
right.
And it would on the,

2565
02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:37.950
I think it was on the driver's side and so they'd go down the track at night

2566
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:39.210
with one light,
which was illegal,

2567
02:31:39.211 --> 02:31:42.060
but they'd have this whole going all the way in with a,

2568
02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:44.690
with a tube and intake into the engine.
That's so

2569
02:31:44.890 --> 02:31:47.320
<v 4>crazy.
No.
Does that mean it takes away one of the headlights,</v>

2570
02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:49.180
like less safe to drive.

2571
02:31:49.181 --> 02:31:52.370
The inner ones are auxiliary fog lights or whatever on that car.

2572
02:31:52.371 --> 02:31:55.210
You've just changed the headlight pattern to me.
Cool.
And it's actually,

2573
02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.670
that's got like a little what they call angel eyes.

2574
02:31:57.671 --> 02:32:02.260
Like BMWs have the rings that intakes got an angel I thing around it.

2575
02:32:02.490 --> 02:32:07.180
Is it a weird time for fucking performance cars where a car that used to be

2576
02:32:07.181 --> 02:32:10.510
ridiculous and he's out of the box.
Mustang gt.

2577
02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:15.550
It used to be to have 425 horsepower,
just drove a Lamborghini,

2578
02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:19.300
coon Tosh quattro valve.
Fastest car in the world at the time.

2579
02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:24.370
Mustang gt today makes as much horsepower as this for that you can buy for 28

2580
02:32:24.371 --> 02:32:25.204
grant.

2581
02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:30.140
Is there a corresponding increase in traffic accidents with all this horsepower?

2582
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:33.670
Increase safety features.
Tires are a big difference now.

2583
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:37.330
The speed limits haven't gone up.
Speed limits are exactly the fucking same.

2584
02:32:39.410 --> 02:32:43.590
<v 3>Do you ever,
have you ever seen yourself places fifth gear?
It was,
yeah,</v>

2585
02:32:43.591 --> 02:32:45.810
the original guys from top gear.
So they,

2586
02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:48.630
they went off and did a more serious car show.
So they,

2587
02:32:48.631 --> 02:32:53.390
I think it was about three years ago,
they did this a shoot or a c,

2588
02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:54.150
you know,

2589
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:58.700
segment on the traction control and they had Tiffany Dell try until base.

2590
02:32:59.100 --> 02:32:59.933
Oh

2591
02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:04.920
<v 4>it takes for the fucking manual.
Trump America.
Yeah.</v>

2592
02:33:05.130 --> 02:33:08.840
I'll tell you why.
Cause the pistol give kind of suck the fat Dick overrated.

2593
02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:10.560
It was overrated.
Wasn't that cool?

2594
02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:13.580
<v 3>Well they had this lawyer in,
in uh,</v>

2595
02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:16.740
in Europe basically in all of Europe where you know,
you,

2596
02:33:16.810 --> 02:33:20.450
you have to have traction control and old cars now and the system has to be so

2597
02:33:20.451 --> 02:33:24.000
good that even Tiffen to Dell could not get the car to slide you.

2598
02:33:24.210 --> 02:33:26.980
He tried every single thing he could to get it to slide.
Remember that?

2599
02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:30.050
But that one,
that was crazy.
Yeah.
Like the drift king,

2600
02:33:30.130 --> 02:33:34.210
<v 4>if anything,
what they've done to make the tires larger,</v>

2601
02:33:34.690 --> 02:33:38.620
it says the subtle trimmed Ham of the wheel wells accommodates the aggressive 20

2602
02:33:38.621 --> 02:33:43.330
inch aluminum wheel and tire package.
Peterman catalog,

2603
02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:48.640
probably they've gone inward with it.
The tie,
the wheels are,
are deeper,

2604
02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:51.910
deeper wheel.
So they don't stick out any further.

2605
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:54.770
<v 3>You know what else is silly though with these newer cars?</v>

2606
02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:57.970
So I don't even know how big are those wheels are probably 21.

2607
02:33:58.050 --> 02:33:58.260
<v 4>You know,</v>

2608
02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:00.740
why don't you watch your mouth when you're in my country calling our car cars

2609
02:34:00.741 --> 02:34:03.260
silly.
No,
no.
All of these

2610
02:34:03.370 --> 02:34:07.390
<v 3>cars I'm talking even at nine years or five,
nine,
nine one turbo,
right?</v>

2611
02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:10.820
It's got 20 inch wheels.
20.
Why not just have,
you know,

2612
02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.710
<v 4>because people want their shit on rims.
It's 20 inch too big.</v>

2613
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:19.690
Is that what you're saying?
Why do you race cars?
Race cars still use 18,

2614
02:34:19.810 --> 02:34:24.340
right?
That's the optimum.
Do they use 20 just for looks pretty much.

2615
02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:28.600
And to fit bigger breaks,
but you got to admit it does look fresh.
I agree.

2616
02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:31.250
Can I plug something before we get out of here?
Let's get out.
Last line.

2617
02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:36.190
Last time I was on the show,
we talked about going off this off road adventure.

2618
02:34:36.191 --> 02:34:40.480
We were doing 600 miles off road,
the state of Washington in some shit boxes.

2619
02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:43.600
The film comes out June 1st.
Beautiful.
What's it called?

2620
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:48.400
It's called all cars go to heaven.
It's available on Vimeo.
Uh,
it's uh,

2621
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:51.820
as a rental or a digital download,
pitiful.
It's also available.

2622
02:34:51.821 --> 02:34:56.110
It'll be available on our youtube channel and a,
we ran again pretty,

2623
02:34:56.310 --> 02:34:57.250
we shenanigans,

2624
02:34:57.450 --> 02:35:00.550
we shenanigans the shit out of a couple of beater cars across the state of

2625
02:35:00.551 --> 02:35:02.680
Washington.
It was fantastic.
I can't wait to see it.

2626
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:04.870
Somebody produced this for you.
Did you guys do,

2627
02:35:04.871 --> 02:35:08.920
what we did is we did it all in house production and all our whole crew appears

2628
02:35:08.921 --> 02:35:11.110
on camera too.
Not just me for that's glorious.

2629
02:35:11.170 --> 02:35:13.840
All cars go to heaven and there it is there.
The trailer,

2630
02:35:13.841 --> 02:35:15.310
the trailer gimme some volume.

2631
02:35:16.590 --> 02:35:20.550
<v 8>The entire state of Washington.
I am driving.
Oh,
you got headframe Cherokee.</v>

2632
02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:25.140
Zach is driving that and it's day two so far.

2633
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:30.330
What is up and he's down half a suspension.
Want to see how the rest of it goes?

2634
02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:32.670
Watch the whole movie.
Only at the smoking tire.

2635
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:40.840
<v 4>Yeah.
So we basically bought a cheap cars,</v>

2636
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:44.950
tried to go 600 miles off road,
uh,

2637
02:35:44.951 --> 02:35:47.470
across the entire state of Washington into the Canada.

2638
02:35:48.370 --> 02:35:52.690
And it's harder than it looks.
And he drove over ground.
No,
no.
Off Roading.

2639
02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:56.020
Look at this.
That's an 87 her we bought for 300 bucks.

2640
02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:58.760
But someone surfing on the hood.
Oh,
that was that.
He has that.

2641
02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.130
That's not recommended.
No,
not at all.
Wow.
Uh,

2642
02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:08.200
and so,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's a good good time.
That sounds awesome.
Four bucks.

2643
02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:10.630
I think it comes out of your box.
