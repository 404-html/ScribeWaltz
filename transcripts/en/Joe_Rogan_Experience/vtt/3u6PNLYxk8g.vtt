<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

85
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Or that mushroom that like falls on the ants and the ants going wander into the</v>

86
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>pool and drowned themselves.</v>

87
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

88
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this one.</v>

89
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You haven't seen that are acidic fun fungus.</v>

90
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're talking about the same thing I was talking about an aquatic worm</v>

91
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.701
<v Speaker 1>that grows into caterpillars bought or grasshoppers body gets to a certain size</v>

92
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>and then convinces the grasshopper to go sweat grass.</v>

93
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Arbors kids.</v>

94
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.220

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.541
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

96
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:51.951
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

97
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Fungus is different,</v>

98
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>but I love like what does that grass hopper.</v>

99
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

100
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not thinking anymore.</v>

101
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the,</v>

102
00:02:58.101 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the aquatic rewires his</v>

103
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 3>brain somehow or another,</v>

104
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

105
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 3>it's the weirdest,</v>

106
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 3>like how did that work with evolution?</v>

107
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Like has a bunch of other ones out there too.</v>

108
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I know there's one that makes some,</v>

109
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 3>some bugs head glow.</v>

110
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the bug it is,</v>

111
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 3>but it completely zombifies the bug takes over.</v>

112
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Just lift your leg up so that way the light's not facing.</v>

113
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that might be what that sound kind of distortion is.</v>

115
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

116
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

117
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

118
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean like does that sound better?</v>

119
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 3>People at home say yes.</v>

120
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 3>People at home on the treadmill.</v>

121
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

122
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Talked to a lot of fucking people in Australia that listened to the podcast.</v>

123
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of a trip,</v>

124
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>

126
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 3>last year when I was there,</v>

127
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have the podcast.</v>

128
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.903
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it.</v>

129
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.131
<v Speaker 3>Or if I did do it,</v>

130
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>it was only like we'd done like a couple of them and nobody knew about it.</v>

131
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.581
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>

132
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

133
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

134
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

135
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 3>when we were in Rudy Hill,</v>

136
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned the podcast and all these people cheered.</v>

137
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.061
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

138
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

139
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.780
<v Speaker 3>like how many of you fucking Pete?</v>

140
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought to start thinking about it like,</v>

141
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 3>has there ever been a medium like that where you can just put something online</v>

142
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 3>and someone on the other side of the continent can be a weekly listener of this</v>

143
00:03:59.711 --> 00:03:59.891
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

144
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

145
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

146
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean amazing cause there a lot of people.</v>

147
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

148
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 3>it's packed.</v>

150
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.060

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>The staff in Libya and the Middle East and Charlie Sheen,</v>

224
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

225
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.043
<v Speaker 3>I blame it,</v>

226
00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.573
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Sheen.</v>

227
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I rarely misses Rogan was ecstatic about the newest Charlie Sheen interview</v>

228
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>cause apparently he kept,</v>

229
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>comes off crazy on a fucking loon.</v>

230
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard any of it.</v>

231
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>He did a new one and he goes up,</v>

232
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>the only drug I'm on,</v>

233
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:12.434
<v Speaker 1>it's charming.</v>

234
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I need to hear that.</v>

235
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>We'll need to those actual words.</v>

236
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause on the way over to the airport,</v>

237
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>me and Ari were listening to,</v>

238
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

239
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.271
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

240
00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>the one who when it was on the Alex Jones show,</v>

242
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.321
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

243
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it got him kicked off that show.</v>

244
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>They canceled production of a show for the rest of the season because that one</v>

245
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>interview I heard,</v>

246
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.401
<v Speaker 1>I just recently,</v>

247
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>he said he's,</v>

248
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he's not quitting or he's back on it or something like that because I knew that</v>

249
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>there was a while they were going to have Emilia Esta Vez feel fill in.</v>

250
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.571
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought,</v>

251
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I just sit on that,</v>

252
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>that heard on or read on TMZ that and now he's like,</v>

253
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:42.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

254
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not leaving the shower.</v>

255
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Quitting wasn't his choice.</v>

256
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:46.274
<v Speaker 1>It was them.</v>

257
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

258
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what you're,</v>

259
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>where you're getting this from.</v>

260
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>They fired it.</v>

261
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.881
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you,</v>

262
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>why don't you look that up?</v>

263
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Because what they were saying was that they were canceling production of the</v>

264
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>show for the season because of his erratic behavior and that he needs to seek</v>

265
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:58.904
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

266
00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

267
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just tired of pretending that I'm not freaking winning at every corner at</v>

268
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:03.801
<v Speaker 1>every turn,</v>

269
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>just delivering the freaking goods over and over again.</v>

270
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And they asked him about piss tests and he goes,</v>

271
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

272
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll pass the first one.</v>

273
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Second one is in your mouth.</v>

274
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.763
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

275
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's called winning.</v>

276
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of pretending I'm here,</v>

277
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with the goddesses.</v>

278
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to pretend that I'm not living the perfect fricken life and I'm out</v>

279
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>there delivering the goods at every turn.</v>

280
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.691
<v Speaker 1>He's another.</v>

281
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

282
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I love him too man.</v>

283
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And I love him cause you got some coconut water.</v>

284
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You got two archetypes going on,</v>

285
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.123
<v Speaker 1>Charlie sheet.</v>

286
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>One of them is he just doing what really powerful guys had been doing for</v>

287
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

288
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>When they have a lot of money,</v>

289
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>they try to establish a Harem.</v>

290
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.043
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>

291
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that's like a basic thing that's been in society for a very long time.</v>

292
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>That's all he's doing.</v>

311
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.640
<v Speaker 1>he was upset that the guy said something at the one of the closings of the show.</v>

312
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:23.121

<v Speaker 1>It's on its way.</v>

364
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.323
<v Speaker 1>It's on its way.</v>

365
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of pretending that I'm not living the perfect freaking life.</v>

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.833

<v Speaker 1>Tired of pretending I'm not delivering their freaking goods.</v>

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.791
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious.</v>

394
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

395
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I need to put it all together with some material.</v>

396
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Ai Nine one one yes.</v>

397
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

398
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 1>a truther.</v>

399
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>He's gone as far as,</v>

400
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.411
<v Speaker 1>hold on one second.</v>

401
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>There were a real quick while we get over this because this is interesting.</v>

402
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.131
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

403
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

404
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.210
<v Speaker 1>He's gone as far as to write a fake question and answer with Obama where he,</v>

405
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>it looked like an interview with Obama when I first read it.</v>

406
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:50.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

407
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

408
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it gets to the end and then he tells you that it's fiction and wouldn't</v>

409
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>it be amazing if he actually had the opportunity to sit down with President</v>

410
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Obama had talked to them about this.</v>

411
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking Charlie Sheen might be a government agent.</v>

412
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing might just be his way of being a patriot and really</v>

413
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>discrediting the nine one.</v>

414
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>One truth or movement of what he's doing is he's just banging all these whores</v>

415
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:14.844
<v Speaker 1>for America.</v>

416
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.773
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

417
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And all the coke and all the horrors and all the erratic behavior is really just</v>

418
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>to make the nine one one truther movement look ridiculous.</v>

419
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think,</v>

420
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:24.924
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

421
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.241
<v Speaker 1>I think that's high,</v>

422
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>like 99% problem.</v>

423
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Mostly likely.</v>

424
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

425
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

426
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to pretend that I'm not leaving the perfect fricken life just</v>

427
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

428
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.840
<v Speaker 1>delivering the goods at every turn.</v>

429
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>He's trim drunk,</v>

430
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>he's faking the whole thing.</v>

431
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

432
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:41.904
<v Speaker 1>He's an agent.</v>

433
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 1>He's working for America.</v>

434
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:43.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

435
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>this nine 11 truther movement can really fuck up the foundation of this country.</v>

436
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Erode confidence in the base.</v>

437
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And so when Charlie Sheen goes out there on a deep end in Bahamas with a</v>

438
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>suitcase</v>

439
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 3>full of heroin with different color socks on,</v>

440
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

441
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean Charlie Sheen is out there doing it.</v>

442
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.331
<v Speaker 4>30 years ago,</v>

443
00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:01.380
<v Speaker 4>the CIA was like,</v>

444
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Speaker 4>get me a baby.</v>

445
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.243
<v Speaker 4>As developers,</v>

446
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.490
<v Speaker 3>we're going to just your rain.</v>

447
00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

448
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.060
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get them huge.</v>

449
00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:06.681
<v Speaker 3>Just we're going to do it with,</v>

450
00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:07.460
<v Speaker 3>to start him off.</v>

451
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Super legit.</v>

452
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

453
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Oliver Stone Movies platoon.</v>

454
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

455
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.021
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street.</v>

456
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:14.150
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be a fucking huge successful,</v>

457
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:14.780
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>

458
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.170
<v Speaker 3>active.</v>

459
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Then massive.</v>

460
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Just whores and drugs and,</v>

461
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.320
<v Speaker 3>and then a rebirth on television.</v>

462
00:12:21.321 --> 00:12:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And once we get them on television,</v>

463
00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:24.020
<v Speaker 3>then we've hit the final phase.</v>

464
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

465
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Because when he's on television,</v>

466
00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:29.390
<v Speaker 3>then he's in the people's homes and he's little bit humbled because he's not a</v>

467
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:30.350
<v Speaker 3>movie star anymore.</v>

468
00:12:30.351 --> 00:12:30.651
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

469
00:12:30.651 --> 00:12:30.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

470
00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:32.150
<v Speaker 3>now he's a television star.</v>

471
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite the same.</v>

472
00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:33.974
<v Speaker 3>So he's not as,</v>

473
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.550
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

474
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

475
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 3>he's already lost a little bit of credibility.</v>

476
00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's already sliding,</v>

477
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

478
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:41.750
<v Speaker 3>but then you hear he's making millions of dollars a week and he's about blowing</v>

479
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:44.630
<v Speaker 3>and doing crazy things while well now can Charlie Sheen's out of control?</v>

480
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.561
<v Speaker 3>So then you've got to say,</v>

481
00:12:45.561 --> 00:12:45.711
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

482
00:12:45.711 --> 00:12:46.310
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

483
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.860
<v Speaker 3>why is Charlie Sheen into the nine 11 truth movement?</v>

484
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Why is he doing that?</v>

485
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Because Charlie Sheen works for the government.</v>

486
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect plot.</v>

487
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.840
<v Speaker 3>You really think they would pay him $2 million a week for that Shitbag fucking</v>

488
00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 3>show that chose God drunk.</v>

489
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Terrible at show is a goddamn atrocity.</v>

490
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Of course they don't pay him $2 million a week.</v>

491
00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Speaker 3>This is just the mainstream news reports with the CIA tells him to report.</v>

492
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

493
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.271
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

494
00:13:08.271 --> 00:13:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm in there working for America at every fricking turn.</v>

495
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.951
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you,</v>

496
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:13.161
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

497
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>if you watch that show,</v>

498
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I can believe it cause that has to be one of the most miserable shows that there</v>

499
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.440
<v Speaker 3>is again about working at it.</v>

500
00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Like I said this about grace under fire.</v>

501
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:23.120
<v Speaker 3>When remember when Brett Butler had that TV show grace under fire.</v>

502
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.133
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

503
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.700
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you doing?</v>

504
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

505
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.050
<v Speaker 3>you got your whole shit on auto play.</v>

506
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.671
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

507
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:30.830
<v Speaker 3>when Brett Butler was on that,</v>

508
00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:31.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

509
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.410
<v Speaker 3>show grace under fire and she started going nutty,</v>

510
00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>like we're throwing fucking glasses of water and people's faces right screen.</v>

511
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I heard a lot of shit like that was when I was on hardball,</v>

512
00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:42.711
<v Speaker 3>the first sip Tom.</v>

513
00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Then I was on,</v>

514
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 3>it was like even before news radio when she was going Nutty,</v>

515
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.010
<v Speaker 3>just like screaming at people like she,</v>

516
00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:49.461
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

517
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

518
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:50.543
<v Speaker 3>it was infamous.</v>

519
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.620
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing where they,</v>

520
00:13:51.621 --> 00:13:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I believe they cancel the show.</v>

521
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.300
<v Speaker 3>This was the infamous statement that she said in front of like a table read.</v>

522
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.460
<v Speaker 3>If you fuck your wife,</v>

523
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.380
<v Speaker 3>the way you write comedy,</v>

524
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 3>no wonder why you're divorced.</v>

525
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.940
<v Speaker 3>She apparently said that like at a table read in front of network executives and</v>

526
00:14:07.941 --> 00:14:10.460
<v Speaker 3>all these people and threw something at him.</v>

527
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.080
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the great,</v>

528
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 3>the Great Ah,</v>

529
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.020
<v Speaker 3>getting shows canceled.</v>

530
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Screaming a romance.</v>

531
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I've heard two good ones.</v>

532
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Chris Titus is a good one.</v>

533
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.301
<v Speaker 3>And then this one.</v>

534
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:21.440
<v Speaker 3>But Chris Titus is a nice guy,</v>

535
00:14:21.441 --> 00:14:22.550
<v Speaker 3>so I won't say his over there.</v>

536
00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:23.820
<v Speaker 3>You've got to have to ask him about that</v>

537
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.421
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

538
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.440
<v Speaker 4>You got to look at like,</v>

539
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.303
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

540
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Speaker 4>if you look at how being an American celebrity carries with it,</v>

541
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 4>this bizarre psychological danger,</v>

542
00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:40.290
<v Speaker 4>because a pretty large percentage of our celebrities go fucking insane.</v>

543
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:40.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

544
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:42.020
<v Speaker 3>when you Morgan on something bad,</v>

545
00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:43.220
<v Speaker 3>you're f you're miserable.</v>

546
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.491
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

547
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:44.510
<v Speaker 3>and when you're a good comic,</v>

548
00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 3>like Brett Butler is crazy is that bitch was,</v>

549
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.360
<v Speaker 3>it was a good comic.</v>

550
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.220
<v Speaker 3>She was a real stand up comic.</v>

551
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 3>And if you're doing some show that,</v>

552
00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

553
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.973
<v Speaker 3>just not good,</v>

554
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

555
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 3>like she was a bill Hicks.</v>

556
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:54.711
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

557
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:54.921
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

558
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.680
<v Speaker 3>she was in the bill Hicks documentary about him talking about how great he was.</v>

559
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.131
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

560
00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like she,</v>

561
00:14:59.181 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

562
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

563
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>she was stuck.</v>

564
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.340
<v Speaker 3>She was stuck making a fuck load of money on something that's absolutely</v>

565
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 3>terrible and that's some soul stealing shit.</v>

566
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

567
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Like Tim Allen,</v>

568
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.621
<v Speaker 3>Tim Allen.</v>

569
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:10.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

570
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Was a legit standup comic at one point in time and literally quit at all for</v>

571
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 3>that show.</v>

572
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.581
<v Speaker 3>Did his show,</v>

573
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:17.940
<v Speaker 3>did his tool time show right?</v>

574
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it was called.</v>

575
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:19.791

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 3>I was going to turn this off.</v>

579
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.003
<v Speaker 3>Why are you gonna do that?</v>

00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.340
<v Speaker 3>It's called refrigerator.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't go crazy.</v>

586

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

587
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Problem is we did that before and then we never plug it back in.</v>

588
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Then it all my food goes bad and my pot soda gets warm.</v>

589
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what I put in front of the sun.</v>

590
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're feeling really fucking frisky where I didn't know that.</v>

591
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was ginger grass.</v>

592
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.470
<v Speaker 3>I was ignoring that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The show he's on sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

604
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And I said this about Brett Butler back in [inaudible] 94</v>

610
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.930

00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 1>He loves math or something.</v>

695
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be math.</v>

696
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just what I think meth.</v>

697
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.401

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

703
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:29.391
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

704
00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 1>if he paused,</v>

705
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>if he tested negative for radar online,</v>

706
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need more than three days clean,</v>

707
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I think three days,</v>

708
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:36.651
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

709
00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll test negative.</v>

710
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you'd take cleansers and drink water.</v>

711
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't mean shit.</v>

712
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

713
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>When did he test Monday?</v>

714
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're Charlie Sheen,</v>

715
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:44.851
<v Speaker 1>you just go,</v>

716
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

717
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna give you $4 million,</v>

718
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 1>make this test right.</v>

719
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:48.031
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

720
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

721
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.373
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

722
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>that's dumb.</v>

723
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 1>He could be manic depressive,</v>

724
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.500
<v Speaker 1>like he can be mad like that.</v>

725
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like someone and having someone having either a drug induced manic</v>

726
00:18:58.081 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 1>episode or just a manic episode because their brain's fucked up from all the</v>

727
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:02.761
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

728
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:04.010
<v Speaker 1>And it starts there starting a middle of,</v>

729
00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 1>what's amazing about it is there's two things.</v>

730
00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:06.181
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

731
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I wish he was a guy who was doing this that wasn't obviously insane.</v>

732
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

733
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 1>it would be so cool if he was just really having fun,</v>

734
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.161
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

735
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

736
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way he's doing it that he doesn't realize how that's going to come</v>

737
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:19.150
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

738
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

739
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to pretend that I'm not special.</v>

740
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm got to pretend and I'm not delivering the fricking goods or rock star from</v>

741
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

742
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:26.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:26.821
<v Speaker 1>like Whoa,</v>

744
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

745
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're a,</v>

746
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>because you're good at pretending like,</v>

747
00:19:30.351 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

748
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you should be weirded out by the fact that you have any success.</v>

749
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that's a performer that's not weirded out by the fact that how the fuck</v>

750
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 1>did I get to do this for a living?</v>

751
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:41.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

752
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you think you're special,</v>

753
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that no one who does stand up or acting or music is truly special.</v>

754
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.550
<v Speaker 1>They're just people that may accomplish special things and the reason why</v>

755
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it because they're on a path and they,</v>

756
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 1>they get on it and then they get better and then they tune into it and they</v>

757
00:19:58.771 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 1>figured out.</v>

758
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And that might be special,</v>

759
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>like achieving that level of proficiency with,</v>

760
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.820
<v Speaker 1>with music or with comedy or with acting,</v>

761
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:07.150
<v Speaker 1>with anything that is kind of special,</v>

762
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but the person that's doing it,</v>

763
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it's just because he kept going,</v>

764
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:11.731
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

766
00:20:11.731 --> 00:20:12.121
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

767
00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not special.</v>

768
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 1>The most talented person ever is not really a special person that the acts that</v>

769
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>they may achieve by whatever,</v>

770
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.801
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

771
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 1>whether it's because they're missing some sort of a social thing,</v>

772
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.530
<v Speaker 1>like some people don't get nervous around other people and they can begin to</v>

774
00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 1>open themselves up because of whatever weirdness that happened to them in their</v>

775
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.144
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

776
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Or some people just have this unbelievably exorbitant need for attention that</v>

777
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:38.750
<v Speaker 1>expresses itself in this really powerful dramatic performance style.</v>

778
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You know that they can just really do something that really rocks you and moves</v>

779
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you because they need you to love them that much.</v>

780
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>

781
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>even the most amazing,</v>

782
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 1>whenever it's just a fucking person and anybody like Charlie didn't really</v>

783
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 1>starts thinking they are special.</v>

784
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:52.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

785
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of them is just bullshit and,</v>

786
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>or how much of it is just him being on fucking Xanax or whatever the hell he is</v>

787
00:20:57.731 --> 00:20:58.320
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

788
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

789
00:20:59.130 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

790
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 1>when when you start thinking that you actually are special,</v>

791
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>do you think he's just fucking around also?</v>

792
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

793
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:04.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

794
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I think about it like it doesn't look like you though.</v>

795
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.180
<v Speaker 1>People don't care about the fucking media and what the,</v>

796
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>the news tab things and he's probably just sitting in there getting high</v>

797
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 1>laughing about this whole thing.</v>

798
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably don't you think?</v>

799
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's taking any of this shit seriously.</v>

800
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean the drugs Charlie's scene,</v>

801
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 1>do you really think he's thinking that?</v>

802
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I think he's sick.</v>

803
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>You kidding me?</v>

804
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't think there's something wrong with him?</v>

805
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just using interviews.</v>

806
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

807
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:26.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

808
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.640
<v Speaker 1>it seems a little,</v>

809
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

810
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 1>these interviews are erratic,</v>

811
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

812
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.191
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

813
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:30.441
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

814
00:21:30.441 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 1>these are not interviews by a man who is calculated and gone out there and</v>

815
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:34.691
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

816
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act like a wound for a goof.</v>

818
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

819
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you got going on here.</v>

820
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey Charlie Sheen's not that good an actor.</v>

821
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

822
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no way this is,</v>

823
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:43.331
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

824
00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:43.781
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

825
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:44.591
<v Speaker 1>you got an issue.</v>

826
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a,</v>

827
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue with him like back that up a little bit and let's listen to</v>

828
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:48.590
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

829
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.423
<v Speaker 5>one more time.</v>

830
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Tighter.</v>

831
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 5>Pretending like I'm not pitching a total freaking rock star from Mars and people</v>

832
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:56.751
<v Speaker 5>can't figure me out.</v>

833
00:21:56.751 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 5>They can't process.</v>

834
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't expect them to,</v>

835
00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:00.080
<v Speaker 5>you can't process me with a normal brain.</v>

836
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.760
<v Speaker 5>The trouble back there.</v>

837
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 5>Can we go and he wants a raise from 2 million to 3 million an episode.</v>

838
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 5>You want to do you want to race?</v>

839
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.371
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

840
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:09.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

841
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Look what they put me through when it comes to any apologies from she'd,</v>

842
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.860
<v Speaker 5>he says CBS execs shouldn't hold their breath.</v>

843
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 5>Do you OCBs and apology?</v>

844
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

845
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 5>they owe me a big one publicly while looking at my feet.</v>

846
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.220
<v Speaker 5>But it is interview with Good Morning America.</v>

847
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Charlie said he's clean.</v>

848
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.613
<v Speaker 5>Sort of.</v>

849
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

850
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

851
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.470
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

852
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.241
<v Speaker 5>I am on a drug.</v>

853
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 5>It's called him Charlie Sheen.</v>

854
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.273
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

855
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.303
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

856
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 5>it's not available because if you try it once,</v>

857
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:33.971
<v Speaker 5>you will die.</v>

858
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 5>Your face will melt off.</v>

859
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 5>And you're told him when we boom,</v>

860
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 5>you're exploded body.</v>

861
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:37.864
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

862
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.090
<v Speaker 1>He's not fucking around.</v>

863
00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just having fun.</v>

864
00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:46.561
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

865
00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've seen,</v>

866
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I like hookers in porn.</v>

867
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to make a mockery of this whole entire fucking bullshit.</v>

868
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a little bit of that for sure.</v>

869
00:22:53.551 --> 00:22:55.770
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the words he's saying that's,</v>

870
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:57.210
<v Speaker 1>those are the words of an insane man.</v>

871
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.240
<v Speaker 1>But somebody needs to animate a guy smoking some Charlie.</v>

872
00:23:02.461 --> 00:23:07.461
<v Speaker 1>She is body blowing up and it's coming up in the leaping over the core.</v>

873
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

874
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.030
<v Speaker 1>We love when someone's off the deep end like this,</v>

875
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.740
<v Speaker 1>that love it a society.</v>

876
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:14.221
<v Speaker 1>We love it.</v>

877
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You know him?</v>

878
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

879
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:15.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

880
00:23:15.631 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 1>this is way better than Lohan.</v>

881
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.271
<v Speaker 1>This is low hand.</v>

882
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>If she had a brain and she could talk Lohan around,</v>

883
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.820
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

884
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.311
<v Speaker 1>She didn't.</v>

885
00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:23.941
<v Speaker 1>Good effort.</v>

886
00:23:23.941 --> 00:23:24.131
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

887
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.670
<v Speaker 1>This is a thousand times better as an archetype,</v>

888
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and this archetype shows up in religion.</v>

889
00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It shows up in culture.</v>

890
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Not to take it too deep,</v>

891
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:35.931
<v Speaker 1>but it's the idea of a god coming to earth and his followers eating him die and</v>

892
00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:39.000
<v Speaker 1>nicest Jesus.</v>

893
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It happens again and again.</v>

894
00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:42.210
<v Speaker 1>This is a reoccurring thing and that's what we do.</v>

895
00:23:42.211 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 1>We get people really famous.</v>

896
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 1>We turn into like,</v>

897
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>we worship</v>

898
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

899
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 4>we call them idols,</v>

900
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 4>and then we fucking kill him.</v>

901
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.900
<v Speaker 4>I got news for him,</v>

902
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

903
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Nobody worships Charlie Sheen.</v>

904
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Hilaire you know there are a few,</v>

905
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 4>there's a few like no,</v>

906
00:23:56.721 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 4>you get that fuse.</v>

907
00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Two and a half men start fellow fans out there.</v>

908
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 4>He's flooded every day with messages from weird,</v>

909
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 4>mediocre people.</v>

910
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.751
<v Speaker 4>Pretend he's not special.</v>

911
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

912
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets to your rockstar.</v>

913
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're generating that much fucking money.</v>

914
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:13.694
<v Speaker 4>It's got to get to here.</v>

915
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 4>He probably was sick of that showed he's sabotaging himself to get off that</v>

916
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking show.</v>

917
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that dude.</v>

918
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is going to carry.</v>

919
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 4>This is going to carry on much more than that.</v>

920
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:25.950
<v Speaker 4>There's obviously some sort of a,</v>

921
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 4>a bad relationship between him and the guy who the executive producer of the</v>

922
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:29.541
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

923
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 4>But that's normal.</v>

924
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

925
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.893
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember it.</v>

926
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 4>That's really normal though.</v>

927
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 4>That shit happens all the time.</v>

928
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:36.381
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it happen.</v>

929
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 4>There's always a battle of egos between the talent.</v>

930
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.831
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>

00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.351
<v Speaker 4>It just happened.</v>

965
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 4>It's just my friend.</v>

966
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 4>It was my friend who,</v>

967
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>this musician in a band called ohm,</v>

968
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.370
<v Speaker 4>which is an awesome fucking man and the holy science,</v>

969
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 4>but basically just tells the story about getting in the back of his friend's car</v>

970
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 4>while he's on acid.</v>

971
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.470
<v Speaker 4>He kinda knew this guy didn't know him that well and his friend's car,</v>

972
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.460
<v Speaker 4>the sides of it had been greased like,</v>

973
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.363
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

974
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 4>You told him you were struggling in the bag.</v>

975
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

976
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

977
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 4>And so he's just starting to trip.</v>

978
00:25:57.171 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 4>And in his mind he's like,</v>

979
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.061
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

980
00:25:59.061 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably,</v>

981
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably being paranoid.</v>

982
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 4>This guy didn't like intentionally greased this fucking car and the guy pulls</v>

983
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:06.854
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

990
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 4>He stuck in the car.</v>

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.951
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what you doing.</v>

1048
00:28:11.951 --> 00:28:12.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1049
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:12.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1050
00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:12.281
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1051
00:28:12.281 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I wonder who's doing what and drug wise,</v>

1052
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and all these girls are saying cocaine.</v>

1054
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

1055
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's coke.</v>

1056
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's 100% obviously an amphetamine.</v>

1057
00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe Adderall.</v>

1058
00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's taking Adderall on top of it.</v>

1059
00:28:23.231 --> 00:28:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just straight arm speed.</v>

1060
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people on Adderall,</v>

1061
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 1>but people were on it fits into design it every day.</v>

1062
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1063
00:28:30.311 --> 00:28:30.850
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1064
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.683
<v Speaker 1>Takes it every day.</v>

1065
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.910
<v Speaker 4>I learned how to Code in action script on Adderall.</v>

1067
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Is that good though?</v>

1068
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Actionscript sucks.</v>

1069
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:42.501
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1070
00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Adderall is a great trick.</v>

1071
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like scientists like studied cocaine and they were like,</v>

1072
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.660
<v Speaker 4>they came up with a wonderful version of it.</v>

1073
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.500
<v Speaker 4>I took half of one recently.</v>

1074
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.400
<v Speaker 4>My first time I ever did it,</v>

1075
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.241
<v Speaker 4>he took half of one.</v>

1076
00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:54.074
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

1077
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.070
<v Speaker 4>Took the second half.</v>

1078
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I was like too much cocaine.</v>

1079
00:28:57.951 --> 00:28:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1080
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1081
00:28:58.431 --> 00:28:59.660
<v Speaker 4>you're going to start doing the mouth.</v>

1082
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.370
<v Speaker 4>You have the drips and stuff.</v>

1083
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 4>It felt like all of that.</v>

1084
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:02.960
<v Speaker 4>It was horrible.</v>

1085
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:29:03.321 --> 00:29:03.551
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1087
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty intense drug and I know people are taking it.</v>

1088
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.210
<v Speaker 4>I guess it gets prescribed for attention deficit disorder.</v>

1089
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just didn't feel as vibrant.</v>

1157
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 3>And then I started taking the vitamins again and then within a week I was like,</v>

1158
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:43.541
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1159
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I feel that good again.</v>

1160
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Like this has gotta be the vitamins.</v>

1161
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.863
<v Speaker 3>It must be.</v>

1162
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.041
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

1163
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:48.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1164
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be eating vegetables all fucking day.</v>

1165
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:50.951
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1167
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to beat and cheeseburgers and soda and whatever the fuck</v>

1168
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:54.724
<v Speaker 3>you're eating.</v>

1169
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean the amount of vitamins that you're supposed to get as opposed to what you</v>

1171
00:30:58.391 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 3>do get.</v>

1172
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.790
<v Speaker 3>And when you do give yourself what you need,</v>

1173
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:01.250
<v Speaker 3>like man,</v>

1174
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 3>it's just everything feels clean.</v>

1175
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Like it's working smooth,</v>

1176
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:04.410
<v Speaker 3>sweet.</v>

1177
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1178
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try this out and if it works,</v>

1179
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:07.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1180
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:08.111
<v Speaker 3>if it's a,</v>

1181
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:08.801
<v Speaker 3>if it becomes,</v>

1182
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1183
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 3>something that's uh,</v>

1184
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.691
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting,</v>

1185
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:11.524
<v Speaker 3>we'll start selling it.</v>

1186
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that something you have to get,</v>

1187
00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:13.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1188
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.361
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1189
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:13.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1190
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.321
<v Speaker 3>does he have to have like a,</v>

1191
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:17.760
<v Speaker 3>some kind of license to do this or is the question like the supplement thing,</v>

1192
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 3>you could pretty much do whatever you want to do.</v>

1193
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.841
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not,</v>

1194
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:20.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1195
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1196
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 3>the thing about it being like a,</v>

1197
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:22.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1198
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they're not regulated like the food and Drug Administration.</v>

1199
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not FDA regulated.</v>

1200
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1201
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:30.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's one of the problems with supplements.</v>

1202
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 3>They can say they do a lot of things,</v>

1203
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:32.914
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really do,</v>

1204
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1205
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1206
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell,</v>

1207
00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:35.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1208
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell what the fuck has rear re weird and yeah.</v>

1209
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 3>And then at one point in time they were going to call them a nutraceuticals and</v>

1210
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 3>they were going to have them prescribed,</v>

1211
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 3>it was a big push at the pharmaceutical companies did,</v>

1212
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the 90s to try to take over the vitamin business when they saw</v>

1213
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 3>that all these people were spending all this money on homeopathic,</v>

1214
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1215
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 3>cures and vitamins and stuff like that and health things.</v>

1216
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.131
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

1217
00:32:00.131 --> 00:32:00.221
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1218
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:00.431
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1219
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:00.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1220
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 3>we'll just fucking lock that shit down to like Monsanto was gonna fucking put a</v>

1221
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:08.140
<v Speaker 3>patent on vitamin C and the only way you get vitamin C is from Monsanto.</v>

1222
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1223
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1224
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 3>that's not outside the realm of possibility with corporate America the way what</v>

1225
00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 3>they've done with food in this country.</v>

1226
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 3>For folks that don't know,</v>

1227
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:16.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1228
00:32:16.031 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 3>you gotta watch this.</v>

1229
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Some of the documentaries that are available on Monsanto and see what they've</v>

1230
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

1231
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>they've basically done is they've genetically modified foods so that it doesn't,</v>

1232
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.650
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have the same effect when you spray pesticides on it,</v>

1233
00:32:28.651 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get killed by the same bugs.</v>

1234
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 3>They have a bunch of different things that they've done to various plants,</v>

1235
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 3>but once they have this genetically modified seed,</v>

1236
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 3>you owe them money.</v>

1237
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.581
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1238
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Speaker 3>this is how it works.</v>

1239
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 3>You can't just grow plants and then take the seeds from those plants and grow</v>

1240
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:46.191
<v Speaker 3>new plants.</v>

1241
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to do that.</v>

1242
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

1243
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>You have to buy a new set of seeds from them and you own those seeds just for</v>

1244
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 3>that season.</v>

1245
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.830
<v Speaker 3>You buy them,</v>

1246
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1247
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 3>you buy them to use them.</v>

1248
00:32:55.911 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like you lease them and then this is where you owe the money because their</v>

1249
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 3>seeds go in the air,</v>

1250
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know the cross pollination and they fucking fly off and land in some other</v>

1251
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 3>guy's field and he starts growing Monsanto genetically modified food,</v>

1252
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 3>and then they come in and they go,</v>

1253
00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:10.521
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1254
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.000
<v Speaker 3>you got our fucking corn grown bitch.</v>

1255
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:13.303
<v Speaker 3>You owe us money.</v>

1256
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 3>And they just take your money made.</v>

1257
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:15.681
<v Speaker 3>It becomes like a,</v>

1258
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 3>a crazy legal battle with these poor fucking farmers.</v>

1259
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1260
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1261
00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 3>and with Nikki could say that some of them might have stole the seeds,</v>

1262
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:22.881
<v Speaker 3>that's possible.</v>

1263
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:23.661
<v Speaker 3>But with a lot of them,</v>

1264
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:25.620
<v Speaker 3>it's been proven that it's just cross pollination.</v>

1265
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And so then it becomes a real trip because these people might be organic farmers</v>

1266
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:29.331
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1267
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>They don't want this mutant freak fucking genetically modified food grown on</v>

1268
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:33.334
<v Speaker 3>their soil.</v>

1269
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Monsanto is trying to be,</v>

1270
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to not just do that with food,</v>

1271
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:40.070
<v Speaker 3>but they're trying to do that with animal food.</v>

1272
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Had tried to do that with pigs.</v>

1273
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Like they're there,</v>

1274
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 3>they're patenting pig parts,</v>

1275
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:44.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1276
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 3>If they're genetically modifying pigs,</v>

1277
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 3>then they're going to patent those pig parts.</v>

1278
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is like,</v>

1279
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:52.210
<v Speaker 3>there's all this debate about them doing that because they're saying you're,</v>

1280
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.570
<v Speaker 3>you're patenting things that have already existed for like a million years.</v>

1281
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Like that's absolutely ridiculous.</v>

1282
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1283
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 3>You can't just patent fucking parts of animals and shit.</v>

1284
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Like you're going to make it.</v>

1285
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Can you make an animal that you own,</v>

1286
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 3>that you own the patent to it.</v>

1287
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And then like what if you want to commit genocide on the animal that you own and</v>

1288
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 3>you gotta just do that.</v>

1289
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Just shut them all off and you created it.</v>

1290
00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:14.991
<v Speaker 3>It's yours.</v>

1291
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 3>It's artificial.</v>

1292
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:21.220
<v Speaker 3>So it sounds like the same company that made robocop</v>

1293
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to unleash some terrible thing on the world.</v>

1294
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.251
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1296
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1297
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.571
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing,</v>

1298
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:30.404
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1299
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.670
<v Speaker 3>They filed in invention there.</v>

1300
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 3>They're filed a patent for the new invention.</v>

1301
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:35.121
<v Speaker 3>The pig.</v>

1302
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:36.770
<v Speaker 3>This is an article on Greenpeace.</v>

1303
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy,</v>

1304
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:38.640
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1305
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's very weird,</v>

1306
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:40.424
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1307
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 3>They called their invention the pig.</v>

1308
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:42.171
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1309
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:42.741
<v Speaker 3>it's a joke.</v>

1310
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:42.921
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1311
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the joke title of this,</v>

1312
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1313
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.581
<v Speaker 3>But they're,</v>

1314
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:47.720
<v Speaker 3>they're patent plans.</v>

1315
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.291
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1316
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:48.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1317
00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:49.150
<v Speaker 3>they're out there.</v>

1318
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.580
<v Speaker 3>The world's food supply don't pay.</v>

1319
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 3>They're out to own the world's food supply man.</v>

1320
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:54.321
<v Speaker 3>And they can,</v>

1321
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

1322
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1323
00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 3>it's just amazing that it's gotten to this point where they've let anybody put</v>

1324
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 3>any sort of a patent on life.</v>

1325
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I understand that once you start to alter that life,</v>

1326
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes a real question.</v>

1327
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1328
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.021
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1329
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:06.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:06.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1331
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:06.871
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1332
00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 3>you're really,</v>

1333
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1334
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.631
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>

1335
00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of playing God,</v>

1336
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.951
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1337
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you're genetically modifying the,</v>

1338
00:35:11.991 --> 00:35:12.580
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1339
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>the structure of a plant to your liking,</v>

1340
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 3>and then you own a patent on that piece of life.</v>

1341
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1342
00:35:19.671 --> 00:35:20.504
<v Speaker 3>it's not your path.</v>

1343
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.760
<v Speaker 3>We're allowing people to patent life.</v>

1344
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And if it sounds ridiculous with a pig,</v>

1345
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.631
<v Speaker 3>well guess what?</v>

1346
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just as ridiculous with a fucking head of lettuce.</v>

1347
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.951
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>

1348
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 3>It's all ridiculous.</v>

1349
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.810
<v Speaker 3>But a patent is,</v>

1350
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:30.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1351
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 3>the thing about it is,</v>

1352
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 3>is the most disturbing thing is the idea of some corporation just for profit</v>

1353
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Speaker 3>meddling with the DNA</v>

1354
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 6>of things that haven't been metaled with for a very long time.</v>

1355
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 6>That's bizarre.</v>

1356
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 6>That's much more bizarre than the patent because the patent,</v>

1357
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 6>just an imaginary thing anyway.</v>

1358
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:47.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:48.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1360
00:35:48.131 --> 00:35:48.401
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

1361
00:35:48.401 --> 00:35:52.630
<v Speaker 3>what's really scary about it is the idea that they can stop other people from</v>

1362
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:53.743
<v Speaker 3>growing it.</v>

1363
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 3>They can stop other people from having it.</v>

1364
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1365
00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:56.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1366
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm too nice.</v>

1367
00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:57.661
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

1368
00:35:57.661 --> 00:35:59.140
<v Speaker 6>must be naive right now because I,</v>

1369
00:35:59.141 --> 00:36:01.300
<v Speaker 6>this shit going on in Egypt and Libya,</v>

1370
00:36:01.301 --> 00:36:03.140
<v Speaker 6>it makes me think that they're,</v>

1371
00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.710
<v Speaker 6>the corporate bullshit like that is just such a,</v>

1372
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:05.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1373
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.120
<v Speaker 6>is a pipe dream.</v>

1374
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 6>Did they,</v>

1375
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.320
<v Speaker 6>they will invoke things like that and there'll be a period of time where the</v>

1376
00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:12.470
<v Speaker 6>belt gets too tight,</v>

1377
00:36:12.471 --> 00:36:14.440
<v Speaker 6>but I just don't think it works.</v>

1378
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on in Egypt and what's going on in Libya and what's</v>

1380
00:36:18.821 --> 00:36:20.170
<v Speaker 3>going on in Iran,</v>

1381
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.670
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think anything really happens without the CIA being involved.</v>

1382
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1383
00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:25.570
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1384
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

1385
00:36:26.531 --> 00:36:28.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think these things just start happening.</v>

1386
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I think someone,</v>

1387
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.750
<v Speaker 3>some fucking dude who works for America is over there and he's helping organize</v>

1388
00:36:34.751 --> 00:36:38.320
<v Speaker 3>shit and get people not to take anything away from the heroic effort that these</v>

1389
00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:39.154
<v Speaker 3>people have done.</v>

1390
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1391
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.680
<v Speaker 3>especially in Egypt and when Mubarak is gone,</v>

1392
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1393
00:36:42.161 --> 00:36:44.560
<v Speaker 3>and in Libya right now they're getting gunned down the street.</v>

1394
00:36:44.561 --> 00:36:45.161
<v Speaker 3>There's videos.</v>

1395
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a bunch of them online of people getting hit by snipers.</v>

1396
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.660
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking dark shit,</v>

1398
00:36:49.661 --> 00:36:49.871
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1399
00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:51.190
<v Speaker 3>They're just blowing dude's heads off.</v>

1400
00:36:51.191 --> 00:36:51.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1401
00:36:51.401 --> 00:36:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Middle of the streets.</v>

1402
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1403
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Not to take anything away from that.</v>

1404
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1405
00:36:55.031 --> 00:36:56.830
<v Speaker 3>these people really are doing something courageous,</v>

1406
00:36:56.831 --> 00:36:59.680
<v Speaker 3>but for sure there's some influence there for sure.</v>

1407
00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Our government's involved in everything.</v>

1408
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 6>I think our government does not want what's happening in the Middle East to be</v>

1409
00:37:05.671 --> 00:37:06.271
<v Speaker 6>happening.</v>

1410
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 6>And really if there are people out there,</v>

1411
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 6>if there's some conspiracy,</v>

1412
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.181
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1413
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 6>because you've got fucking,</v>

1414
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.953
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1415
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.340
<v Speaker 6>right after it.</v>

1416
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1417
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 6>right after everything went down in Egypt,</v>

1418
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:18.610
<v Speaker 6>they were showing pictures of Mubarak on,</v>

1419
00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 6>on mainstream press as though you're kind of a good guy.</v>

1420
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:21.961
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1421
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 6>it's so cool to watch mainstream news because it's like they have to spend a few</v>

1422
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 6>days deciding what tone they're going to take with it.</v>

1423
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:31.320
<v Speaker 6>And when the Egyptian revolution started,</v>

1424
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:34.380
<v Speaker 6>the United States government didn't come out and do much at all because they</v>

1425
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 6>were waiting to see if they would be able to push them down to hold them down.</v>

1426
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.551
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1427
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 6>And then they kind of came out in favor of the people,</v>

1428
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:41.791
<v Speaker 6>but they had to you.</v>

1429
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 6>But there's pictures of Obama meeting with him,</v>

1430
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1431
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 6>many presidents meeting with him.</v>

1432
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:48.181
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

1433
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 6>I think he was already ours.</v>

1434
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we want it to get rid of him.</v>

1435
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:52.940
<v Speaker 6>I think we liked him right where he was at.</v>

1436
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:53.741
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1437
00:37:53.741 --> 00:37:54.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you know though?</v>

1438
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:55.900
<v Speaker 3>It's all speculation.</v>

1439
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.750
<v Speaker 3>We might might've like run his course because at one point in time we wanted</v>

1440
00:37:58.751 --> 00:37:59.584
<v Speaker 3>Hussein in there.</v>

1441
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.910
<v Speaker 3>You know who's saying was our boards?</v>

1442
00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll Rumsfeld shaking his hands.</v>

1443
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.393
<v Speaker 3>A famous photo,</v>

1444
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1445
00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.520
<v Speaker 3>he was our guy over there when they were at war with Iran.</v>

1446
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.931
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1447
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:07.321
<v Speaker 6>unless,</v>

1448
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 6>I mean our guy,</v>

1449
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:09.220
<v Speaker 6>listen to me,</v>

1450
00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.790
<v Speaker 6>there's no way to like her teeth.</v>

1451
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.560
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't be surprised if,</v>

1452
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:13.810
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1453
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.643
<v Speaker 6>this is some,</v>

1454
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:15.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm,</v>

1455
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 6>I'm such a fucking new age hippie sometimes like,</v>

1456
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1457
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 6>2012 coming up and the acceleration of technology,</v>

1458
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:28.380
<v Speaker 6>what I like to think of this as is the beginning of people having the ability to</v>

1459
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 6>organize themselves in a way that's never been possible in human history.</v>

1460
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 6>Mixing in with the ability to get information that you could never get.</v>

1461
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.940
<v Speaker 6>So that motivates people to revolt against uh,</v>

1462
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:39.551
<v Speaker 6>liars.</v>

1463
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:40.800
<v Speaker 6>And that's what the Internet is doing.</v>

1464
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 6>Just showing who the fucking liars are out there.</v>

1465
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1466
00:38:43.741 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right about that.</v>

1467
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:45.840
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that as well.</v>

1468
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that,</v>

1469
00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:47.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1470
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.570
<v Speaker 3>the social media and you know,</v>

1471
00:38:48.571 --> 00:38:52.140
<v Speaker 3>using Facebook and Twitter to get messages out to where we're going to protest</v>

1472
00:38:52.141 --> 00:38:53.280
<v Speaker 3>and where are we going to meet and that they can,</v>

1473
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is one of the first things they did in Egypt and one of the first</v>

1474
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 3>things they did in Libya is cut off their,</v>

1475
00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.190
<v Speaker 3>their supplier of the Internet.</v>

1476
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 3>They cut off their connection or something.</v>

1477
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.830
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1478
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1479
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.060
<v Speaker 3>how might mean don't think that the CIA's and fucking super savvy about that</v>

1480
00:39:06.061 --> 00:39:06.840
<v Speaker 3>kind of shit too.</v>

1481
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.351
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1482
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Because of course they are.</v>

1483
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.791
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1484
00:39:08.791 --> 00:39:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's,</v>

1485
00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:10.710
<v Speaker 3>this isn't,</v>

1486
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1487
00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 3>it's not possible that it's just a plain old fashioned revolt.</v>

1488
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I just think that the United States is so clever about,</v>

1489
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1490
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.990
<v Speaker 3>the foreign policy and how they interfere with other countries that there,</v>

1491
00:39:21.991 --> 00:39:24.450
<v Speaker 3>they don't ever allow anything to really slip by.</v>

1492
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:24.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1493
00:39:24.991 --> 00:39:28.080
<v Speaker 3>when this guy got arrested in Pakistan for shooting down some people who tried</v>

1494
00:39:28.081 --> 00:39:31.650
<v Speaker 3>to rob them and then it turned out the guy was a CIA operative that was embedded</v>

1495
00:39:31.651 --> 00:39:32.630
<v Speaker 3>into the system over there.</v>

1496
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1497
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.200
<v Speaker 3>when you find out stuff like that,</v>

1498
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:34.441
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1499
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:34.681
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1500
00:39:34.681 --> 00:39:36.090
<v Speaker 3>how many of these guys are there?</v>

1501
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1502
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.290
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>

1503
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:37.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy and I've talked about it before.</v>

1505
00:39:39.481 --> 00:39:40.320
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like talking about it,</v>

1506
00:39:40.321 --> 00:39:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but his dad was in the CIA.</v>

1507
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.280
<v Speaker 3>He didn't find out until he was fucking 30 years old.</v>

1508
00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1509
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.221
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know.</v>

1510
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:47.130
<v Speaker 3>He thought he thought his dad was a banker.</v>

1511
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1512
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.320
<v Speaker 3>That's cool man.</v>

1513
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a trip.</v>

1514
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:50.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1515
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.390
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

1516
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.661
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1517
00:39:51.661 --> 00:39:52.530
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting.</v>

1518
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.320
<v Speaker 6>I think what happens is something like this goes down,</v>

1519
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 6>they have like,</v>

1520
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 6>they had statistics,</v>

1521
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 6>they probably had think tanks where like,</v>

1522
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:01.420
<v Speaker 6>here's a,</v>

1523
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 6>there's a possibility that this is going to happen in the Middle East.</v>

1524
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 6>And when it happens,</v>

1525
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 6>here's our plan.</v>

1526
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.200
<v Speaker 6>We know this guy out there,</v>

1527
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:09.011
<v Speaker 6>this guy out there,</v>

1528
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:09.791
<v Speaker 6>this guy out there,</v>

1529
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 6>then let's move in to try to,</v>

1530
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:11.981
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1531
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:12.814
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1532
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1533
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 6>make the situation to our advantage.</v>

1534
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:15.890
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>

1535
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:16.170
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1536
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:16.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1537
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:16.720
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1538
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm skeptical for no reason other than it just seems like this doesn't work with</v>

1539
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:25.400
<v Speaker 6>my understanding of the way a empire likes to run.</v>

1540
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1541
00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 6>it's my opinion that this is,</v>

1542
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:32.761
<v Speaker 6>that the people doing this more than it is a CIA instigated thing.</v>

1543
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 6>And I think even if it was a CIA instigated thing,</v>

1544
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 6>it might have turned into something they didn't expect.</v>

1545
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.040
<v Speaker 6>Cause really the,</v>

1546
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 6>the one thing we don't want over there is for a,</v>

1547
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:42.811
<v Speaker 6>what's it called?</v>

1548
00:40:42.811 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 6>At Hedge Hedge Hedge Lemoni.</v>

1549
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.960
<v Speaker 6>We don't want the fucking uh,</v>

1550
00:40:47.961 --> 00:40:49.380
<v Speaker 6>it to become a theocracy.</v>

1551
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1552
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.461
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1553
00:40:50.461 --> 00:40:53.270
<v Speaker 3>We don't want that because this is another thing that was concerned.</v>

1554
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

1555
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 3>but this Muslim Brotherhood thing that we keep hearing about lately,</v>

1556
00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:57.900
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1557
00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1558
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Who are they?</v>

1559
00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.760
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is this?</v>

1560
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Where is it?</v>

1561
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 3>How is this Jess coming up?</v>

1562
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Cause this is like an episode of lost where they,</v>

1563
00:41:05.431 --> 00:41:07.770
<v Speaker 3>there is the last season and you know,</v>

1564
00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:10.580
<v Speaker 3>they have to introduce some new character and this new magic guide.</v>

1565
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:14.130
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I fucking gave up on lost the last season.</v>

1566
00:41:14.131 --> 00:41:17.130
<v Speaker 3>We started bringing people back from the dead and Jack started walking through</v>

1567
00:41:17.131 --> 00:41:17.840
<v Speaker 3>his lines.</v>

1568
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1569
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.391
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1570
00:41:18.391 --> 00:41:19.020
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1571
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll never watch anything with that guy.</v>

1572
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.620
<v Speaker 3>You see the end and figuring out how it all makes sense.</v>

1573
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.180
<v Speaker 3>No it doesn't because I don't,</v>

1574
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.073
<v Speaker 3>they don't get me.</v>

1575
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.771
<v Speaker 3>You don't get me.</v>

1576
00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:27.120
<v Speaker 3>You ruined me Jack.</v>

1577
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.020
<v Speaker 3>You'll fuck I'm fucking goofball walking through all your scenes.</v>

1578
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>He just was mad that he wasn't like a cool guy anymore.</v>

1579
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Like he wasn't the beginning of the show.</v>

1580
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.141
<v Speaker 3>The beginning of the show.</v>

1581
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Jack was the bomb diggity he had great characters and amazing guy who's out</v>

1582
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:41.250
<v Speaker 3>there doing,</v>

1583
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 3>he was a fucking hero and it's somewhere along the line I bet that act or piss</v>

1584
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:48.340
<v Speaker 3>people off by being a content and they slowly started making him a continent and</v>

1585
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.090
<v Speaker 3>is you know,</v>

1586
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 3>became a junkie and a failure and a zero like his character like went into the</v>

1587
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 3>shitter hard in a way that you would never have expected from like the first</v>

1588
00:41:57.831 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

1589
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Like what the hell did that guy do behind the scene there with one of the</v>

1590
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:04.020
<v Speaker 3>writers and broke up with her.</v>

1591
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I think they just,</v>

1592
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 3>they get to know your real personality after awhile and I just started</v>

1593
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:12.001
<v Speaker 3>incorporating your,</v>

1594
00:42:12.001 --> 00:42:13.640
<v Speaker 3>your douche penis into the script,</v>

1595
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1596
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.810
<v Speaker 3>cause I know they do that on,</v>

1597
00:42:16.811 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 3>on shows all the time.</v>

1598
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 3>They do that on shows all the time and people can play apparent like that girl,</v>

1599
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.131
<v Speaker 3>what's her name?</v>

1600
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Catherine Heagle that's in like all those romantic movies that make you want to</v>

1601
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking hurl the movie with Josh Duhamel when they have to have a kid together</v>

1602
00:42:29.451 --> 00:42:30.284
<v Speaker 3>and they're not really,</v>

1603
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.540
<v Speaker 3>really the real parents and they fell in love.</v>

1604
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Well she was on that show.</v>

1605
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:40.380
<v Speaker 3>'Em The fuck is that stupid show with the doctor McDreamy whatever the fuck,</v>

1606
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.340
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1607
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.020
<v Speaker 3>You're not Grey's anatomy and uh,</v>

1608
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Speaker 3>apparently they just fucking,</v>

1609
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.830
<v Speaker 3>they started giving her like really shitty parts and not writing or into mosques</v>

1610
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 3>because she started getting an attitude.</v>

1611
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:52.180
<v Speaker 3>It did happen.</v>

1612
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.411
<v Speaker 3>Happens.</v>

1613
00:42:52.411 --> 00:42:52.781
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>

1614
00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 3>This is Charlie Sheen situation,</v>

1615
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1616
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Look what they've done with him.</v>

1617
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:57.710
<v Speaker 3>They cut off the last four seasons,</v>

1618
00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>the last four episodes of the season,</v>

1619
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:00.014
<v Speaker 3>they stopped filming.</v>

1620
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 3>That's going to cost Charlie $8 million and it's going to cost them a fuck load</v>

1621
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:04.821
<v Speaker 3>of money to,</v>

1622
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:07.660
<v Speaker 3>because they've already sold the advertising for those to Verde,</v>

1623
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.300
<v Speaker 3>like committed to selling them for syndication as a syndicated show.</v>

1624
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1625
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1626
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a big loss for them.</v>

1627
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 3>They're hoping that trolley pulls it together and then by the time it goes</v>

1628
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:17.361
<v Speaker 3>around next year,</v>

1629
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.410
<v Speaker 3>they can add four to next year and then you know,</v>

1630
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and make up for what they owe.</v>

1631
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:23.540
<v Speaker 3>So this is basically like for the corporations,</v>

1632
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 3>this is the same thing.</v>

1633
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 3>It's when like a Roman emperor emperor had a favorite gladiator and the people</v>

1634
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 3>loved the gladiator,</v>

1635
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 3>but he got a big hat and started going a little crazy.</v>

1636
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.841
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say.</v>

1637
00:43:33.841 --> 00:43:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Is there a little puppet?</v>

1638
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like miss firing a little bit.</v>

1639
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:37.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1640
00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:41.390
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a successful show without someone being a star.</v>

1641
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 3>They become a star.</v>

1642
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Whether they were a star at first like Charlie was already,</v>

1643
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 3>or whether they become one like Brett Butler or you know Chris Titus or anybody</v>

1644
00:43:49.191 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1645
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:50.121
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

1646
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:51.440
<v Speaker 3>when you get on a show,</v>

1647
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.701
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens.</v>

1648
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.890
<v Speaker 3>You get a successful show and all of a sudden this one person,</v>

1649
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean you really do fucking need that one person more than everyone else.</v>

1650
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really that a mind fuck.</v>

1651
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.340
<v Speaker 3>That's a mind fuck.</v>

1652
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Especially for actors because for a giant chunk of their life,</v>

1653
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily what Charlie Sheen,</v>

1654
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 3>he was pretty much instantly successful.</v>

1655
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.290
<v Speaker 3>But for most actors,</v>

1656
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:12.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a long series of failures and disappointments and rejections.</v>

1657
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 3>And then finally you make it with something and you have a fucking chip on your</v>

1658
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 3>shoulder for all those people that caused you pain.</v>

1659
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you how many conversations I've had famous dudes that we'll talk</v>

1660
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 3>about still to this day about horrible fucking casting sessions that they had</v>

1661
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:27.680
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

1662
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:27.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1663
00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 3>auditions where it went wrong and you know,</v>

1664
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:31.130
<v Speaker 3>all the scuffling around,</v>

1665
00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 3>all the humiliating auditions that they had to go on and on.</v>

1666
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:34.801
<v Speaker 3>It's like fucking,</v>

1667
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1668
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.440
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1669
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 3>they get in there and they,</v>

1670
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:37.711
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1671
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 3>they become famous and they just want to get back at all those people that hurt</v>

1673
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 3>them all that time.</v>

1674
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1675
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like they needed all that absorb exorbitant amount of attention.</v>

1676
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 3>They needed to be fucking special.</v>

1677
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:48.391
<v Speaker 3>And everyone was saying,</v>

1678
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:48.661
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1679
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1680
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:49.501
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1681
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1682
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:50.341
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1683
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1684
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.271
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1685
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:51.841
<v Speaker 3>you're normal.</v>

1686
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:52.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1687
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:52.891
<v Speaker 3>you're not good enough.</v>

1688
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:53.161
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1689
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:53.470
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1690
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1691
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 3>And then finally become famous.</v>

1692
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1693
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:55.943
<v Speaker 3>judge saw.</v>

1694
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1695
00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1696
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like this bounce back the other direction is so enormous because of how</v>

1697
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:02.214
<v Speaker 3>much is pushing,</v>

1698
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 3>pushing them down in the beginning.</v>

1699
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1700
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.170
<v Speaker 3>how they feel.</v>

1701
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:05.441
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1702
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:05.681
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1703
00:45:05.681 --> 00:45:05.981
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1704
00:45:05.981 --> 00:45:06.370
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1705
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 6>when you run into an actor or a comedian or anybody who seems proud of</v>

1706
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:14.044
<v Speaker 6>themselves,</v>

1707
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.190
<v Speaker 6>it's automatically so disappointing because it's like,</v>

1708
00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:18.850
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1709
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 6>you think you're right.</v>

1710
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.200
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's making this,</v>

1711
00:45:23.201 --> 00:45:24.370
<v Speaker 3>you think your,</v>

1712
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.220
<v Speaker 3>you really think you are responsible you.</v>

1713
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:28.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's the most,</v>

1714
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.170
<v Speaker 3>it's like a radio thinking that it's awesome for playing a song</v>

1715
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.810
<v Speaker 6>or a volcano thinking it's awesome for the lava that comes spraying out of it.</v>

1716
00:45:35.811 --> 00:45:36.560
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1717
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:36.921
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1718
00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:37.910
<v Speaker 6>you're kind of like,</v>

1719
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.451
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

1720
00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 6>you're a conduit.</v>

1721
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.490
<v Speaker 6>You're a conduit.</v>

1722
00:45:40.491 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 6>You're not the fucking thing man.</v>

1723
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.900
<v Speaker 6>Whenever</v>

1724
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 3>that sounds ridiculous to people that don't create things though.</v>

1725
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 3>And we talked to a person who is not creative.</v>

1726
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't write a lot or to perform a lot.</v>

1727
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.510
<v Speaker 3>They really don't have any idea what you're talking about.</v>

1728
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:51.961
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1729
00:45:51.961 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 3>And most people out there are not,</v>

1730
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 3>they don't make the living or living,</v>

1732
00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:56.840
<v Speaker 3>being creative.</v>

1733
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1734
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people never achieve that zen state where whatever you,</v>

1735
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 3>you've gotten good at it.</v>

1736
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's art or music or you know,</v>

1737
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:05.440
<v Speaker 3>the immediate even dance,</v>

1738
00:46:05.441 --> 00:46:06.031
<v Speaker 3>they say that.</v>

1739
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 3>And in martial arts I say that it's anything that you get really good at,</v>

1740
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 3>you get into this sort of zone where it's no longer you.</v>

1741
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've practiced it enough to the point where you can become</v>

1742
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 3>subconscious and then once you do it,</v>

1743
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're just tuning in,</v>

1744
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 3>you're tuning into whatever the fuck it is out there that makes things awesome</v>

1745
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 3>and people don't understand that they don't do it.</v>

1746
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like such an ether thorough,</v>

1747
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous notion,</v>

1748
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's so widely accepted.</v>

1749
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:31.441
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1750
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:31.681
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1751
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:31.981
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1752
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 3>the concept of the Muse,</v>

1753
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1754
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 3>it's so widely accepted that you're getting these ideas from somewhere else.</v>

1755
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 3>That's why I mean when you say,</v>

1756
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1757
00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to pretend that I'm not special,</v>

1758
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to pretend I'm not a freaking rock star from Mars.</v>

1759
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:44.281
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1760
00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:44.491
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

1761
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 3>when he hits says shit like that,</v>

1762
00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>like that is the exact opposite of the true creative mindset.</v>

1763
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Like you cannot tune in to the greatness of the universe if you really believe</v>

1764
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1765
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 3>unless it's performance art and then it's fucking brilliant,</v>

1766
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1767
00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>If he's really doing it,</v>

1768
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:00.450
<v Speaker 3>his own Coen brothers for sure.</v>

1769
00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:00.881
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1770
00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:01.151
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1771
00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:01.840
<v Speaker 6>Then yeah,</v>

1772
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.411
<v Speaker 6>I always,</v>

1773
00:47:02.411 --> 00:47:07.411
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how many times I've watched an asshole on TV and in the back of my</v>

1774
00:47:07.421 --> 00:47:09.580
<v Speaker 6>head thought if this was performance art,</v>

1775
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.280
<v Speaker 6>this will be the greatest artist of all time.</v>

1776
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1777
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:13.271
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1778
00:47:13.271 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 6>performance art turns everything into,</v>

1779
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.181
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1780
00:47:16.181 --> 00:47:17.050
<v Speaker 6>but don't you guys aren't,</v>

1781
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:20.470
<v Speaker 6>you guys were skeptical when you see people like Brody Stevens where the normal</v>

1782
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:20.801
<v Speaker 6>personal,</v>

1783
00:47:20.801 --> 00:47:21.880
<v Speaker 6>she bro Steven that go up,</v>

1784
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:24.730
<v Speaker 6>that person is just fucking crazy and angry map.</v>

1785
00:47:24.731 --> 00:47:26.530
<v Speaker 6>But then you talked to him backstage and you're like,</v>

1786
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:26.831
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1787
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

1788
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.910
<v Speaker 6>He is being almost like character of himself</v>

1789
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.281
<v Speaker 3>Brody.</v>

1790
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 3>So obviously a carrot it dude,</v>

1791
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:32.734
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

1792
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 3>most people think most people that see Brody think that that's,</v>

1793
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 3>that's him.</v>

1794
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:37.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1795
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a big devastating Brody,</v>

1796
00:47:38.551 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Stevens and Charlie Sheen,</v>

1797
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.910
<v Speaker 3>the huge difference between how they're doing it yet.</v>

1798
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 3>So I need this Brody's consent.</v>

1799
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:44.291
<v Speaker 3>Tell him jokes,</v>

1800
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.124
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1801
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1802
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.303
<v Speaker 3>Brody's going.</v>

1803
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I was over there in Iraq.</v>

1804
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.281
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1805
00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1806
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I was there.</v>

1807
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I was in Desert Storm.</v>

1808
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1809
00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 3>I was an Iraqi soldier.</v>

1810
00:47:56.951 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 3>But that's neither here or there.</v>

1811
00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 3>That's really obvious.</v>

1812
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:00.200
<v Speaker 3>He's joking.</v>

1813
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It's really what's,</v>

1814
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.291
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

1815
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 3>The redneck comic.</v>

1816
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:03.590
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

1817
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:03.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1818
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.220
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole character.</v>

1819
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 3>But the big guy that's on that tour with a,</v>

1820
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:07.864
<v Speaker 3>get her done,</v>

1821
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 3>get her done guy,</v>

1822
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.181
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

1823
00:48:09.181 --> 00:48:10.090
<v Speaker 3>He's a complete character.</v>

1824
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:11.950
<v Speaker 3>But even most people think that's exactly him.</v>

1825
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:12.540
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would,</v>

1826
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but that's just a good character.</v>

1827
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between that and an angry person.</v>

1828
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 3>An angry crazy person.</v>

1829
00:48:17.531 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 3>He's not acting crazy.</v>

1830
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 3>He's just being a character.</v>

1831
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1832
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.161
<v Speaker 3>He's funny,</v>

1833
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:21.431
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1834
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Brody is like Brody,</v>

1835
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 3>someone where if you,</v>

1836
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 3>no matter what's happening,</v>

1837
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 3>if you're around him,</v>

1838
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 3>something funny is happening.</v>

1839
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Like he has a constant gravity of absurd,</v>

1840
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 3>hilarious things happening.</v>

1841
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Either things that he's making happen or just stuff that happens.</v>

1842
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:37.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1843
00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:37.781
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1844
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1845
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't just think of him as being this,</v>

1846
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1847
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1848
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not like watching an asshole,</v>

1849
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1850
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:44.441
<v Speaker 3>and saying,</v>

1851
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:44.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 3>is this guy faking it?</v>

1853
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:45.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1854
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:46.421
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious.</v>

1855
00:48:46.421 --> 00:48:47.011
<v Speaker 3>He's faking it.</v>

1856
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:47.844
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1857
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to watch.</v>

1858
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:49.340
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

1859
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 3>when you watch something like real housewives of Beverly Hills and you see I'm</v>

1860
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 3>fucking Kelsey Grammer's ex wife.</v>

1861
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1862
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 3>What a reprehensible human being.</v>

1863
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:01.720

1907
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.600
<v Speaker 3>which is to do these things where you look at the way people dressed,</v>

1913
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.470
<v Speaker 3>It was a Kelsey Grammer standing there with Camille when she was in her prime.</v>

1914
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:23.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1915
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:25.150
<v Speaker 3>it's when she was a playboy playmate.</v>

1916
00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:26.620
<v Speaker 3>She was way too hot for him.</v>

1917
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.601
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's a story as old as time,</v>

1921
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 3>that's all the guy said.</v>

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Like whoever the writer was that said that.</v>

1923
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.091
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1924
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:35.630

<v Speaker 3>Tada.</v>

1935
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And he's so happy with themselves and he will go and do these interviews and</v>

1936
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:51.770
<v Speaker 3>talk about how much he loves her and how amazing it was.</v>

1937
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 3>And she completes it and then he leaves her for a flight attendant.</v>

1938
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fucking great stuff.</v>

1939
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 3>If she was doing performance art,</v>

1940
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 3>if she was faking it,</v>

1944
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 3>there's no way she's that good of an actress.</v>

1945
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:07.370
<v Speaker 3>She would have been fucking Oscar Wilde by now trying to be some 40 year old</v>

1946
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:07.791

1949
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.151
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1950
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:12.980
<v Speaker 3>before she was even divorced on the show.</v>

1951
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1954
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 3>But before she was even divorced with them,</v>

1955
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 3>she was hanging out with all these young guys that were her friends,</v>

<v Speaker 3>means,</v>

1990
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 3>but what they're saying is that there's an error in the orbit of the moon.</v>

2000
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:48.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2001

2004
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm an entire pretending I'm not delivering the fricking goods at every turn.</v>

2005
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>What they're saying is there's something wrong with the orbit of the moon that</v>

2006
00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 3>can be attributed to a large,</v>

2007
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:04.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2008
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 3>extra solar system planet.</v>

2009
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Like they're thinking there's something out there that's much,</v>

2010
00:53:08.721 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 3>much bigger than Jupiter.</v>

2011
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 3>About four times the size of Jupiter,</v>

2012
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

2013
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.320
<v Speaker 3>this is just one of several things that I've been following over the last couple</v>

2014
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.080
<v Speaker 3>of months where there's,</v>

2015
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of different studies that are talking about this planet x thing,</v>

2016
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's,</v>

2017
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 3>they're really close to saying that there is something beyond Neptune,</v>

2018
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 3>beyond Pluto is not real anymore.</v>

2019
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 3>But something out there like way out there that's four times the size of</v>

2020
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.544
<v Speaker 3>Jupiter,</v>

2021
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 3>some enormous fucking planet.</v>

2022
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

2023
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>How have we missed it?</v>

2024
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2025
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:41.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a big question.</v>

2026
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:42.683
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

2027
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 3>It might be just so fucking far out there.</v>

2028
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 3>It might be really cold so we can't see it.</v>

2029
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:47.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2030
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 3>they're thinking that this thing is by calling it inside our solar system.</v>

2031
00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 3>I think what they're saying is that it's more,</v>

2032
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it's further away from Pluto than Pluto is from us,</v>

2033
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 3>but yet it's still in some sort of an orbit and it's huge and it's way out</v>

2034
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:02.990
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2035
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 3>So this is like,</v>

2036
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 3>this is the planet acts Nibiru thing.</v>

2037
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:11.511
<v Speaker 3>Everyone talks about the idea that it smashes into us every certain amount of</v>

2038
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2039
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2040
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 3>it depends on who you're asking.</v>

2041
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:13.701
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2042
00:54:13.701 --> 00:54:14.890
<v Speaker 3>do you know if you,</v>

2043
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to,</v>

2044
00:54:15.881 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2045
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.700
<v Speaker 3>the people that believe that,</v>

2046
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:17.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2047
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.780
<v Speaker 3>the earth was created this way and the,</v>

2048
00:54:19.781 --> 00:54:20.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2049
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:20.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2050
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 3>it's actually detailed according to Zechariah Cichon in the Sumerian text,</v>

2051
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.990
<v Speaker 3>what they think is that,</v>

2052
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 3>that somehow or another,</v>

2053
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 3>this extra solar planet or this planet is on an elliptical orbit rather.</v>

2054
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:31.981
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2055
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:32.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2056
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 3>it takes 3000,</v>

2057
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:36.360
<v Speaker 3>600 years to come into line with a,</v>

2058
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 3>with earth and it comes near us and fucks everything up.</v>

2059
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 3>And then the Annunaki jump off and they,</v>

2060
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:43.770
<v Speaker 3>they lived off their boat onto our boat and go,</v>

2061
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:43.951
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2062
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:44.784
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over here?</v>

2063
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.540
<v Speaker 3>And then they come check us out and then make us slaves for a little bit,</v>

2064
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 3>make us mined for gold and erase our memories and fly back in the space.</v>

2065
00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:50.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2066
00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck think exactly thing,</v>

2067
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:54.120
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2068
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:55.051
<v Speaker 3>when you look at,</v>

2069
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2070
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2071
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2072
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.941
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

2073
00:54:56.941 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 3>the really interesting shit about what they figured out was that they already</v>

2074
00:55:00.061 --> 00:55:01.330
<v Speaker 3>knew back then the,</v>

2075
00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

2076
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.820
<v Speaker 3>according to Zacharias itching that earth had been hit by a large planet and</v>

2077
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 3>that's what created the moon.</v>

2078
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.930
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that until like fairly recently.</v>

2079
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the most recent theories.</v>

2080
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 3>There's earth one and earth too and earth one was hit by something like the size</v>

2081
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:19.630
<v Speaker 3>of fucking Mars or some enormous planet and it created also,</v>

2082
00:55:19.631 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 3>it created the asteroid belt.</v>

2083
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 3>That's another theory about that.</v>

2084
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2085
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.161
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2086
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:23.994
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant,</v>

2087
00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 3>this is another thing I read them.</v>

2088
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I need to find out if this is true or not.</v>

2089
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:32.390
<v Speaker 3>But that bodes law is a law that you look at the gravity of one planet and you</v>

2090
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 3>can extrapolate where the next planet will be based on,</v>

2091
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2092
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 3>how dense the planet is and what the gravity of it is and that what the mass of</v>

2093
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:41.130
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2094
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 3>And it works on every planet in our solar system except for Mars and Jupiter.</v>

2095
00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 3>And that there's should be a planet in between there.</v>

2096
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the asteroid belt is.</v>

2097
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.400
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that,</v>

2098
00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:50.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
00:55:50.671 --> 00:55:54.720
<v Speaker 3>something was there collided with a reason why there's not a planet there.</v>

2100
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.553
<v Speaker 3>Did they have any?</v>

2101
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:56.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2102
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2103
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.001
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2104
00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of theories about why the asteroid belt exists,</v>

2105
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2106
00:56:00.181 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 3>and one of them being that it's like some of the early,</v>

2107
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:04.201
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2108
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:06.390
<v Speaker 3>the fabric of the very solar system that it's just like,</v>

2109
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:06.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2110
00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:07.770
<v Speaker 3>from the forming of the solar system,</v>

2111
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

2112
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:08.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2113
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 3>some just leftover shit that's there.</v>

2114
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.250
<v Speaker 3>And then the other one is that it's a planet and got fucking nailed and just</v>

2115
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 3>destroyed and became this gigantic belt of rocks and shit.</v>

2116
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

2117
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 3>The idea that planets,</v>

2118
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:25.690
<v Speaker 3>we know this for a fact that not only do planet slam into each other,</v>

2119
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 3>but galaxy slam into each other,</v>

2120
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2121
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 3>They hit each other.</v>

2122
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:30.453
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2123
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Fucking a man.</v>

2124
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:32.291
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine,</v>

2125
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 3>look up in the sky and every day this like star just keeps getting brighter,</v>

2126
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2127
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and you're some asshole caveman,</v>

2128
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:43.240
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea what the fuck is really going on and this thing is coming down</v>

2129
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:45.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to slam it to the moon and you know,</v>

2130
00:56:45.231 --> 00:56:46.890
<v Speaker 3>and kill everybody there.</v>

2131
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 3>So there's also,</v>

2132
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of theories about the solar system that are really odd and some of</v>

2133
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 3>them that some of the planets that exist now weren't there before.</v>

2134
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:54.514
<v Speaker 3>Like Saturn.</v>

2135
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 3>The Saturn is a fairly recent occurrence in the solar system.</v>

2136
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2137
00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a total horse shit.</v>

2138
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Start exposing herself.</v>

2139
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2140
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.030
<v Speaker 3>you know the idea on,</v>

2141
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 3>on planets that,</v>

2142
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:05.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2143
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 3>like rogue planets,</v>

2144
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2145
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.640
<v Speaker 3>they get sucked in front.</v>

2146
00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

2147
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.720
<v Speaker 3>they come from somewhere else and they get sucked into our solar system and gets</v>

2148
00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 3>sucked into our gravity or any other source systems.</v>

2149
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Gravity.</v>

2150
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:17.141
<v Speaker 3>And there's a,</v>

2151
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 3>an interesting thing about this Pluto,</v>

2152
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.810
<v Speaker 3>this planet that's outside of Pluto is that they're saying the gravity of this</v>

2153
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:22.931
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2154
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:24.200
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why they,</v>

2155
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 3>they figured out that there's something huge out there.</v>

2156
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.650
<v Speaker 3>The gravity of this thing is hurling comments in our direction.</v>

2157
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 7>Weird</v>

2158
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.140
<v Speaker 7>fucking weird man.</v>

2159
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 7>You never know.</v>

2160
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:38.480
<v Speaker 7>Like the thing that freaks me out is that a,</v>

2161
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.151
<v Speaker 7>what do they call it?</v>

2162
00:57:39.151 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 7>Pulse ours or they say like a [inaudible] star close enough can have like a</v>

2163
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 7>super pulse that just flashes hyper Nova,</v>

2164
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 7>hyper Nova and were just dead instantly.</v>

2165
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 7>Like you're just driving home and suddenly the sky turns,</v>

2166
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.330
<v Speaker 7>you drive home and you get an Smi hits you,</v>

2167
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.120
<v Speaker 7>you're just dead,</v>

2168
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2169
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:56.343
<v Speaker 7>same shit.</v>

2170
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.450
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of different.</v>

2171
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.450
<v Speaker 7>Know you'd booked di both things getting Super Nova and a semi hit like this and</v>

2172
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:02.930
<v Speaker 7>mine.</v>

2173
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:03.930
<v Speaker 7>A supernova.</v>

2174
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.611
<v Speaker 3>Well for you,</v>

2175
00:58:05.611 --> 00:58:05.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2176
00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>

2177
00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.060
<v Speaker 3>if you're a selfish con doesn't think about the whole</v>

2178
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 8>rest of the world.</v>

2179
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2180
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 8>It's the same thing Brian.</v>

2181
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.940
<v Speaker 8>It's just like me taking pills.</v>

2182
00:58:15.941 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 8>The world will die right now.</v>

2183
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 8>I want to listen to some fucking music.</v>

2184
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:20.981
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2185
00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 7>you might,</v>

2186
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.530
<v Speaker 7>you might not know the difference or you might,</v>

2187
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Speaker 7>did you see that new,</v>

2188
00:58:24.521 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 7>a LCD screen that Microsoft announced the other day or then this is like they</v>

2189
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 7>showed what's in their labs right now,</v>

2190
00:58:30.431 --> 00:58:33.550
<v Speaker 7>what they're working on with the future of LCD screens on,</v>

2191
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.563
<v Speaker 7>it's called a</v>

2192
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:40.060
<v Speaker 7>steerable auto stereo three d display.</v>

2193
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:41.440
<v Speaker 7>And what's cool is it's like,</v>

2194
00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty much like a a surface and you can see the surface.</v>

2195
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:49.150
<v Speaker 7>So imagine like an iPad on a table but really big kind of like their,</v>

2196
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 7>their Microsoft surface and surface.</v>

2197
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2198
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:51.731
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2199
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 7>but now you can grab things and it knows how the distance up and down is.</v>

2200
00:58:56.021 --> 00:59:00.040
<v Speaker 7>And you could do like three d kind of like kind of just like the future when you</v>

2201
00:59:00.041 --> 00:59:03.250
<v Speaker 7>see in the movies where they're like pulling up displays and tapping things and</v>

2202
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:04.084
<v Speaker 7>stuff like that.</v>

2203
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 7>And they have this really cool video.</v>

2204
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.110
<v Speaker 7>The name of the video is called Applied Sciences Group.</v>

2205
00:59:09.111 --> 00:59:10.810
<v Speaker 7>Smart interactive displays.</v>

2206
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.673
<v Speaker 7>Microsoft.</v>

2207
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.280
<v Speaker 7>So great man.</v>

2208
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:13.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2209
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:13.951
<v Speaker 7>I'll,</v>

2210
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 7>I'll tweet it.</v>

2211
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 7>And what's so cool about it,</v>

2212
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:16.331
<v Speaker 7>it's just the,</v>

2213
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:17.110
<v Speaker 7>the future of,</v>

2214
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2215
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 7>like surfing the Internet and pretty soon you're just gonna be like this.</v>

2216
00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:21.370
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going to pull up,</v>

2217
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.221
<v Speaker 7>take your hand,</v>

2218
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 7>grab at a browser,</v>

2219
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:24.051
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2220
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:28.250
<v Speaker 7>just sit there and play with like air and you're going to be able to like just,</v>

2221
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:28.581
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2222
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:29.650
<v Speaker 7>move things around.</v>

2223
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.090
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2224
00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:33.190
<v Speaker 7>it's intertwined like connect or Microsoft surfaces.</v>

2225
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 7>Everything's going to become an interactive surface no matter what it is.</v>

2226
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 7>You won't be able to sell shit unless it's got like some access to the internet,</v>

2227
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 7>everything like this table,</v>

2228
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

2229
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.960
<v Speaker 7>But what's cool is the depth of it.</v>

2230
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:45.651
<v Speaker 7>And they also,</v>

2231
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:46.281
<v Speaker 7>in the same video,</v>

2232
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:51.281
<v Speaker 7>they were showing the future 3d where like where it's a flashing these lights at</v>

2233
00:59:51.831 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 7>your face so fast that you can't even tell.</v>

2234
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 7>So we will give you three d images without,</v>

2235
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2236
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 7>the glasses of course.</v>

2237
00:59:57.111 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 7>But it shows how they do it and he goes into it and explains and shows how it</v>

2238
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.011
<v Speaker 7>works and stuff.</v>

2239
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty interesting video.</v>

2240
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 7>I'll post it right there.</v>

2241
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.993
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2242
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 9>It's trippy shit.</v>

2243
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.750
<v Speaker 9>He saw this,</v>

2244
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2245
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 9>this planet thing is really fucking freaking me out,</v>

2246
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 9>mom.</v>

2247
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.173
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

2248
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:14.561
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2249
01:00:14.561 --> 01:00:18.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean a lot of this stuff like something that I think about all the time,</v>

2250
01:00:18.251 --> 01:00:22.690
<v Speaker 7>it's like how much are we affected by the solar flares?</v>

2251
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.290
<v Speaker 7>And like a sociological way and it's such a crazy idea,</v>

2252
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:26.810
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

2253
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.030
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

2254
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:30.740
<v Speaker 9>it's not if he considered that the moon's orbit affects people's behavior,</v>

2255
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:31.270
<v Speaker 9>is that,</v>

2256
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 9>I mean there's say there's no statistics to back up,</v>

2257
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:34.791
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2258
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 9>like that there's more activity during lunar,</v>

2259
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2260
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.390
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2261
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.223
<v Speaker 9>other events.</v>

2262
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:39.801
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

2263
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:40.310
<v Speaker 9>Isn't that true?</v>

2264
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 9>There's no,</v>

2265
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 9>there's no statistics to back that up.</v>

2266
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:42.920
<v Speaker 9>Isn't that true?</v>

2267
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.260
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2268
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 7>I cause cops always swear by it.</v>

2269
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:45.871
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2270
01:00:45.871 --> 01:00:46.130
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2271
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 7>I think there are,</v>

2272
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 7>I've heard,</v>

2273
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.291
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2274
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.720
<v Speaker 7>I never really investigated and,</v>

2275
01:00:49.721 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 7>but I always thought that was true.</v>

2276
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.970
<v Speaker 7>But if they can figure out that there's a planet deep,</v>

2277
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:56.451
<v Speaker 7>deep,</v>

2278
01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:57.111
<v Speaker 7>somewhere in the,</v>

2279
01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 7>in our galaxy that they don't know about,</v>

2280
01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:02.660
<v Speaker 7>just from the effect that it has on the moon's gravitational field,</v>

2281
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 7>then that means it must be having an effect on us too.</v>

2282
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 7>Like if it's literally like some planet far away,</v>

2283
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:12.790
<v Speaker 7>it's so powerful that it's altering the moon a little bit and it would be a fact</v>

2284
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 7>that same minor pole,</v>

2285
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 7>it'd be affecting us too.</v>

2286
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 7>Maybe the storms,</v>

2287
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:18.201
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2288
01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:19.034
<v Speaker 7>maybe the weather</v>

2289
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:19.991
<v Speaker 9>it does.</v>

2290
01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:20.231
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2291
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:20.761
<v Speaker 9>look at what,</v>

2292
01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:21.700
<v Speaker 9>what sun does.</v>

2293
01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:23.180
<v Speaker 9>Just lack of vitamin D.</v>

2294
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:23.351
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2295
01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:25.270
<v Speaker 9>we know it actually makes something in your body.</v>

2296
01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:28.750
<v Speaker 9>It actually causes a vitamin to be produced by your body that makes you happy.</v>

2297
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.340
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2298
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:29.511
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

2299
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.450
<v Speaker 9>the aides and your happiness and your health.</v>

2300
01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.640
<v Speaker 9>And when you don't get that all the time,</v>

2301
01:01:33.641 --> 01:01:33.851
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2302
01:01:33.851 --> 01:01:34.690
<v Speaker 9>for long periods of time,</v>

2303
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.130
<v Speaker 9>people get sick and depressed.</v>

2304
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.993
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2305
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:37.570
<v Speaker 9>they have,</v>

2306
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.550
<v Speaker 9>it's called seasonal affective disorder.</v>

2307
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:40.031
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:40.570
<v Speaker 9>I mean that,</v>

2309
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:41.590
<v Speaker 9>that's seasonal.</v>

2310
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Speaker 9>If you're in a place where,</v>

2311
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.660
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2312
01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.800
<v Speaker 9>that is a seasonal event,</v>

2313
01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.810
<v Speaker 9>like in Boston and Boston during the winter,</v>

2314
01:01:46.811 --> 01:01:48.820
<v Speaker 9>people do get depressed and that's why it's,</v>

2315
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:49.743
<v Speaker 9>it's called,</v>

2316
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.030
<v Speaker 9>it's vitamin D deficient.</v>

2317
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:51.730
<v Speaker 9>It's a lot of it,</v>

2318
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:52.481
<v Speaker 9>but it's also just,</v>

2319
01:01:52.481 --> 01:01:53.650
<v Speaker 9>it's fucking dreary.</v>

2320
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:53.921
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2321
01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:54.551
<v Speaker 7>That's what it is.</v>

2322
01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:55.570
<v Speaker 7>Sunlight lamps,</v>

2323
01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:56.231
<v Speaker 7>they're supposed to help.</v>

2324
01:01:56.231 --> 01:01:57.220
<v Speaker 7>Did you knew it's snowed in?</v>

2325
01:01:57.221 --> 01:01:58.030
<v Speaker 7>Burbank.</v>

2326
01:01:58.030 --> 01:01:58.420
<v Speaker 7>Did it?</v>

2327
01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:58.740
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>

2328
01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:02.200
<v Speaker 7>I it like huge chunks of snow fell from that ground.</v>

2329
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.291
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2330
01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:04.960
<v Speaker 7>two days ago I went outside hail or snow?</v>

2331
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.270
<v Speaker 7>Well it wasn't hail because hail is usually hard,</v>

2332
01:02:07.271 --> 01:02:10.120
<v Speaker 7>but it seemed like really like wet snow.</v>

2333
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:10.570
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2334
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:13.300
<v Speaker 7>But they covered the whole roads and stuff like that.</v>

2335
01:02:13.301 --> 01:02:14.410
<v Speaker 7>And were you driving?</v>

2336
01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:14.621
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2337
01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:17.590
<v Speaker 7>it was really early in the morning and then it melted super quick.</v>

2338
01:02:17.591 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 7>But I mean it snowed all day.</v>

2339
01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 7>It ridiculous.</v>

2340
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2341
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.021
<v Speaker 3>Well this,</v>

2342
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 3>this and a couple of websites here I'm looking at when it comes to the moon and</v>

2343
01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 3>one of them saying that the claims of a correlation between lunar phases to</v>

2344
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 3>human behavior does not hold up under scientific scrutiny.</v>

2345
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.220
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying so they're saying that there's,</v>

2346
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 3>there's no connection.</v>

2347
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 3>But then other people were saying that there is a connection.</v>

2348
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

2349
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Other people think that,</v>

2350
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.773
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2351
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:43.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2352
01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.034
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2353
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it's really difficult to quantify,</v>

2354
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2355
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

2356
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.320
<v Speaker 3>how do you know,</v>

2357
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 3>like if it really is a psycho,</v>

2358
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.351
<v Speaker 3>how do you know?</v>

2359
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean whether or not it's actually called,</v>

2360
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:54.090
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>

2361
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to see just by like hospital reports and prison and you know</v>

2362
01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 3>police records and when shouldn't you be able to see?</v>

2363
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine so meaning if it's a little bit of a difference,</v>

2364
01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>like a 1% difference,</v>

2365
01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 4>maybe it should be able to see,</v>

2366
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:10.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's like that it's just small enough that it's the rate of accuracy.</v>

2367
01:03:10.031 --> 01:03:10.541
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2368
01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Like this test is only 99% accurate,</v>

2369
01:03:12.761 --> 01:03:13.930
<v Speaker 4>so it's kind of like the,</v>

2370
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:16.930
<v Speaker 4>you know the up down ratio.</v>

2371
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:20.790
<v Speaker 3>This is this one side is saying despite the fact that no evidence of significant</v>

2373
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 3>correlation between phases of the moon,</v>

2374
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 3>dimensional cycle and fertility exist,</v>

2375
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>some people not only maintain that there is but have a scientific explanation</v>

2376
01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 3>for the non existent correlation.</v>

2377
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 3>It could be that just people want to believe it or could be just like people</v>

2378
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 3>would go nutty because back in the day it was like bright outside at night.</v>

2379
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before you had to watch where the fuck you walked and it was super dark</v>

2380
01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2381
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:41.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2382
01:03:41.521 --> 01:03:44.430
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of times a year or a couple of times a month rather,</v>

2383
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:44.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2384
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:49.701
<v Speaker 3>for a few days you get a giant spotlight in the sky and so you could walk around</v>

2385
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:51.084
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

2386
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.931
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2387
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 3>And probably people did nuttier shit.</v>

2388
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.070
<v Speaker 4>If the moon affects the tides is powerful enough to make tides come in and</v>

2389
01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.860
<v Speaker 4>tagged it can,</v>

2390
01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I could totally see how it affect whatever weird oceans in your brain,</v>

2391
01:04:04.071 --> 01:04:06.560
<v Speaker 4>whatever quantum motions floating around up there.</v>

2392
01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:08.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it affects that.</v>

2393
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:08.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2394
01:04:08.331 --> 01:04:09.170
<v Speaker 3>there's that question,</v>

2395
01:04:09.171 --> 01:04:09.381
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2396
01:04:09.381 --> 01:04:11.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like how much of you are,</v>

2397
01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.930
<v Speaker 3>is the chemical reactions it's going in your body and how much of that can you</v>

2398
01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:15.620
<v Speaker 3>manipulate?</v>

2399
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.240
<v Speaker 3>How much of that can you manipulate with,</v>

2400
01:04:17.241 --> 01:04:17.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2401
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.640
<v Speaker 3>an exercise to maintain your hormone levels and for drinking water to maintain</v>

2402
01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:24.080
<v Speaker 3>your hydration.</v>

2403
01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:24.914
<v Speaker 3>So you're not,</v>

2404
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:25.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2405
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.520
<v Speaker 3>how much of you is a bunch of these chemical reactions?</v>

2406
01:04:28.521 --> 01:04:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2407
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:30.380
<v Speaker 3>what your personality,</v>

2408
01:04:30.381 --> 01:04:33.170
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is dictated by what you're taking into your body?</v>

2409
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:34.723
<v Speaker 3>It's quiet.</v>

2410
01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:38.150
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be a percentage that that's a much bigger percentage than the</v>

2411
01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:38.984
<v Speaker 3>fucking moon.</v>

2412
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.151
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2413
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>one thing's for certain.</v>

2414
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 4>If you are in pain,</v>

2415
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.930
<v Speaker 4>you're going to probably be an asshole to the people around you in some way.</v>

2416
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 4>If you're fucking hurting.</v>

2417
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:52.110
<v Speaker 4>You know the old classic when you walk into the dishwasher with your Shin and</v>

2418
01:04:52.111 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 4>somebody nearby and says anything to you like,</v>

2419
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:55.481
<v Speaker 4>are you okay?</v>

2420
01:04:55.481 --> 01:04:56.041
<v Speaker 4>I'm Oh,</v>

2421
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:56.960
<v Speaker 4>good fun.</v>

2422
01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.060
<v Speaker 4>Cause it hurts so bad.</v>

2423
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.291
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2424
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:01.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2425
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 4>so if you're in pain,</v>

2426
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:04.730
<v Speaker 4>if you feel like shit in,</v>

2427

2428
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 4>you feel like shit for whatever reason,</v>

2429
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 4>you're probably treating the people around you like shit.</v>

2430
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 4>He know the opposite of it.</v>

2431

<v Speaker 4>Take Ecstasy and sit next to the stupidest person on the planet.</v>

01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:24.521
<v Speaker 6>You're okay.</v>

2443
01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 6>But that's not good.</v>

2444
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.463
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2445
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.121
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2446
01:05:27.121 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 6>is it,</v>

2447
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 6>is it,</v>

2448
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:28.691
<v Speaker 6>or is it,</v>

2449
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:28.901
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2450
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 6>is it good to be in wonder of everyone even retards,</v>

2451
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.101
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2452
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.030
<v Speaker 6>Or is it,</v>

2453
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:34.953
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

2454
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 6>I think at the,</v>

2455
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2456
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.293
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a,</v>

2457
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.600
<v Speaker 6>whenever you get around that kind of energy coming from someone where for</v>

2458
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:43.301
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason,</v>

2459
01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 6>when you run into someone really smart,</v>

2460
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:48.340
<v Speaker 6>you get the sense that they've managed to turn the judgment thing off and their</v>

2461
01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:51.570
<v Speaker 6>computer and they just like you just because you're a,</v>

2462
01:05:51.571 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 6>you're having this bizarre experience on the planet with them and they kind of</v>

2463
01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:56.194
<v Speaker 6>get it.</v>

2464
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.990
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the most healing things</v>

2465
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:02.010
<v Speaker 9>I used to at one point in my life when when someone would be judging me and I</v>

2466
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 9>would know they would be judging me,</v>

2467
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 9>I would feel insecure,</v>

2468
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 9>I would get upset.</v>

2469
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:06.191
<v Speaker 9>I would get like,</v>

2470
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:06.611
<v Speaker 9>wow,</v>

2471
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:06.881
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2472
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:07.331
<v Speaker 9>like man,</v>

2473
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.670
<v Speaker 9>maybe I'm a loser or maybe you know,</v>

2474
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:08.951
<v Speaker 9>I would,</v>

2475
01:06:08.951 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 9>if I felt like I was being,</v>

2476
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2477
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.800
<v Speaker 9>unfairly scrutinized,</v>

2478
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 9>I would just think it was,</v>

2479
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.481
<v Speaker 9>I'm just,</v>

2480
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 9>obviously I'm a loser.</v>

2481
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:14.891
<v Speaker 9>I'm losing it.</v>

2482
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 9>This whatever this is right now and this is,</v>

2483
01:06:16.631 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 9>this person doesn't like me.</v>

2484
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 9>Now I have a completely different effect now when someone,</v>

2485
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 9>I feel like someone is judging me or someone's being hypercritical or Shitty to</v>

2486
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:24.371
<v Speaker 9>me,</v>

2487
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:24.940
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

2488
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.340
<v Speaker 9>why are you being a cunt?</v>

2489
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

2490
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 9>Because I'm nice.</v>

2491
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.211
<v Speaker 9>You know?</v>

2492
01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:29.260
<v Speaker 9>I tried to be nice to everybody.</v>

2493
01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 9>Like there's no reason why this has to be a douchey conversation.</v>

2494
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:32.180
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2495
01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:32.600
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

2496
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 9>if it's Douchey,</v>

2497
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:34.180
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

2498
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 9>you're the one who started the Douchey knows.</v>

2499
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:35.990
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.640
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2501
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 9>and I think for a lot of people,</v>

2502
01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:38.891
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

2503
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:42.280
<v Speaker 9>that's like one of the biggest things that they worry about in life is getting</v>

2504
01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Speaker 9>judged and criticized and shit.</v>

2505
01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:45.870
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2506
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.280
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.390
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible when you're in,</v>

2508
01:06:47.391 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 6>especially if you're a kid and you're around one of the powerful personalities,</v>

2509
01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.480
<v Speaker 6>like decided that you're bad,</v>

2510
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 6>you're a loser,</v>

2511
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.240
<v Speaker 6>you down and draws that out of you.</v>

2512
01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 6>It's not like we're talking about the gravity of the planet.</v>

2513
01:06:57.911 --> 01:06:59.690
<v Speaker 6>It's like if someone's judging you,</v>

2514
01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 6>there's a gravity that they're exerting on you that can lead you into being the</v>

2515
01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:06.200
<v Speaker 6>thing that they think you are.</v>

2516
01:07:06.201 --> 01:07:06.680
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2517
01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.600
<v Speaker 6>what's that bizarre idea where I,</v>

2518
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:13.070
<v Speaker 6>it's the observers effect when you're looking at an an Adam or an electron or a</v>

2519
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:13.551
<v Speaker 6>photon.</v>

2520
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:16.850
<v Speaker 6>I think it is that weird thing where at the quantum level,</v>

2521
01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.210
<v Speaker 6>things seem to go in the direction of the way you expect them to.</v>

2522
01:07:20.211 --> 01:07:21.830
<v Speaker 6>They seem to be where you're looking.</v>

2523
01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 6>It's affected by you viewing this,</v>

2524
01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:24.100
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2525
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:24.470
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2526
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.770
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2527
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:26.450
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the name for that and I probably just butchered it,</v>

2528
01:07:26.451 --> 01:07:31.451
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying is I think that that can happen when you're around someone who</v>

2529
01:07:32.061 --> 01:07:34.430
<v Speaker 6>has a firm belief that you suck,</v>

2530
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.660
<v Speaker 6>you can suddenly,</v>

2531
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:38.510
<v Speaker 6>it'll start drawing out of you the shitty behavior.</v>

2532
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:42.800
<v Speaker 6>Cause it's like you will start blossoming out of you and it fucking sucks.</v>

2533
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:43.341
<v Speaker 6>In the same way,</v>

2534
01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:45.020
<v Speaker 6>if you're around somebody who's,</v>

2535
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:47.750
<v Speaker 6>who really sees you and sees how cool you are,</v>

2536
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.760
<v Speaker 6>then all of a sudden you're funnier.</v>

2537
01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:50.250
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

2539
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:50.811
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2540
01:07:50.811 --> 01:07:54.740
<v Speaker 6>Because they're drawing the positive out of you when you first start dating girl</v>

2541
01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:56.150
<v Speaker 6>and she really likes you and she's really,</v>

2542
01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.313
<v Speaker 6>how funny are you?</v>

2543
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.333
<v Speaker 6>The funniest?</v>

2544
01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:58.741
<v Speaker 9>Funny.</v>

01:07:58.741 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 9>You're hilarious.</v>

2546
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.240
<v Speaker 9>Every time you go to the movie,</v>

2547
01:08:00.241 --> 01:08:01.950
<v Speaker 9>you have the wideness shit to say,</v>

2548
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.001
<v Speaker 9>you go out to dinner,</v>

2549
01:08:03.001 --> 01:08:04.200
<v Speaker 9>you have the funniest thing to say.</v>

2550
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:04.561

<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2555
01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:09.120
<v Speaker 9>started out doing stand up comedy.</v>

2556
01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:11.820
<v Speaker 9>The reason why they got funny was to make girls laugh,</v>

2557
01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:12.471
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

2558
01:08:12.471 --> 01:08:12.731
<v Speaker 9>Or they,</v>

2559
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 9>they started out like trying to be the most and fun</v>

2560
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>guy in the beginning of the relationship when you first meet each other.</v>

2561
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2562

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2563
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:19.760

2564
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.593
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

2565
01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm way funnier when I'm broken now.</v>

2566
01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:23.144
<v Speaker 1>Miserable,</v>

2569
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm happy.</v>

2570
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:27.314
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not,</v>

2571
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm being nice and funny to that person,</v>

2572
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but like when I'm miserable,</v>

2573
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I fucking think of evil,</v>

2574
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:32.271
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

2575
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:32.631
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

2576
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:33.321
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

2577
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It seems like to me.</v>

2578
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>But when you're around someone like,</v>

2579
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>but imagine when you're around someone who you know,</v>

2580
01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>thinks that you are a fucking asshole.</v>

2581
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.111
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

2582
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:42.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2583
01:08:42.501 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>thinks that you're a moron and you're around them.</v>

2584
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I think Brian's just talking about performing on stage.</v>

2585
01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:47.471
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2586
01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:47.601
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2587
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:47.941
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2588
01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of going off in a different direction.</v>

2589
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:50.700
<v Speaker 1>But I know what you're saying.</v>

2590
01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>What saying you need like,</v>

2591
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:52.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2592
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>that was kinnisons whole thing.</v>

2593
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2594
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Kennison became really funny because of pain.</v>

2595
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2596
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:56.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2597
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:57.140
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

2598
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I was married for two fucking years,</v>

2600
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2601
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:05.200
<v Speaker 1>this second man is happy because all that shit was his,</v>

2602
01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2603
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:05.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2604
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't him happy.</v>

2605
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.790
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't,</v>

2606
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.043
<v Speaker 1>beautiful life.</v>

2608
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:09.561
<v Speaker 6>Well see,</v>

2609
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:10.311
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing man,</v>

2610
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 6>this idea of happiness.</v>

2611
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:14.150
<v Speaker 6>We were just talking about it on my podcast and someone's was like,</v>

2612
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.740
<v Speaker 6>why are you obsessed with being happy?</v>

2613
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:17.420
<v Speaker 6>Being happy is not what life's about.</v>

2614
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:18.231
<v Speaker 6>It's not about getting,</v>

2615
01:09:18.231 --> 01:09:19.064
<v Speaker 6>it's not about,</v>

2616
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2617
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh I feel good today.</v>

2618
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 6>It said that it was,</v>

2619
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:22.970
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2620
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:26.140
<v Speaker 6>they made a really good point because I,</v>

2621
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:31.190
<v Speaker 6>happiness and sadness are two sides of the same thing that if you pay too much</v>

2622
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 6>attention to them,</v>

2623
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:32.990
<v Speaker 6>you'll be,</v>

2624
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 6>you'll begin to get caught up in like chaos and randomness.</v>

2625
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:38.140
<v Speaker 6>It's a okay.</v>

2626
01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.541
<v Speaker 6>In the,</v>

2627
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.380
<v Speaker 6>in the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

2628
01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 6>there is this great verse that says,</v>

2629
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:46.331
<v Speaker 6>a wise man is not distressed or is not disturbed by either happiness or sadness.</v>

2630
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 6>There's your mind is,</v>

2631
01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 6>does not shift according to your mood states.</v>

2632
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 6>You're not plugging into the chemical,</v>

2633
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2634
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 6>the chemicals that are making you feel stressed out or making you feel happy.</v>

2635
01:09:59.160 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2636
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 6>you're above it.</v>

2637
01:10:00.561 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 6>You're transcendent,</v>

2638
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 6>you've transcended it.</v>

2639
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:03.980
<v Speaker 6>And that's what I think happiness.</v>

2640
01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 6>It would be a,</v>

2641
01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:07.160
<v Speaker 6>as opposed to the other kind of happiness,</v>

2642
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:08.570
<v Speaker 6>which you were saying isn't that bad,</v>

2643
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:13.571
<v Speaker 6>which is the ecstasy happiness or the kind of like a happiness that comes when</v>

2644
01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:18.490
<v Speaker 6>Charlie Sheen does align of blow or the kind of hat that kind of happiness and</v>

2645
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.790
<v Speaker 6>reduces the Moseley.</v>

2646
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:20.991
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly.</v>

2647
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:23.180
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he's really a on cocaine at all.</v>

2648
01:10:23.181 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he's on any drugs except Charlie's shade,</v>

2649
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 6>which is apparently the name of some new kind of mess.</v>

2650
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.590
<v Speaker 6>It's really just a new method they invented.</v>

2651
01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:31.760
<v Speaker 6>We'll call this sheen.</v>

2652
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.310
<v Speaker 6>But I think that,</v>

2653
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.530
<v Speaker 6>so that's my idea of happiness is not to get caught up in the mood states</v>

2654
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.790
<v Speaker 6>whether you're,</v>

2655
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 6>cause you're going to feel like,</v>

2656
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.004
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>

2657
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:44.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm on this planet.</v>

2658
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 6>You have to feel like you will feel like shit.</v>

2659
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

2660
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.490
<v Speaker 6>Because everyone you know is going to die.</v>

2661
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>And if they don't,</v>

2662
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.160
<v Speaker 6>it's because you died before them.</v>

2663
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.390
<v Speaker 6>And when someone dies,</v>

2664
01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:54.930
<v Speaker 6>it's sucks and you're right.</v>

2665
01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:55.110
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

2666
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that's just when someone dies.</v>

2667
01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:57.631
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2668
01:10:57.631 --> 01:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people think that your everyday life has to be filled with shit</v>

2669
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>and that you have to,</v>

2670
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>that's part of being a human and that happiness is,</v>

2671
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that happiness is somehow another transcending above emotions?</v>

2672
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>

2673
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I think my,</v>

2674
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>my personal happiness has been fun.</v>

2675
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.761
<v Speaker 9>It has been.</v>

2676
01:11:14.761 --> 01:11:15.594
<v Speaker 9>Laughter,</v>

2677
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:16.800
<v Speaker 9>having a good time,</v>

2678
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 9>hanging out with friends,</v>

2679
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 9>laughing with friends,</v>

2680
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.041
<v Speaker 9>laughing,</v>

2681
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 9>doing shows,</v>

2682
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.170
<v Speaker 9>laughing on stage.</v>

2683
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:22.860
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>

2684
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 9>that's real happiness.</v>

2685
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:25.920
<v Speaker 9>So is happiness possible?</v>

2686
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 9>But you gotta be around a bunch of other people that also commit to the same</v>

2688
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 9>ideas.</v>

2689
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 9>You have to be around a bunch of other really fun,</v>

2690
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:32.551
<v Speaker 9>happy people.</v>

2691
01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 9>It's very difficult to go it on your own.</v>

2692
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.810
<v Speaker 9>The only way you can is if somehow or another you attract people as you're going</v>

2693
01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 9>on your own and you committed to a life of happiness that also like kind of like</v>

2694
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Speaker 9>catching into your vibe and then pick up what you're doing and do the same thing</v>

2695
01:11:47.131 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 9>and then you,</v>

2696
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 9>you gravitate more people.</v>

2697
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 9>But you can do it.</v>

2698
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:53.580
<v Speaker 9>And I don't think it has to be that you have to be above happiness.</v>

2699
01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:54.470
<v Speaker 9>And it's like my,</v>

2700
01:11:54.471 --> 01:11:56.100
<v Speaker 9>my concept of guerrilla Buddhism,</v>

2701
01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:56.851
<v Speaker 9>I told you this before,</v>

2702
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 9>like people always say that,</v>

2703
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.321
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2704
01:11:58.321 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2705
01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 9>to be truly happy,</v>

2706
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 9>you cannot be attached to objects and you know,</v>

2707
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

2708
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.330
<v Speaker 9>you should be.</v>

2709
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 9>You should transcend objects and material possessions.</v>

2710
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 9>I say horse shit.</v>

2711
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 9>I say material possessions are fucking awesome.</v>

2712
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.840
<v Speaker 9>Some cars are bad ass.</v>

2713
01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:11.641
<v Speaker 9>I'm the drive.</v>

2714
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:14.610
<v Speaker 9>TV's are awesome to own stereos or great to listen to,</v>

2715
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.001
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2716
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 9>it's cool to eat a good meal.</v>

2717
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 9>It's nice to live in a house that's cool to look at.</v>

2718
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:18.870
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2719
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:20.100
<v Speaker 9>these are all good things.</v>

2720
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 9>The problem is for most people,</v>

2721
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 9>you become so attached to them because they're so difficult to attain.</v>

2722
01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 9>So the true way of enlightenment isn't to just be without any possessions.</v>

2723
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 9>The true way is to get to a point where you don't worry about the possessions,</v>

2724
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 9>but you appreciate them when they're there.</v>

2725
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.690
<v Speaker 9>It's not that you become completely attached to them,</v>

2726
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 9>but the only way to really do that I think is to make enough money so that it's</v>

2727
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 9>not that big a deal.</v>

2728
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 9>If someone steals your car,</v>

2729
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.670
<v Speaker 9>you can just get enough</v>

2730
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:42.870
<v Speaker 6>correct.</v>

2731
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:43.670
<v Speaker 6>The thing you,</v>

2732
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:48.440
<v Speaker 6>the thing people like about possessions is not the possession.</v>

2733
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.460
<v Speaker 6>The thing people like is the way the possession makes them feel.</v>

2734
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:56.900
<v Speaker 6>The feeling state that is induced from the thing,</v>

2735
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2736
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.771
<v Speaker 6>It's you know,</v>

2737
01:12:57.771 --> 01:12:58.750
<v Speaker 6>like so exam for,</v>

2738
01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.060
<v Speaker 6>so people like feeling in love and people like um,</v>

2739
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.050
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2740
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 6>people at begin to associate the,</v>

2741
01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.100
<v Speaker 6>the person in their wife,</v>

2742
01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:07.641
<v Speaker 6>the what I,</v>

2743
01:13:07.641 --> 01:13:12.641
<v Speaker 6>whoever they're dating or married to or whatever is the thing that's invoking</v>

2744
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:18.070
<v Speaker 6>that love there attached to the aspect of the material universe that's creating</v>

2745
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:19.064
<v Speaker 6>the feeling.</v>

2746
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.590
<v Speaker 6>And I think that there's a place,</v>

2747
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.500
<v Speaker 6>and maybe it's a legendary and I'm,</v>

2748
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.120
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't even believe in it,</v>

2749
01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.560
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of,</v>

2750
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:28.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2751
01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:28.881
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the,</v>

2752
01:13:28.881 --> 01:13:29.714
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2753
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 6>saints and a lot of gurus and a lot of people who seem very advanced seem to</v>

2754
01:13:34.371 --> 01:13:38.660
<v Speaker 6>point to a place that is not dependent on being triggered by things in the</v>

2755
01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:39.470
<v Speaker 6>material universe.</v>

2756
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:40.100
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>

2757
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.100
<v Speaker 6>the feeling that you get from amazing stuff is a preexisting feeling inside of</v>

2758
01:13:45.291 --> 01:13:45.471
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

2759
01:13:45.471 --> 01:13:49.250
<v Speaker 6>You already have that inside of you and you're letting stuff be the excuse to</v>

2760
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:50.084
<v Speaker 6>feel that way.</v>

2761
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:55.330
<v Speaker 6>Whereas the idea is you can pop into a state where you're always experiencing</v>

2762
01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.840
<v Speaker 6>that type of excitement and pleasure that you've limited to.</v>

2763
01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.980
<v Speaker 6>If I get a great job,</v>

2764
01:14:00.981 --> 01:14:01.940
<v Speaker 6>if I get a nice house,</v>

2765
01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:04.160
<v Speaker 6>if I book some other thing again,</v>

2766
01:14:04.161 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 6>or if I get a brand new car,</v>

2767
01:14:05.211 --> 01:14:06.680
<v Speaker 6>if I get the new Mac,</v>

2768
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:08.000
<v Speaker 6>I'll feel out.</v>

2769
01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:08.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to feel great.</v>

2770
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 6>That</v>

2771
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 9>old Buddha quote enlightenment as possible in this lifetime.</v>

2772
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2773
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

2774
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Can it be both?</v>

2775
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Can't you have a bad ass car and still try to be enlightened?</v>

2776
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:20.074
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

2777
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2778
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing that's either,</v>

2779
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.331
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something,</v>

2780
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:26.770
<v Speaker 1>there's something negative about issuing those things about about a week or two.</v>

2781
01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's retarded because then you get fucking people who are lying to</v>

2782
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>themselves in pretending to be a certain way because that how many people drive</v>

2783
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>a Prius just for the social work</v>

2784
01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 10>and environmental is</v>

2785
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.290
<v Speaker 10>sweeter.</v>

2786
01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people buy just from the mileage.</v>

2787
01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:44.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm down here.</v>

2788
01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:44.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2789
01:14:44.611 --> 01:14:45.444
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2790
01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2791
01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:47.850
<v Speaker 1>What Brad Pitt doesn't.</v>

2792
01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2793
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:49.111
<v Speaker 1>No people.</v>

2794
01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:49.944
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

2795
01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:51.203
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

2796
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2797
01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.220
<v Speaker 1>people want to put off.</v>

2798
01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2799
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.320
<v Speaker 1>they want to put off meditating or experimenting with different forms of</v>

2800
01:14:58.321 --> 01:15:01.860
<v Speaker 1>spirituality and tell they're good until they feel like they're perfect.</v>

2801
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.930
<v Speaker 1>They want to approach their like,</v>

2802
01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:04.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2803
01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be happy soon,</v>

2804
01:15:05.341 --> 01:15:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but let me get rid of this other shit first.</v>

2805
01:15:07.081 --> 01:15:07.914
<v Speaker 1>I got to take care of this.</v>

2806
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.113
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>

2807
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.070
<v Speaker 1>The idea is you approach,</v>

2808
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2809
01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:15.450
<v Speaker 1>understanding yourself and the universe and your connection to the universe.</v>

2810
01:15:15.451 --> 01:15:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Not from a place where you think you're going to be,</v>

2811
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.500
<v Speaker 1>but from where you are right now.</v>

2812
01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2813
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Some filthy,</v>

2814
01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.130
<v Speaker 1>filthy you no matter what.</v>

2815
01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:24.720
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't really meditated a lot,</v>

2816
01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:27.300
<v Speaker 1>the chances are you're absorbed in some,</v>

2817
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.141
<v Speaker 1>if you're on earth,</v>

2818
01:15:28.141 --> 01:15:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you're absorbed in some really stupid,</v>

2819
01:15:30.271 --> 01:15:31.170
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

2820
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you wait until you're better balanced to start meditating,</v>

2821
01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:34.861
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2822
01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to meditate.</v>

2823
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2824
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get into just from exactly where you're at is,</v>

2825
01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2826
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

2827
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2828
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 1>a fucking sex crazed beast or an alcoholic or with seven heroin needles falling</v>

2829
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:49.104
<v Speaker 1>out of your arm.</v>

2830
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Approach it from that place.</v>

2831
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you start getting really core results,</v>

2832
01:15:52.891 --> 01:15:53.061
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

2833
01:15:53.061 --> 01:15:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

2834
01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:55.590
<v Speaker 1>when you come at it from where it's like everything else,</v>

2835
01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you just have to do it.</v>

2836
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:56.821
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2837
01:15:56.821 --> 01:15:57.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2838
01:15:57.001 --> 01:15:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start exercising soon.</v>

2839
01:15:58.441 --> 01:15:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to quit smoking soon.</v>

2840
01:15:59.520 --> 01:15:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2841
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.543
<v Speaker 1>we'll do this.</v>

2842
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Just start doing it.</v>

2843
01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:01.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2844
01:16:01.921 --> 01:16:03.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as everything else.</v>

2845
01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Say you have to somehow or another trigger that that action and your,</v>

2846
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:10.620
<v Speaker 1>your brain to force your body to move in the direction of wherever the fuck it</v>

2847
01:16:10.621 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 1>is you need to do.</v>

2848
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2849
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2850
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.710
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we can hack our brains in the future.</v>

2851
01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Where will we know exactly what to do or to,</v>

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:58.680

2881
01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2882
01:16:59.071 --> 01:16:59.251
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

2883
01:16:59.251 --> 01:17:00.180
<v Speaker 1>you're in the interviews.</v>

2884
01:17:00.181 --> 01:17:00.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2885
01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the great things about being a mortal is just the Yummy Cox.</v>

2886
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a mortal,</v>

2887
01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's meant well.</v>

2888
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2889
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's easily possible that they could fuck up the first couple of times.</v>

2890
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I try to rewire the brain and just create psychopaths.</v>

2891
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea of going to the gym and putting my brain in the same place where</v>

2892
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:24.281
<v Speaker 3>the kids play it while my body goes and works out to be the fucking best.</v>

2893
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that if there was a place where you could go,</v>

2894
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:31.451
<v Speaker 3>where you could go and just lie down in a machine and the body would be like</v>

2895
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:37.160
<v Speaker 3>forced to do all this work without you ever having to like exert effort mentally</v>

2896
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>

2897
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you'd be down with that?</v>

2898
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2899
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>

2900
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2901
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:42.240
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2902
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 3>You would miss out the whole thing.</v>

2903
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.030
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is developing the,</v>

2904
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 3>the the character to push through the hard workout,</v>

2905
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:54.401
<v Speaker 3>which elevates your human potential or starcraft while your body is working</v>

2906
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 3>at your body.</v>

2907
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Did the hard part,</v>

2908
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.850
<v Speaker 3>but that's how you develop character though.</v>

2909
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a big way.</v>

2910
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.221
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2911
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:04.580
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2912
01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 3>there's something that's definitely to be learned from separating your body and</v>

2913
01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 3>your mind and forcing your body to work for your mind.</v>

2914
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Or your body's struggling.</v>

2915
01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Your body wants to quit and you go,</v>

2916
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:14.451
<v Speaker 3>shut up,</v>

2917
01:18:14.451 --> 01:18:14.810
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

2918
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:15.643
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>

2919
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:16.341
<v Speaker 3>And then when it's over,</v>

2920
01:18:16.341 --> 01:18:16.611
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2921
01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:17.060
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2922
01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:17.511
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>

2923
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:18.141
<v Speaker 3>I got through it.</v>

2924
01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:21.290
<v Speaker 3>This is a tough struggle because when you're doing like you ever do body weight</v>

2925
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:21.950
<v Speaker 3>squats,</v>

2926
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.390
<v Speaker 3>you know what they are Hindu squats.</v>

2927
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Ah Yeah.</v>

2928
01:18:24.711 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I think I tried squats.</v>

2929
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Well it's very easy to do one,</v>

2930
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2931
01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 3>anybody can go down on your,</v>

2932
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:30.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2933
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 3>put to the your ass to the back of your ankles and then stand back up again.</v>

2934
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:34.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard.</v>

2935
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Very few people could do 500 and it's one of those things when you start doing</v>

2936
01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:39.200
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2937
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:39.441
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2938
01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:39.681
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2939
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:40.341
<v Speaker 3>you get into it,</v>

2940
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you'd do like 25 and then you're like,</v>

2941
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2942
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.700
<v Speaker 3>26 27 and the lactic burn,</v>

2943
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2944
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2945
01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 3>the muscle burn your legs towards getting pretty intense.</v>

2946
01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:52.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a difficult thing to do.</v>

2947
01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not difficult to just stand up.</v>

2948
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 3>So in your mind it's very hard to accept that you should.</v>

2949
01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 3>When when she just stopped,</v>

2950
01:18:57.651 --> 01:18:58.161
<v Speaker 3>she just stopped.</v>

2951
01:18:58.161 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Now I can't do another one and you can't stand up.</v>

2952
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.800
<v Speaker 3>You really can't stand up one more time just with your own body weight.</v>

2953
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:09.010
<v Speaker 3>So you have to like figure out how to order your brain to work for you and push</v>

2954
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 3>through it and sometimes for like a couple of minutes you'll be an agony taking</v>

2955
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:18.010
<v Speaker 3>big deep breaths and then push out another one and go down and dig deep resume.</v>

2956
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:18.851
<v Speaker 3>When do you want to quit?</v>

2957
01:19:18.851 --> 01:19:21.800
<v Speaker 3>What you want to quit it like 25 or 26 when it starts getting a little bit</v>

2958
01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:22.600
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>

2959
01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.361
<v Speaker 3>your brain starts going,</v>

2960
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:23.601
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2961
01:19:23.601 --> 01:19:24.050
<v Speaker 3>let's stop.</v>

2962
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.501
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop,</v>

2963
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:25.130
<v Speaker 3>let's stop.</v>

2964
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Your body's going,</v>

2965
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm sending you these signals.</v>

2966
01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 3>This shit is not fun.</v>

2967
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:28.671
<v Speaker 3>Let's cut it off.</v>

2968
01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to figure out a way to to manage that and balance that at</v>

2969
01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:32.421
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>

2970
01:19:32.421 --> 01:19:33.200
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

2971
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Once you do have the ability to push yourself through brutal workouts,</v>

2972
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.780
<v Speaker 3>push yourself through like Jujitsu class,</v>

2973
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing class and stuff like that.</v>

2974
01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:41.080
<v Speaker 3>When it's,</v>

2975
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:41.350
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2976
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you've developed like character,</v>

2977
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you develop something new,</v>

2978
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:44.530
<v Speaker 3>developed a,</v>

2979
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.050
<v Speaker 3>a control over your body.</v>

2980
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>The average person doesn't have,</v>

2981
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2982
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Like those fucking guys who can do,</v>

2983
01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:49.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2984
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:50.330

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.350

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 3>a free divers that I respect the shit out of that.</v>

2987
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a crazy thing,</v>

2988
01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 3>but some of those guys who can go into water for like seven.</v>

2989
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy,</v>

2990
01:19:59.331 --> 01:19:59.631

2992
01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:01.600

2993
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck?</v>

2994
01:20:03.531 --> 01:20:08.531
<v Speaker 3>How do you power over your body using your mind and your willpower to control</v>

2995
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 3>your body?</v>

2996
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.231
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2997
01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:10.561
<v Speaker 3>it has to,</v>

2998
01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:11.650
<v Speaker 3>it takes a long time for them to,</v>

2999
01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 3>to get up to that,</v>

3000
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.950
<v Speaker 3>that amount of your breath.</v>

3001
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 3>But God made it perfect example.</v>

3002
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Like every second you want to quit every God damn second your body's sending</v>

3003
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:20.071
<v Speaker 3>signals.</v>

3004
01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3005
01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:20.351
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3006
01:20:20.351 --> 01:20:20.731
<v Speaker 6>for now,</v>

3007
01:20:20.731 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 6>for now it's a mirror.</v>

3008
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 6>When I was in Hawaii stone out of my mind from drinking pot tincture,</v>

3009
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:30.930
<v Speaker 6>we went snorkeling and there was our group snorkeling and then I realized there</v>

3010
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:35.931
<v Speaker 6>was a guy with a snorkel who wasn't in our group and there's no boat anywhere to</v>

3011
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:37.081
<v Speaker 6>be seen.</v>

3012
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:39.360
<v Speaker 6>And like land is far the fuck away.</v>

3013
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.820
<v Speaker 6>And this guy swimming around and like we're all snorkeling,</v>

3014
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:46.440
<v Speaker 6>he goes under and I'm watching him go way,</v>

3015
01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:46.861
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

3016
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:47.221
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

3017
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:47.581
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

3018
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:48.301
<v Speaker 6>way down.</v>

3019
01:20:48.301 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 6>And he's staying down there and he knows we're watching him.</v>

3020
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.520
<v Speaker 6>And he stayed down there for an impossibly long time.</v>

3021
01:20:53.521 --> 01:20:54.354
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

3022
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:55.260
<v Speaker 6>it went from me being like,</v>

3023
01:20:55.261 --> 01:20:55.471
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3024
01:20:55.471 --> 01:20:58.200
<v Speaker 6>that guy is great until like my heart started beating because I was like,</v>

3025
01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck,</v>

3026
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.400
<v Speaker 6>I think this guy is drowning.</v>

3027
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 6>I think this guy's going to die.</v>

3028
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 6>He turns over on his back,</v>

3029
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:05.190
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3030
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 6>And his arms go out loose and limp and his body starts floating up to the</v>

3031
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:10.584
<v Speaker 6>surface.</v>

3032
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.950
<v Speaker 6>And then he just smiles and waves that if he was faking drowning because he</v>

3033
01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 6>could just hold his breath so fucking long.</v>

3034
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:19.650
<v Speaker 6>And I guess like one of the things he liked to do in Hawaii was the snorkel out</v>

3035
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 6>to the groups and make them maybe in drowned.</v>

3036
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.640
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

3037
01:21:23.641 --> 01:21:26.420
<v Speaker 6>So he practices his free diving by freaking heat.</v>

3038
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 6>Cause I really thought he was,</v>

3039
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:28.671
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

3040
01:21:28.671 --> 01:21:28.920
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

3041
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.170
<v Speaker 6>he was under so impossibly long.</v>

3042
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>

3043
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:33.143
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

3044
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.410
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

3045
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.801
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3046
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:35.670
<v Speaker 6>man like that.</v>

3047
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 6>I would love to be able to do that.</v>

3048
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 6>That would be so amazing.</v>

3049
01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty awesome man.</v>

3050
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.960
<v Speaker 6>You must have the most healthy lungs to be able to do that.</v>

3051
01:21:44.961 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 6>That guy's probably never even had secondhand smoke.</v>

3052
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.050
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3053
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.321
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3054
01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something you build up to.</v>

3055
01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something just like everything else,</v>

3056
01:21:51.681 --> 01:21:51.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3057
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 3>like the only way you can do 500 bodyweight squats as he got to start off at 25</v>

3058
01:21:56.001 --> 01:21:59.320
<v Speaker 3>and work your way up to 500 I think they just developed the ability to,</v>

3059
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.850
<v Speaker 3>to hold their breath for,</v>

3060
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I know Egan Anyway,</v>

3061
01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:02.541
<v Speaker 3>who is a,</v>

3062
01:22:02.541 --> 01:22:03.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3063
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.010
<v Speaker 3>an MMA fighter.</v>

3064
01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Him and his brother Ensign,</v>

3065
01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:07.300
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty famous pioneers and uh,</v>

3066
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.791
<v Speaker 3>his brother,</v>

3067
01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Egan is a famous for being a free diver.</v>

3068
01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I think he won like some sort of crazy title and I'm like,</v>

3069
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I think at one point in time you'd like held his breath the longest longer than</v>

3070
01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:18.290
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>

3071
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3072
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure like navy seals and shit,</v>

3073
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.320
<v Speaker 3>a trainee to do that.</v>

3074
01:22:21.321 --> 01:22:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's part of bootcamp.</v>

3075
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3076
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Probably I would imagine.</v>

3077
01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:23.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3078
01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.111
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3079
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I told you about my friend Eric,</v>

3080
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:26.031
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

3081
01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

3082
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the guy who went to uh,</v>

3083
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.800
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3084
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.101
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3085
01:22:28.101 --> 01:22:31.850
<v Speaker 3>he's makes pool cues and makes his bad ass pool cues and the military and he had</v>

3086
01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:34.310
<v Speaker 3>tried out for the seals and one of the things they make you do,</v>

3087
01:22:34.311 --> 01:22:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was the seals.</v>

3088
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

3089
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:37.370
<v Speaker 3>what other might have been one of the special forces.</v>

3090
01:22:37.371 --> 01:22:41.790
<v Speaker 3>What are the other other groups like that they make you drown like you,</v>

3091
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>you literally go underwater until bubbles come up and then your,</v>

3092
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.250
<v Speaker 3>your team has to rescue you.</v>

3093
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:49.010
<v Speaker 3>So you have to trust in them to bring you back to life.</v>

3094
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you go unconscious.</v>

3095
01:22:50.361 --> 01:22:51.170
<v Speaker 3>You drown.</v>

3096
01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:53.120
<v Speaker 3>They pull you out before your body is totally dead.</v>

3097
01:22:53.121 --> 01:22:54.260
<v Speaker 3>They pumped the water out of you,</v>

3098
01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:56.390
<v Speaker 3>they give you CPR and then they bring you back to life.</v>

3099
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:57.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's when he was like,</v>

3100
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.370
<v Speaker 3>I tap,</v>

3101
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:59.203
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

3102
01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3103
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I got to stay up for days and go run it through the woods.</v>

3104
01:23:02.301 --> 01:23:04.040
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not gonna let you drown me.</v>

3105
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that video on the Internet?</v>

3106
01:23:05.441 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>There's an video</v>

3107
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet of an artist doing that,</v>

3108
01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 1>drowning himself in his bathtub.</v>

3109
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:09.904
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>

3110
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:10.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3111
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:15.511
<v Speaker 1>I him and brings him back to way he puts up a fucking concrete block on his</v>

3112
01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>chest and his bathtub drowns it cause,</v>

3113
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.370
<v Speaker 1>cause basically there's it,</v>

3114
01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>when you suck in water,</v>

3115
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a reaction.</v>

3116
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think your body as we're automatically knocks you on conscious.</v>

3117
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:27.011
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3118
01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>he knew he would go out and his friend had to resuscitate him.</v>

3119
01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3120
01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it?</v>

3121
01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3122
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I think look up performance artists drown self and bathtub.</v>

3123
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess like I'm telling you how to Google or both internet junkies go to the</v>

3124
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:46.711
<v Speaker 1>Google website and type prefer bing me to drown the live performance art</v>

3125
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:53.320
<v Speaker 1>performance stunt talentless self-indulgence taking the stage.</v>

3126
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.440
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3127
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:54.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3128
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 1>it piss people off.</v>

3129
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were upset at them.</v>

3130
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Talentless right?</v>

3131
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3132
01:23:58.571 --> 01:23:59.111
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>

3133
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 1>but no one's saying that it's a talent thing.</v>

3134
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:01.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3135

<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy balls.</v>

3136
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Really good at drowning myself.</v>

3137
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I was born with this bizarre talent where I can drown myself in anything.</v>

3138
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 1>This fucking won't do.</v>

3139
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Website doesn't work.</v>

3140
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3141
01:24:13.151 --> 01:24:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3142
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it was like on a weird site where I saw,</v>

3143
01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

3144
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that was when I still use the gap junction.</v>

3145
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Crazy idiot drowns himself for arc.</v>

3146
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

3147
01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:27.820
<v Speaker 1>That was the first one was like a critique of it and this one is a crazy idiot.</v>

3148
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Only sites are fucking wanky this way.</v>

3149
01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 1>It work in either cause it was streaming,</v>

3150
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3151
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:34.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3156
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's not what this is.</v>

3157
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3158
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 1>the sites are coming up instantly.</v>

3159
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:42.161
<v Speaker 1>It's not what it is.</v>

3160
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Internet just sucks my websites.</v>

3161
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if what your download speed,</v>

3162
01:24:48.191 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

3163
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.330
<v Speaker 1>your upload speeds product bottleneck neck.</v>

3164
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:52.173
<v Speaker 1>That something like,</v>

3165
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:52.781
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

3166
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question for you.</v>

3167
01:24:53.801 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

3168
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I've got an,</v>

3169
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I've got a tech technological question.</v>

3170
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Why does Korea have faster Internet than us?</v>

3171
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.433
<v Speaker 1>Most countries,</v>

3172
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:06.670
<v Speaker 1>most countries have faster internet to know why we're just behind,</v>

3173
01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3174
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 1>we're kicking ass and making freedom bro.</v>

3175
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.130
<v Speaker 1>That shit just gets left behind.</v>

3176
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Reason why there's cell phones,</v>

3177
01:25:13.451 --> 01:25:13.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3178
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.270
<v Speaker 1>are there video games ever?</v>

3179
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

3180
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Here's homeboy.</v>

3181
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:20.140
<v Speaker 1>If you just look up a drowning performance art,</v>

3182
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 1>go look at it up on Youtube.</v>

3183
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch it real quick and see if it's worth.</v>

3184
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:25.203
<v Speaker 1>How can you not say,</v>

3185
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 1>he talks about it.</v>

3187
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3188
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:28.331

3190
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:32.350
<v Speaker 1>because this guy is actually going to explain what the fuck is going to do</v>

3191
01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:33.184
<v Speaker 1>before</v>

3192
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:34.721
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

3193
01:25:34.721 --> 01:25:36.430
<v Speaker 1>how many views it has on Youtube?</v>

3194
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:37.090
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

3195
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 1>let's guess I say 35 times.</v>

3196
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what advertisements come you say I say 35,000 how many?</v>

3197
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to put that in 100,000 a hundred thousand let's say 27,000 shit,</v>

3198
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:50.100
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

3199
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You?</v>

3200
01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You overestimate the Justin Bieber fans of the world,</v>

3201
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:56.681
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

3202
01:25:56.681 --> 01:25:56.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3203
01:25:56.921 --> 01:25:57.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3204
01:25:57.131 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber's at least seeing a fucking song,</v>

3205
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:04.330
<v Speaker 1>bathtub and beaver is the soundtrack to a guy drowning himself in the bathtub.</v>

3206
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 1>It will quadruple the views.</v>

3207
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:06.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3208
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Justin Bieber sounds like.</v>

3209
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what a Justin Bieber signing angel is that in Brian when a</v>

3210
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 1>commercial for it?</v>

3211
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>No one has a commercial.</v>

3212
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:14.711
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>

3213
01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:15.381
<v Speaker 1>What commercial?</v>

3214
01:26:15.381 --> 01:26:15.630
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3215
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 1>What product are they selling with this guy's drowning video.</v>

3216
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Starcraft.</v>

3217
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.920
<v Speaker 1>It looks like no,</v>

3218
01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:21.410
<v Speaker 1>some kind of a video game.</v>

3219
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3220
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:23.623
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

3221
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:24.531
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3222
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Louis starcraft.</v>

3223
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.781
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

3224
01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>another podcast on a plane with Articia fear.</v>

3225
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3226
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:30.044
<v Speaker 1>how'd it go?</v>

3227
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.230
<v Speaker 1>We were blitzkrieg.</v>

3228
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.280
<v Speaker 1>We ate an edible before we got on the plane and we were,</v>

3229
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.911
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3230
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:36.230
<v Speaker 1>we were gone like scary.</v>

3231
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Gone.</v>

3232
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>

3233
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it was like my whole body was like tingling with vulnerability,</v>

3234
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3235
01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you get to that fits that state that you're still taking care of and a plane.</v>

3236
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the perfect place to do it.</v>

3237
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Like until you freak out and you can't get off the plane.</v>

3238
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Last time he was on a plane and did it,</v>

3239
01:26:51.531 --> 01:26:53.690
<v Speaker 1>he almost had to tell the stewardess that,</v>

3240
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:54.021
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3241
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I need to get out.</v>

3242
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit of exaggeration because he was on,</v>

3243
01:26:58.190 --> 01:26:59.240
<v Speaker 1>this is the time he was with me.</v>

3244
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:00.051
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3245
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3246
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.751
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3247
01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:01.460
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

3248
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.041
<v Speaker 1>oh mom,</v>

3249
01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I almost had to get off the plane.</v>

3250
01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:03.711
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3251
01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:04.320
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

3252
01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.061
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

3253
01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It was just a thought in his head,</v>

3254
01:27:06.381 --> 01:27:08.120
<v Speaker 1>but he never really actually did it.</v>

3255
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you press the stewardess button and ask if they would mind landing the</v>

3256
01:27:11.151 --> 01:27:11.791
<v Speaker 1>plane for him.</v>

3257
01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Landing and Phoenix really quick,</v>

3258
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Kinda to run,</v>

3259
01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:17.660
<v Speaker 1>run out into the desert and fun of myself</v>

3260
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.890
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

3261
01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:21.340
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

3262
01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:22.080
<v Speaker 1>he goes deep</v>

3263
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.910
<v Speaker 11>because I'd like to introduce myself and did she start off and Murphy Look,</v>

3264
01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.030
<v Speaker 11>performance artist,</v>

3265
01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:28.560
<v Speaker 11>I hate them already.</v>

3266
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.540
<v Speaker 11>My work is heavily influenced by Chris Burden's performance art from the 70s.</v>

3267
01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:34.981
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

3268
01:27:34.981 --> 01:27:39.720
<v Speaker 11>he's the artists most famous for his piece shoot in which he had his friend</v>

3269
01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:42.090
<v Speaker 11>shoot him in the arm with a 22 caliber rifle.</v>

3270
01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 11>That was a wonderful people you're about to see is a piece of mine entitled</v>

3271
01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:49.043
<v Speaker 11>drowning.</v>

3272
01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:55.020
<v Speaker 11>I feel that this piece requires a little bit of explanation.</v>

3273
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:55.983
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

3274
01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 11>When water enters the airway,</v>

3275
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:05.240
<v Speaker 11>the vocal cords constrict and seal off the air tube,</v>

3276
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 11>thus preventing any water from entering the lungs.</v>

3277
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.250
<v Speaker 11>This is called a leg,</v>

3278
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.084
<v Speaker 11>no spasm.</v>

3279
01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:14.740
<v Speaker 11>During this initial phase of drowning,</v>

3280
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:16.660
<v Speaker 11>very little water,</v>

3281
01:28:16.661 --> 01:28:19.000
<v Speaker 11>if any actually enters the lungs,</v>

3282
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:20.950
<v Speaker 11>it actually fills up the stomach.</v>

3283
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.203
<v Speaker 10>MMM.</v>

3284
01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:29.290
<v Speaker 11>My hands were bound and a concrete block was placed on my chest.</v>

3285
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.280
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

3286
01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.900
<v Speaker 11>this was done in order to weigh me down,</v>

3287
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:35.080
<v Speaker 11>but it also would help force air out of my lungs.</v>

3288
01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:36.820
<v Speaker 11>Or once I lost breath,</v>

3289
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.980
<v Speaker 11>you'll see that uh,</v>

3290
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:42.190
<v Speaker 11>nose clips were used as well in our to ensure safety</v>

3291
01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.630
<v Speaker 11>attracted to your fucking drowning yourself.</v>

3292
01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:50.820
<v Speaker 11>Wait for me to go unconscious and then immediately pull me out of the water that</v>

3293
01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:52.600
<v Speaker 11>in Cox it sounds so.</v>

3294
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:54.730
<v Speaker 11>I think that's pretty much it.</v>

3295
01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:57.010

3298
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how long you went under four.</v>

3321
01:29:59.751 --> 01:30:00.670
<v Speaker 3>won't be able to get out.</v>

3322

01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:34.901
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

3419
01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you keep forgetting?</v>

3420
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I got your notebook that you left here when you lived here.</v>

3421
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to read from that.</v>

3422
01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.130
<v Speaker 3>He Joe's already read through it.</v>

3423
01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I heard about the weight.</v>

3424
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:45.790
<v Speaker 3>You have to say about ponies.</v>

3425
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Thanks and love this thing.</v>

3426
01:33:48.531 --> 01:33:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It's been burning a hole through my check.</v>

3427
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:53.080
<v Speaker 3>You're just lucky that you didn't become famous.</v>

3428
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:58.110
<v Speaker 3>You lucky he didn't become famous in the time between a living here and going</v>

3429
01:33:58.571 --> 01:34:02.080
<v Speaker 3>out on your own because I would've sold that fucking thing if you were Charlie</v>

3430
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:02.081
<v Speaker 3>Sheen.</v>

3431
01:34:02.081 --> 01:34:03.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd be on the today show right now.</v>

3432
01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 3>I have the document that is a true friend to give this embarrassing journal</v>

3433
01:34:06.911 --> 01:34:07.241
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

3434
01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:07.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3435
01:34:07.331 --> 01:34:11.380
<v Speaker 3>this is the journal that Duncan Duncan got the boot from his missus back in the</v>

3436
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.070
<v Speaker 3>day and uh,</v>

3437
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 3>live with me for a few months.</v>

3438
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Best roommate ever by the way,</v>

3439
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 3>the only one that's ever cleaned.</v>

3440
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 3>I've got a couple of guys live with me.</v>

3441
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.880
<v Speaker 3>No one that ever like actually kept his room clean as Dunkin Tate live with me</v>

3442
01:34:21.881 --> 01:34:22.740
<v Speaker 3>for a few months and was like,</v>

3443
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:23.860
<v Speaker 3>goddamn tornado in there.</v>

3444
01:34:23.861 --> 01:34:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3445
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 3>it takes a fucking savage tape.</v>

3446
01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:26.231
<v Speaker 3>Might as well.</v>

3447
01:34:26.231 --> 01:34:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I just might as well just cut a hole in the,</v>

3448
01:34:28.021 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 3>in the side of the hill.</v>

3449
01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:32.680
<v Speaker 3>And Tate would've lived in there just to say game Tate's crazy.</v>

3450
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:33.693
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3451
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.121
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

3452
01:34:34.121 --> 01:34:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin wrote this,</v>

3453
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:37.720
<v Speaker 3>a journal about his feelings in the relationship and the reason why I brought</v>

3454
01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:38.021
<v Speaker 3>this up,</v>

3455
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 3>the reason why my mind even went to it in the first place is because a lot of</v>

3456
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:45.660
<v Speaker 3>people are scared or the isolation tank for the same reason they're scared to</v>

3457
01:34:45.661 --> 01:34:46.140
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

3458
01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:46.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3459
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Because it almost is like a personal death of you.</v>

3460
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:49.031
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3461
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 3>like a temporary death of you for a brief moment.</v>

3462
01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:52.050
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3463
01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 3>you cease to exist when you go into that,</v>

3464
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:54.694
<v Speaker 3>that tank,</v>

3465
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 3>that tank is also something that helps you.</v>

3466
01:34:57.801 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 3>And this is where the connection to this journal comes from.</v>

3467
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Juan,</v>

3468
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.580
<v Speaker 3>you were going through this breakup.</v>

3469
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You kind of reassessed your whole life.</v>

3470
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting to watch.</v>

3471
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.421
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3472
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:05.900
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3473
01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you came when you called me up and you were really bummed out and she kicked you</v>

3474
01:35:10.431 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 3>out and you were in a hotel room and I'm like,</v>

3475
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:12.871
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3476
01:35:12.871 --> 01:35:14.000
<v Speaker 3>you fucking come live with me.</v>

3477
01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:15.060
<v Speaker 3>And then you moved and you were like,</v>

3478
01:35:15.061 --> 01:35:16.300
<v Speaker 3>just a little frazzled.</v>

3479
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:16.641
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>

3480
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:17.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3481

<v Speaker 3>thanks a lot man.</v>

3482
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:18.411
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate it.</v>

3483
01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:18.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3484
01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:18.801
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3485
01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:19.551
<v Speaker 3>I'm living by myself.</v>

3486
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:20.121
<v Speaker 3>This is all good.</v>

3487
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:20.331
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3488
01:35:20.331 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin's live with me now.</v>

3489
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:22.004
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have some fun.</v>

3490
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.701
<v Speaker 3>It's been a pretty dude.</v>

3491
01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going to be fine.</v>

3492
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.720
<v Speaker 3>But you were clearly like lost,</v>

3493
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:27.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3494
01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:27.481

01:35:27.481 --> 01:35:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you would like gotten,</v>

3497
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3498
01:35:28.601 --> 01:35:30.050
<v Speaker 3>when you get dumped man,</v>

3499
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 3>it's like just fucking feeling of shit.</v>

3500
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a home anymore.</v>

3501
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3502
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Like where am I sleeping?</v>

3503
01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3504
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.921
<v Speaker 6>Massive.</v>

3505
01:35:36.921 --> 01:35:39.950
<v Speaker 6>Like just towards your junction change complete.</v>

3506
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 6>You've been living this certain way along enough to,</v>

3507
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.850
<v Speaker 6>to get used to it and then all of a sudden everything absolutely changes.</v>

3508
01:35:46.851 --> 01:35:51.851
<v Speaker 6>Like just a huge tour turn that you probably thought could happen,</v>

3509
01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 6>but you're,</v>

3510
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:53.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3511
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.210
<v Speaker 6>trying to imagine that it wasn't even a possibility.</v>

3512
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 6>And it happens.</v>

3513
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.861
<v Speaker 6>Well that,</v>

3514
01:35:57.861 --> 01:35:58.221
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3515
01:35:58.221 --> 01:35:58.880
<v Speaker 6>that's like,</v>

3516
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.050
<v Speaker 6>you go into shock,</v>

3517
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 6>you're attached to a certain rhythm,</v>

3518
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:04.130
<v Speaker 6>a certain pattern,</v>

3519
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.800
<v Speaker 6>a certain set of surroundings that massively changes you.</v>

3520
01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:11.750
<v Speaker 6>You go into shock and that is the perfect time to get in a fucking flotation</v>

3521
01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:15.190
<v Speaker 6>tank when everything's discombobulated and floating around inside of you and all</v>

3522
01:36:15.191 --> 01:36:15.640
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3523
01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.380
<v Speaker 6>all the,</v>

3524
01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:16.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3525
01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.890
<v Speaker 6>weird assemblage of emotions.</v>

3526
01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:20.720
<v Speaker 6>And more than anything though,</v>

3527
01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:23.480
<v Speaker 6>what's cool about that shit is you get a real taste of truth.</v>

3528
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.700
<v Speaker 6>Like that's what truth is right there.</v>

3529
01:36:25.701 --> 01:36:27.980
<v Speaker 6>That's like the experience of truth,</v>

3530
01:36:27.981 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 6>which is change,</v>

3531
01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:30.560
<v Speaker 6>which is dramatic,</v>

3532
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.630
<v Speaker 6>radical change.</v>

3533
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 6>Fucking unavoidable happens all the time.</v>

3534
01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:35.331
<v Speaker 3>Did the,</v>

3535
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:39.520
<v Speaker 3>the isolation tank keeps you from distracting yourself and makes you think about</v>

3536
01:36:39.521 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 3>your life?</v>

3537
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3538
01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:41.830
<v Speaker 3>It makes you think about what's going on.</v>

3539
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.390
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

3540
01:36:43.391 --> 01:36:48.391
<v Speaker 3>it was so fascinating having you here at a real low point and watching you pull</v>

3541
01:36:49.361 --> 01:36:51.340
<v Speaker 3>right out of it right out of it,</v>

3542
01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>like very quickly.</v>

3543
01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:53.381
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

3544
01:36:53.381 --> 01:36:55.450
<v Speaker 3>when you got into that tank and within a few weeks,</v>

3545
01:36:55.451 --> 01:36:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>

3546
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:58.300
<v Speaker 3>you were laughing about shit and joking around about it.</v>

3547
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.590
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3548
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:59.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3549
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.731
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3550
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:00.510
<v Speaker 6>They always cool.</v>

3551
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:01.000
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

3552
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:01.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3553
01:37:01.411 --> 01:37:02.670
<v Speaker 6>it definitely,</v>

3554
01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.900
<v Speaker 6>definitely helps.</v>

3555
01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:05.220
<v Speaker 6>And that's why you're this,</v>

3556
01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 6>my friends are so important.</v>

3557
01:37:06.591 --> 01:37:11.591
<v Speaker 6>Cause like if you don't have friends and you get into that predicament oh</v>

3558
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.311
<v Speaker 6>terrible.</v>

3559
01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:16.560
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst feeling it feel completely alone.</v>

3560
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:17.101
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3561
01:37:17.101 --> 01:37:17.521
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3562
01:37:17.521 --> 01:37:17.790
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3563
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:18.930
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

3564
01:37:18.931 --> 01:37:19.980
<v Speaker 6>even if you don't have friends,</v>

3565
01:37:19.981 --> 01:37:21.960
<v Speaker 6>you can still pull yourself out of it,</v>

3566
01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 6>but you have to I guess really want,</v>

3567
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.091
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3568
01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:25.370
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3569
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:26.580
<v Speaker 6>you have to want to,</v>

3570
01:37:26.850 --> 01:37:27.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3571
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3572
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.801
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

3573
01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:29.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3574
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3575
01:37:29.551 --> 01:37:29.761
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3576
01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:33.000
<v Speaker 3>anyone can can improve their surroundings so you can improve your situation.</v>

3577
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:37.470
<v Speaker 3>But it was really interesting for me watching you because it was such an unusual</v>

3578
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.720
<v Speaker 3>opportunity for both of us.</v>

3579
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:42.990
<v Speaker 3>It was an unusual opportunity for me to watch someone who didn't have a lot of</v>

3580
01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:44.100
<v Speaker 3>experience with a tank,</v>

3581
01:37:44.130 --> 01:37:49.130
<v Speaker 3>but who was such a curious person and psychedelically experienced like you and</v>

3582
01:37:49.171 --> 01:37:50.820
<v Speaker 3>then have access to this thing on a,</v>

3583
01:37:50.821 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis,</v>

3584
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.681
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3585
01:37:52.681 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>And for me to watch you go from this really low</v>

3586
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 9>point to like,</v>

3587
01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 9>like really like gaining ground.</v>

3588
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.290
<v Speaker 9>Like you came out of it like stronger</v>

3589
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:04.650
<v Speaker 6>fucking cool climbing out of that thing.</v>

3590
01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.110
<v Speaker 6>In that state of being in the,</v>

3591
01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 6>in the state of like having had,</v>

3592
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.470
<v Speaker 6>because you know,</v>

3593
01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 6>their second psychedelics are not limited to drugs.</v>

3594
01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:14.540
<v Speaker 6>There,</v>

3595
01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:17.610
<v Speaker 6>there's many ways to induce a psychedelic state of mind.</v>

3596
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:19.110
<v Speaker 6>The tank being one of them.</v>

3597
01:38:19.111 --> 01:38:20.580
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3598
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 6>another way to induce a psychedelic state of mind is to have dramatic change</v>

3599
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:30.051
<v Speaker 6>happen in your life that rips back whatever delusion you are living by and shows</v>

3600
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:31.510
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

3601
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:32.770
<v Speaker 9>the true universe.</v>

3602
01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.130
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3603
01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:37.270
<v Speaker 9>People turn the term psychedelic to a lot of people means like seeing things</v>

3604
01:38:37.271 --> 01:38:39.100
<v Speaker 9>that aren't their hallucinations,</v>

3605
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.210
<v Speaker 9>dancing mice,</v>

3606
01:38:40.211 --> 01:38:40.421
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3607
01:38:40.421 --> 01:38:41.081
<v Speaker 9>Shit like that.</v>

3608
01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:42.700
<v Speaker 9>Pink elephants flying in the sky.</v>

3609
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.980
<v Speaker 9>That's not a real psychedelic state.</v>

3610
01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:50.130
<v Speaker 9>The real psychedelic state is the dissolution of cultural conformity and the Ah,</v>

3611
01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:52.150
<v Speaker 9>your ideas of the universe,</v>

3612
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:55.270
<v Speaker 9>all your predetermined patterns of thinking all your,</v>

3613
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:57.310
<v Speaker 9>you're adopted behavior patterns,</v>

3614
01:38:57.311 --> 01:39:00.970
<v Speaker 9>all that gets stripped away and you're left with the core of you and your</v>

3615
01:39:00.971 --> 01:39:01.870
<v Speaker 9>decisions and,</v>

3616
01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:02.711
<v Speaker 9>and what,</v>

3617
01:39:02.711 --> 01:39:04.270
<v Speaker 9>what you can and can't change.</v>

3618
01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:07.990
<v Speaker 9>And how you led yourself into a position where you were so weak in the first</v>

3619
01:39:07.991 --> 01:39:08.561
<v Speaker 9>place that you,</v>

3620
01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:08.710
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3621
01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:10.390
<v Speaker 9>you needed saving from.</v>

3622
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 9>Like what?</v>

3623
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:11.891
<v Speaker 9>What were,</v>

3624
01:39:11.891 --> 01:39:13.480
<v Speaker 9>why did you have no foundation?</v>

3625
01:39:13.481 --> 01:39:14.311
<v Speaker 9>Why did you fall apart?</v>

3626
01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:14.890
<v Speaker 9>Like when,</v>

3627
01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:15.910
<v Speaker 9>what is it about,</v>

3628
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.270
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3629
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:19.660
<v Speaker 9>life and about trying to get by in this world that leaves us so fucking</v>

3630
01:39:19.661 --> 01:39:24.520
<v Speaker 9>vulnerable sometimes and so in need of other human beings is to stack us up and</v>

3631
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.720
<v Speaker 9>to hold us up and watching you man was really fucking cool.</v>

3632
01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.430
<v Speaker 9>It was really cool because you really used it,</v>

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:36.661
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

3685
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:38.030

3691
01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.030

01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.630
<v Speaker 9>you're not the right word,</v>

3705
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 9>but it's not resigned that that's cause that sounds like you're giving up.</v>

3706
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.071
<v Speaker 9>It's not,</v>

3707
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:03.760
<v Speaker 9>that's not what I mean.</v>

3708
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.031
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>

3709
01:41:04.031 --> 01:41:06.370
<v Speaker 9>you are completely aware of who you are.</v>

3710
01:41:06.371 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 9>That's the best way of saying it.</v>

3711
01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 9>When you're going on stage now you're going on stage,</v>

3712
01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 9>not trying to convince them of anything.</v>

3713
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:13.480
<v Speaker 9>You're just,</v>

3714
01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.150
<v Speaker 9>this is me and this is what I'm doing is what I have to say.</v>

3715
01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 9>Whereas before you were like,</v>

3716
01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:18.101
<v Speaker 9>Hey,</v>

3717
01:41:18.101 --> 01:41:19.210
<v Speaker 9>I hope you like me.</v>

3718
01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.470
<v Speaker 9>Do you like me?</v>

3719
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:21.131
<v Speaker 9>You don't like me.</v>

3720
01:41:21.131 --> 01:41:22.360
<v Speaker 9>Well here I'm gonna say something,</v>

3721
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:23.030
<v Speaker 9>I guess.</v>

3722
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:24.290
<v Speaker 9>I guess that weirded me out.</v>

3723
01:41:24.291 --> 01:41:24.540
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

3724
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:29.010
<v Speaker 6>I think the reason the word resigned popped out of your mouth first is because I</v>

3725
01:41:29.011 --> 01:41:31.620
<v Speaker 6>think there is a certain level of being,</v>

3726
01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:33.900
<v Speaker 6>and it sounds like it's like I'm giving up,</v>

3727
01:41:33.901 --> 01:41:38.040
<v Speaker 6>but resigned can also be like a kind of surrender where you're like,</v>

3728
01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm just no longer going to spend time,</v>

3729
01:41:41.851 --> 01:41:45.300
<v Speaker 6>whether on stage or off stage.</v>

3730
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to spend time anymore.</v>

3731
01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:50.910
<v Speaker 6>Trying to convince myself or other people that I'm some certain way and I'm</v>

3732
01:41:50.911 --> 01:41:54.150
<v Speaker 6>going to start trying to approach people from where I'm at.</v>

3733
01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3734
01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.350
<v Speaker 6>Which is,</v>

3735
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:59.040
<v Speaker 6>which is not a perfect place for most people.</v>

3736
01:41:59.041 --> 01:42:00.450
<v Speaker 6>Most most of us are,</v>

3737
01:42:01.050 --> 01:42:01.883
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3738
01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:03.990
<v Speaker 6>have fucked up things that we do.</v>

3739
01:42:03.991 --> 01:42:04.980
<v Speaker 6>And why wouldn't you?</v>

3740
01:42:04.981 --> 01:42:05.221
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3741
01:42:05.221 --> 01:42:07.080
<v Speaker 6>you're going to look at where you're at.</v>

3742
01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:08.071
<v Speaker 6>Like you say,</v>

3743
01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:10.710
<v Speaker 6>we're in a fucking ball flying through fucking space.</v>

3744
01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:15.030
<v Speaker 6>How are you supposed to adapt to this in some brilliant way,</v>

3745
01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.500
<v Speaker 6>right off the bat,</v>

3746
01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.610
<v Speaker 6>you know you can,</v>

3747
01:42:17.611 --> 01:42:18.240
<v Speaker 6>it's a champ.</v>

3748
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.470
<v Speaker 6>You're in this insane dimension where were getting rocketed through space where</v>

3749
01:42:22.471 --> 01:42:23.490
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna die.</v>

3750
01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.720
<v Speaker 6>You're surrounded by people who call themselves your family that you're supposed</v>

3751
01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:29.070
<v Speaker 6>to have attachments to.</v>

3752
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.450
<v Speaker 6>They're going to die.</v>

3753
01:42:30.451 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 6>You're in a life where you've just adopted certain modes of being.</v>

3754
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:35.610
<v Speaker 6>I didn't have a baby,</v>

3755
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:36.870
<v Speaker 6>I didn't get married,</v>

3756
01:42:37.170 --> 01:42:41.340
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of people do when they weren't ready and they weren't supposed to and</v>

3757
01:42:41.341 --> 01:42:42.060
<v Speaker 6>they get married,</v>

3758
01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:46.440
<v Speaker 6>they have a baby and they are theoretically for this incarnation,</v>

3759
01:42:46.590 --> 01:42:48.610
<v Speaker 6>pretty fucking trapped there in</v>

3760
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.510
<v Speaker 9>a lot of people are.</v>

3761
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:50.440
<v Speaker 9>A lot of people haven't yet.</v>

3762
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 9>They have all kinds of weird situations where the relationship,</v>

3763
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:55.120
<v Speaker 9>they're stuck somehow or another,</v>

3764
01:42:55.121 --> 01:42:58.180
<v Speaker 9>whether it's because of a mortgage or because of a business that they started</v>

3765
01:42:58.181 --> 01:42:58.840
<v Speaker 9>together</v>

3766
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.540
<v Speaker 6>me a mental idea of how things are supposed to deal with some person or you give</v>

3767
01:43:02.541 --> 01:43:07.541
<v Speaker 6>birth to a child that has like a a melted brain and you've got to take care of</v>

3768
01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:13.181
<v Speaker 6>like a little like sick kid for 12 years or like there's so many different ways</v>

3769
01:43:14.031 --> 01:43:19.031
<v Speaker 6>that your particular DNA can get regulated down into a shitty trap where you're</v>

3770
01:43:20.811 --> 01:43:21.970
<v Speaker 6>just like there.</v>

3771
01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:22.761
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>

3772
01:43:22.761 --> 01:43:23.870
<v Speaker 6>that's why I liked that movie.</v>

3773
01:43:23.871 --> 01:43:26.840
<v Speaker 6>You said you didn't want to see it and I'm sorry if you've seen it in like it,</v>

3774
01:43:26.841 --> 01:43:28.880
<v Speaker 6>but what was that hundred and 27 hours?</v>

3775
01:43:28.881 --> 01:43:29.610
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that?</v>

3776
01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:29.881
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3777
01:43:29.881 --> 01:43:32.220
<v Speaker 9>I didn't see it because I knew the story and I,</v>

3778
01:43:32.221 --> 01:43:32.960
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3779
01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:33.793
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to watch it.</v>

3780
01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.570
<v Speaker 6>It's a torture movie.</v>

3781
01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:36.770
<v Speaker 6>There's no reason to watch it.</v>

3782
01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.140
<v Speaker 6>Everybody says that it's a torture movie.</v>

3783
01:43:39.141 --> 01:43:41.540
<v Speaker 6>Like it was fixated on the Gore or the,</v>

3784
01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:42.381
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't,</v>

3785
01:43:42.381 --> 01:43:43.340
<v Speaker 6>it's a fucking metaphor,</v>

3786
01:43:43.341 --> 01:43:44.174
<v Speaker 6>which is that,</v>

3787
01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:44.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3788
01:43:44.690 --> 01:43:49.390
<v Speaker 6>some times doing the thing you love to do whatever it is and,</v>

3789
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 6>and that's for a lot of people's doing the thing you love most,</v>

3790
01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.430
<v Speaker 6>you can end up getting your goddamn arm pen.</v>

3791
01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3792
01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:57.990
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>

3793
01:43:57.990 --> 01:44:00.840
<v Speaker 9>you're connecting someone having a baby to cutting your arm off.</v>

3794
01:44:00.841 --> 01:44:01.290
<v Speaker 9>That's funny.</v>

3795
01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:01.711
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3796
01:44:01.711 --> 01:44:02.544
<v Speaker 6>I'm kidding.</v>

3797
01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:03.120
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3798
01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm not connecting if you have a baby for the right reason.</v>

3799
01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:05.891
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3800
01:44:05.891 --> 01:44:07.180
<v Speaker 9>I know what you're saying for the wrong reasons.</v>

3801
01:44:07.210 --> 01:44:07.481
<v Speaker 9>I know,</v>

3802
01:44:07.481 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 9>I know what you're saying.</v>

3803
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:08.650
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3804
01:44:08.650 --> 01:44:11.950
<v Speaker 9>You were saying what a lot of single people with no children say and what you're</v>

3805
01:44:11.951 --> 01:44:12.641
<v Speaker 9>saying is,</v>

3806
01:44:12.641 --> 01:44:12.971
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3807
01:44:12.971 --> 01:44:16.150
<v Speaker 9>we were talking about our friend who tweeted something about having a child is</v>

3808
01:44:16.151 --> 01:44:18.280
<v Speaker 9>like the exact opposite of winning the lottery.</v>

3809
01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.060
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3810
01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.400
<v Speaker 9>I used to think the exact same way until I had children.</v>

3811
01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.880
<v Speaker 9>But my situation is very different in that,</v>

3812
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:25.391
<v Speaker 9>first of all,</v>

3813
01:44:25.391 --> 01:44:26.590
<v Speaker 9>I'm older,</v>

3814
01:44:26.591 --> 01:44:28.980
<v Speaker 9>I've had more experience in life and um,</v>

3815
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:32.830
<v Speaker 9>I'm secure financially and happy in the relationship.</v>

3816
01:44:32.831 --> 01:44:35.230
<v Speaker 9>So it was all good things at a good time.</v>

3817
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:37.930
<v Speaker 9>But when I look back on past relationships,</v>

3818
01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:38.580
<v Speaker 9>some of them,</v>

3819
01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:40.600
<v Speaker 9>there was a bunch of relationships that I've been in,</v>

3820
01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:41.260
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3821
01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.490
<v Speaker 9>like way back in the day when I was younger and I really didn't know what the</v>

3822
01:44:45.491 --> 01:44:48.040
<v Speaker 9>fuck I was doing and I was hanging around with chicks that I probably really</v>

3823
01:44:48.041 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 9>didn't even like that much,</v>

3824
01:44:49.151 --> 01:44:50.680
<v Speaker 9>but I was still having sex with them.</v>

3825
01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.520
<v Speaker 9>And sometimes you'd have like a crazy fucking breakup are crazy bad</v>

3826
01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:55.030
<v Speaker 9>relationship.</v>

3827
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:58.690
<v Speaker 9>That person could be out there with your kid and then you have to deal with all</v>

3828
01:44:58.691 --> 01:45:01.000
<v Speaker 9>kinds of nonsense that comes with that.</v>

3829
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:01.301
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

3830
01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:03.000
<v Speaker 9>we all know somebody that has kids,</v>

3831
01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:03.843
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3832
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.190
<v Speaker 9>shit situation.</v>

3833
01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:06.010
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3834
01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:06.480
<v Speaker 9>So I,</v>

3835
01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.750
<v Speaker 9>I hear what you're saying man,</v>

3836
01:45:07.930 --> 01:45:08.810
<v Speaker 6>what did but that,</v>

3837
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:09.644
<v Speaker 6>so what,</v>

3838
01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:09.951
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3839
01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:12.230
<v Speaker 6>what I'm really saying is like the,</v>

3840
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 6>the idea and it goes back to what we're being comfortable resigned to who you</v>

3841
01:45:16.371 --> 01:45:17.204
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

3842
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.490
<v Speaker 6>That's where I didn't like the way I said resign though.</v>

3843
01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:20.324
<v Speaker 6>I didn't mean reside.</v>

3844
01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:21.530
<v Speaker 6>I sometimes,</v>

3845
01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.180
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you have to be resigned,</v>

3846
01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.931
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3847
01:45:23.931 --> 01:45:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Not all of us are fucking Charlie Sheen,</v>

3848
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:28.280
<v Speaker 6>not all stars from Mars.</v>

3849
01:45:28.281 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 6>Not all of us are a freaking rock star from Mars.</v>

3850
01:45:30.531 --> 01:45:30.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3851
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.060
<v Speaker 6>Some of us are like,</v>

3852
01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3853
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:36.040
<v Speaker 6>we all don't to pretend that I'm not special or fucked up and a lot of ways man,</v>

3854
01:45:36.041 --> 01:45:36.191
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3855
01:45:36.191 --> 01:45:36.890
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>

3856
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:37.671
<v Speaker 6>if you start from,</v>

3857
01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:38.504
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3858
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:39.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3859
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:41.840
<v Speaker 6>one thing that I would try to do when I used to work out,</v>

3860
01:45:41.841 --> 01:45:42.740
<v Speaker 6>and it's like when I,</v>

3861
01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

3862
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 6>when I first started working out,</v>

3863
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:49.820
<v Speaker 6>how would try to lift weight that was so much more heavy than what I should have</v>

3864
01:45:49.821 --> 01:45:53.930
<v Speaker 6>been lifting out of this sense of like I could lift heavy weights.</v>

3865
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:56.920
<v Speaker 6>And so now I'm like trying to live like way too.</v>

3866
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:57.670
<v Speaker 6>Why am I like,</v>

3867
01:45:57.670 --> 01:45:59.510
<v Speaker 6>why should be at the fucking pink weights?</v>

3868
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:01.300
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like trying to do a quick,</v>

3869
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:01.911
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3870
01:46:01.911 --> 01:46:05.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to do like really fucking heavy weights cause it's like this is how I</v>

3871
01:46:05.301 --> 01:46:09.610
<v Speaker 6>see myself down the line after I've been lifting pink waits for a while.</v>

3872
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 6>That's how you get to the heavyweights,</v>

3873
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3874
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:15.380
<v Speaker 6>But if you start off right away trying to pump those fucking heavyweights,</v>

3875
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:16.880
<v Speaker 6>then it's disaster.</v>

3876
01:46:16.881 --> 01:46:20.100
<v Speaker 6>You're going to pull your fucking muscles like people how,</v>

3877
01:46:20.130 --> 01:46:20.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3878
01:46:20.610 --> 01:46:22.220
<v Speaker 6>like due to lifting weights.</v>

3879
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:23.300
<v Speaker 6>One Guy I think came up to me,</v>

3880
01:46:23.301 --> 01:46:26.360
<v Speaker 6>he's like looking at me like what are you doing?</v>

3881
01:46:26.361 --> 01:46:26.661
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

3882
01:46:26.661 --> 01:46:29.510
<v Speaker 6>that's way too much weight.</v>

3883
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.620
<v Speaker 6>And so this is like having a kid when you're 16 having a kid when you were 16 or</v>

3884
01:46:33.621 --> 01:46:36.230
<v Speaker 6>deciding that you're a famous comedian before you,</v>

3885
01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:40.520
<v Speaker 6>are you getting on stage after a couple of months and getting in your fucking</v>

3886
01:46:40.521 --> 01:46:41.390
<v Speaker 6>head that you're like,</v>

3887
01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:46.280
<v Speaker 6>you've been doing standup for 15 years or being a fucking painter when and like</v>

3888
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 6>just immediately thinking you're a great painter because I've had friends who've</v>

3889
01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 6>into painting,</v>

3890
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.550
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3891
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 6>And they've only painted for a year and they show me some of their paintings and</v>

3892
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 6>the look on their face is like,</v>

3893
01:46:55.230 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm supposed to react to it.</v>

3894
01:46:56.491 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm seeing a Picasso or something.</v>

3895
01:46:58.381 --> 01:46:58.910
<v Speaker 6>It's like</v>

3896
01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:03.080
<v Speaker 9>I hate almost everyone that shows me things that I'm supposed to look at that</v>

3897
01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:06.050
<v Speaker 9>they did almost every time someone does that to me and Mike,</v>

3898
01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:07.610
<v Speaker 9>are you really going to do this to me?</v>

3899
01:47:07.611 --> 01:47:07.890
<v Speaker 9>Mom,</v>

3900
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:12.530
<v Speaker 9>please don't make me read your fucking script.</v>

3901
01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.510
<v Speaker 9>Don't ask me to read your script.</v>

3902
01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:16.130
<v Speaker 9>You Fuck Hey Daddy,</v>

3903
01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.090
<v Speaker 9>you read my script row.</v>

3904
01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:18.073
<v Speaker 9>It's the worst.</v>

3905
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:22.100
<v Speaker 9>The worst is when it's bad and then you're obligated to talk to them and go,</v>

3906
01:47:22.101 --> 01:47:22.330
<v Speaker 9>all right,</v>

3907
01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:23.330
<v Speaker 9>here's the situation.</v>

3908
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:23.931
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

3909
01:47:23.931 --> 01:47:28.931
<v Speaker 9>you basically did men and black meets back to the future written by a 12 year</v>

3910
01:47:29.091 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 9>old.</v>

3911
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:30.130
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

3912
01:47:30.130 --> 01:47:30.963
<v Speaker 9>like it's like</v>

3913
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:33.800
<v Speaker 9>you can't even say that.</v>

3914
01:47:33.801 --> 01:47:34.150
<v Speaker 9>You have to go,</v>

3915
01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:34.610
<v Speaker 9>wow,</v>

3916
01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:35.151
<v Speaker 9>it's pretty good,</v>

3917
01:47:35.151 --> 01:47:35.630
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

3918
01:47:35.630 --> 01:47:36.463
<v Speaker 9>It's pretty good.</v>

3919
01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:36.680
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3920
01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.020
<v Speaker 6>now see that's the thing.</v>

3921
01:47:38.170 --> 01:47:39.190
<v Speaker 6>That's where you get,</v>

3922
01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.600
<v Speaker 6>and I think kind of what we're talking about,</v>

3923
01:47:40.601 --> 01:47:43.840
<v Speaker 6>which is like at some point you have to make a decision.</v>

3924
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:49.030
<v Speaker 6>Am I going to spend the rest of my life lying to the world?</v>

3925
01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:53.020
<v Speaker 6>Am I going to spend the rest of my life meant trying to manipulate people around</v>

3926
01:47:53.021 --> 01:47:57.240
<v Speaker 6>me because I'm too lazy to tell them the truth or am I just going to start</v>

3927
01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.310
<v Speaker 9>telling the truth?</v>

3928
01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:59.131
<v Speaker 9>Well what if it though,</v>

3929
01:47:59.131 --> 01:48:01.290
<v Speaker 9>if it's a friend that's written something really cool though.</v>

3930
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:02.800
<v Speaker 9>What if someone who's got a script and I mean,</v>

3931
01:48:02.801 --> 01:48:05.550
<v Speaker 9>so that's the problem with all the shitheads that want you to read their scripts</v>

3932
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.910
<v Speaker 9>and makes you super skeptical for the occasional rare person and actually write</v>

3933
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:09.570
<v Speaker 9>something good.</v>

3934
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

3935
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.441
<v Speaker 9>And it's just like,</v>

3936
01:48:10.441 --> 01:48:10.561
<v Speaker 9>Hey,</v>

3937
01:48:10.561 --> 01:48:11.470
<v Speaker 9>I think this is pretty good.</v>

3938
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:12.323
<v Speaker 9>You want to read it?</v>

3939
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:13.090
<v Speaker 9>And then you're like,</v>

3940
01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:13.411
<v Speaker 9>all right,</v>

3941
01:48:13.411 --> 01:48:13.920
<v Speaker 9>I'll read it.</v>

3942
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.431
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

3943
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:14.820
<v Speaker 9>How many,</v>

3944
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 9>how many of those are there?</v>

3945
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.950
<v Speaker 6>People I know who are really good at things,</v>

3946
01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:19.630
<v Speaker 6>they don't ask me to look at it.</v>

3947
01:48:19.690 --> 01:48:22.030
<v Speaker 6>I ended up looking at it cause I want to,</v>

3948
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:22.480
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3949
01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.560
<v Speaker 6>like my friend email,</v>

3950
01:48:23.561 --> 01:48:25.990
<v Speaker 6>he just visited like his music's fucking good.</v>

3951
01:48:26.170 --> 01:48:29.980
<v Speaker 6>So like I try to get new cds of his cause I want to listen to it cause it's</v>

3952
01:48:29.981 --> 01:48:31.210
<v Speaker 6>really fucking good.</v>

3953
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3954
01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:35.740
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes somebody else sends you something or somebody be in their car if</v>

3955
01:48:35.741 --> 01:48:37.550
<v Speaker 6>they're a musician and then they'll put their shit off.</v>

3956
01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:38.590
<v Speaker 6>You have to listen to it</v>

3957
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:41.590
<v Speaker 6>or do that.</v>

3958
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:43.930
<v Speaker 6>That is ever let a musician drive.</v>

3959
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:49.640
<v Speaker 6>I never let them get in your car with a CD in your hand to your fucking hand</v>

3960
01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.170
<v Speaker 6>cause you're suddenly,</v>

3961
01:48:53.171 --> 01:48:57.820
<v Speaker 6>you're forced suddenly not just to evaluate how miserable and artists they are,</v>

3962
01:48:57.850 --> 01:48:59.890
<v Speaker 6>how cliche and shitty their music is.</v>

3963
01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.730
<v Speaker 6>But also you have to re you realize that the fact that they felt comfortable</v>

3964
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:06.430
<v Speaker 6>playing this for you means they think it's good.</v>

3965
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:06.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3966
01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:07.400
<v Speaker 6>These are they,</v>

3967
01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:09.260
<v Speaker 6>they're so diluted and so fucked up.</v>

3968
01:49:09.261 --> 01:49:09.581
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

3969
01:49:09.581 --> 01:49:10.270
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3970
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.870
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to I,</v>

3971
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:13.230
<v Speaker 6>they've been waiting all day to play their music because they</v>

3972
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:16.600
<v Speaker 9>to a script or a piece of music or a joke or,</v>

3973
01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.690
<v Speaker 9>I mean how many times have you had a friend who's just starting out and they</v>

3974
01:49:19.691 --> 01:49:20.560
<v Speaker 9>have a bit and you've got,</v>

3975
01:49:20.561 --> 01:49:21.161
<v Speaker 9>you want to tell them.</v>

3976
01:49:21.161 --> 01:49:22.750
<v Speaker 9>I came in and you need to drop that bit.</v>

3977
01:49:22.751 --> 01:49:23.031
<v Speaker 9>That bit.</v>

3978
01:49:23.031 --> 01:49:23.201
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3979
01:49:23.201 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 9>Good.</v>

3980
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:24.131

01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:29.201
<v Speaker 9>I'm been doing it.</v>

3991
01:49:29.201 --> 01:49:30.580
<v Speaker 9>It's been killing you.</v>

3992
01:49:30.581 --> 01:49:33.460
<v Speaker 9>You're fundamentally looking at the whole premise and what he's saying and</v>

3993
01:49:33.461 --> 01:49:33.700
<v Speaker 9>you're like,</v>

3994

<v Speaker 9>this is a shit joke dude.</v>

3995
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:35.640
<v Speaker 6>Terrible.</v>

3996
01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3997
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.110
<v Speaker 6>Someone clunker.</v>

3998
01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:38.290
<v Speaker 6>If someone's just been doing,</v>

3999
01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.330
<v Speaker 6>if someone's been doing standup for less than a year,</v>

4000
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:43.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't even critique their material cause I know they're going to grow out of</v>

4001
01:49:43.601 --> 01:49:45.580
<v Speaker 6>it and it's going to change and it's going to get,</v>

4002
01:49:45.581 --> 01:49:46.414
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4003
01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.290
<v Speaker 6>well there's the first year of stand</v>

4004
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:49.030
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

4005
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 7>You can't do any.</v>

4006
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 7>You're lucky if you're,</v>

4007
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.710
<v Speaker 7>if you're really,</v>

4008
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:55.340
<v Speaker 7>well isn't that like a any bay,</v>

4009
01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Speaker 7>it's only takes a couple of things to add to something and that's the whole</v>

4010
01:49:58.751 --> 01:49:59.081
<v Speaker 7>point.</v>

4011
01:49:59.081 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 7>It no bit starts off like a grade,</v>

4012
01:50:00.911 --> 01:50:01.960
<v Speaker 7>a bit from the beginning.</v>

4013
01:50:01.961 --> 01:50:05.140
<v Speaker 7>Usually it's usually you have some kind of idea and you tried to go through it</v>

4014
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:07.630
<v Speaker 7>and then like add to it and make it an actual bit.</v>

4015
01:50:07.631 --> 01:50:08.464
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4016
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 7>So that's what's weird about me.</v>

4017
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 7>Cause like I'll go on stage and people come up to me and go to that bit sucks or</v>

4018
01:50:12.611 --> 01:50:13.061
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>

4019
01:50:13.061 --> 01:50:13.480
<v Speaker 7>But I'm like,</v>

4020
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:13.751
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4021
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 7>but this is like the second time I've ever said it,</v>

4022
01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:16.541
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

4023
01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

4024
01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 7>the thing is it's like there's no fucking rules about about it or anything.</v>

4025
01:50:21.101 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 7>It just takes a long time.</v>

4026
01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:22.760
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4027
01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.593
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

4028

<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

4076
01:51:17.571 --> 01:51:18.231
<v Speaker 7>there was an idea.</v>

4077
01:51:18.231 --> 01:51:18.840
<v Speaker 7>There's an idea,</v>

4078
01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.060
<v Speaker 7>there's trying to make bits,</v>

4079
01:51:20.061 --> 01:51:21.440
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't write any of this shit out,</v>

4080
01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:22.101
<v Speaker 7>so I want to stage,</v>

4081
01:51:22.101 --> 01:51:22.710

<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

4086
01:51:24.401 --> 01:51:27.650
<v Speaker 7>it's funny like writing into me or at least thinking of,</v>

4087
01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.980
<v Speaker 7>you can go on stage balls out like that with nothing in your head.</v>

4088
01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:32.300
<v Speaker 7>You have to have some materials.</v>

4089
01:51:32.301 --> 01:51:32.810
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4090
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:34.190
<v Speaker 7>Well usually I like this kind of,</v>

4091
01:51:34.191 --> 01:51:34.231
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

4092

4094
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 9>Like I'll go on stage sometimes and I'll fuck around and I don't know what I'm</v>

4095
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:40.500
<v Speaker 9>gonna say.</v>

4096
01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.640
<v Speaker 9>Like I came up with that bit about the birds.</v>

4097
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:43.211
<v Speaker 9>Again,</v>

4098
01:51:43.211 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 9>there's birds are falling from the sky,</v>

4099
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:45.581
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4100
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:46.331
<v Speaker 9>and everyone's like,</v>

4101
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:46.601
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

4102
01:51:46.601 --> 01:51:47.910
<v Speaker 9>it's a fucking apocalypse man.</v>

4103
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.080
<v Speaker 9>Look,</v>

4104
01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:48.830
<v Speaker 9>the burns,</v>

4105
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:49.270
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

4106
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 9>one thing that you don't consider is that birds are cunts.</v>

4107
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 9>Okay?</v>

4108
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:53.380
<v Speaker 9>First of all,</v>

4109
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.510
<v Speaker 9>who cares about birds falling from the fucking sky?</v>

4110
01:51:55.511 --> 01:51:56.620
<v Speaker 9>Birds don't give a shit about you.</v>

4111
01:51:56.770 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 9>They're surviving dinosaurs.</v>

4112
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:59.320
<v Speaker 9>And second of all,</v>

4113
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.790
<v Speaker 9>why do we think that it's apocalypse?</v>

4114
01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:05.791
<v Speaker 9>Maybe at some one badass worm becomes a sorcerer and just decides to get back</v>

4115
01:52:05.861 --> 01:52:09.280
<v Speaker 9>all these conti birds that had been fucking with his family for generations.</v>

4116
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:09.911
<v Speaker 9>And you know,</v>

01:52:09.911 --> 01:52:11.980
<v Speaker 9>he's wearing a wizard's robe and he's just,</v>

4118
01:52:11.981 --> 01:52:12.814

4119
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:14.770
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

4120
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:15.341
<v Speaker 9>So this,</v>

4121
01:52:15.341 --> 01:52:15.821
<v Speaker 9>this bid,</v>

4122
01:52:15.821 --> 01:52:15.971
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

4123
01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:18.880
<v Speaker 9>it's turned into a bit and it came out out of nowhere.</v>

4124
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:19.361
<v Speaker 9>Literally.</v>

4125
01:52:19.361 --> 01:52:20.770
<v Speaker 9>I had no idea what I was going to say,</v>

4126
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:24.010
<v Speaker 9>but I knew that if I had no nothing there,</v>

4127
01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.090
<v Speaker 9>I have another bid ready.</v>

4128
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.110
<v Speaker 9>That is actually a bit.</v>

4129
01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:26.860
<v Speaker 9>All right.</v>

4130
01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:28.690
<v Speaker 9>And so because you have like these little,</v>

4131
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:30.220
<v Speaker 9>these little bridges,</v>

4132
01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:30.761
<v Speaker 9>you know that,</v>

4133
01:52:30.761 --> 01:52:32.090
<v Speaker 9>you know that you have this be,</v>

4134
01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 9>this bridge is built.</v>

4135
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:35.800
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to go right into fire at the San Francisco Hotel.</v>

4136
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:36.341
<v Speaker 9>Boom.</v>

4137
01:52:36.341 --> 01:52:36.881
<v Speaker 9>It's right there.</v>

4138
01:52:36.881 --> 01:52:37.714
<v Speaker 9>It's solid.</v>

4139
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.560
<v Speaker 9>And so I know that I can take a chance like let's just swing off this vine and</v>

4140
01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:43.630
<v Speaker 9>hope I can catch that bridge or you know,</v>

4141
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 9>or catch up on that.</v>

4142
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:45.440
<v Speaker 9>I didn't know was there.</v>

4143
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.270
<v Speaker 9>How cool is it when that start,</v>

4144
01:52:47.271 --> 01:52:51.140
<v Speaker 9>when you start killing and you're improvising and your end depth bizarre like</v>

4145
01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:54.320
<v Speaker 9>wave where suddenly you're not doing any jokes and then</v>

4146
01:52:55.190 --> 01:53:00.010
<v Speaker 7>sometimes I've improvised and done well and then tried to go back and do it.</v>

4147
01:53:00.011 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 7>Joke.</v>

4148
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:01.101
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4149
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:04.400
<v Speaker 9>And it doesn't do as well because they were so used to that stuff that was</v>

4150
01:53:04.401 --> 01:53:05.420
<v Speaker 9>coming in the moment.</v>

4151
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.901
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

4152
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:08.930
<v Speaker 9>Like that's a weird thing man where you can tell too.</v>

4153
01:53:08.931 --> 01:53:09.531
<v Speaker 9>They feel it.</v>

4154
01:53:09.531 --> 01:53:10.101
<v Speaker 9>They sense it.</v>

4155
01:53:10.101 --> 01:53:11.610
<v Speaker 9>He's doing material as well.</v>

4156
01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:13.860
<v Speaker 9>And then also they can tell that you're free ball and two,</v>

4157
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:15.920
<v Speaker 9>I can tell him when Joey Diaz free balls,</v>

4158
01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.620
<v Speaker 9>like sometimes I'll run up to him offstage.</v>

4159
01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 9>I go,</v>

4160
01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:18.980
<v Speaker 9>did you plan that one?</v>

4161
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:19.431
<v Speaker 9>And they'll go,</v>

4162
01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:19.760
<v Speaker 9>Nah,</v>

4163
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.020
<v Speaker 9>I fucking came up with the right there.</v>

4164
01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:21.591
<v Speaker 9>Like the,</v>

4165
01:53:21.591 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 9>he did a joke about his dick,</v>

4166
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:25.040
<v Speaker 9>but he was doing his thing about Viagra.</v>

4167
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 9>This was the Sunday night show him [inaudible] he was doing the thing about you</v>

4168
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:29.030
<v Speaker 9>and you'd have a copter dead Dick.</v>

4169
01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 9>He never cut the dead Dick.</v>

4170
01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:30.621
<v Speaker 9>He goes,</v>

4171
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:31.454
<v Speaker 9>if your Dick's dead,</v>

4172
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:32.180
<v Speaker 9>this is what you do.</v>

4173
01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.520
<v Speaker 9>You go out of total fucking refrigerator,</v>

4174
01:53:33.521 --> 01:53:35.850
<v Speaker 9>you'd get those popsicle sticks and your rep that Dick Up.</v>

4175
01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 9>I got fucking wounded soldier send it back in.</v>

4176
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:40.310
<v Speaker 9>He was talking about putting your ticket,</v>

4177
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 9>a splint with popsicle sticks and the way you saying it,</v>

4178
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:44.720
<v Speaker 9>it was fucking,</v>

4179
01:53:44.721 --> 01:53:45.800
<v Speaker 9>it was so it was,</v>

4180
01:53:45.801 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 9>there's a feeling of magic as he was saying this and he is killing before he</v>

4181
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:51.110
<v Speaker 9>says this.</v>

4182
01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:54.520
<v Speaker 9>So he goes into this like red faced like Joey Diaz,</v>

4183
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:55.363
<v Speaker 9>purple faced,</v>

4184
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:57.140
<v Speaker 9>screaming spits flying out.</v>

4185
01:53:57.141 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 9>You never copped a dead Dick.</v>

4186
01:53:58.730 --> 01:54:00.800
<v Speaker 9>You send that thick in like a wounded soldier.</v>

4187
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:03.440
<v Speaker 9>And me and Ari were fucking crying,</v>

4188
01:54:03.441 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 9>laughing and I couldn't wait to for him to get off stage so I could ask him.</v>

4189
01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 9>Was that off the top of your head today?</v>

4190
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 9>He said it came out of nowhere.</v>

4191
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:11.150
<v Speaker 9>Just came out of nowhere.</v>

4192
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:14.510
<v Speaker 9>Like all of a sudden it seemed like a bit like it was all there and it was</v>

4193
01:54:14.511 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 9>because he was willing to swing just to take this chance and see where,</v>

4194
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:19.723
<v Speaker 9>where it brings you.</v>

4195
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 9>You have to be able to do that though in front of several hundred people is</v>

4196
01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:23.630
<v Speaker 9>rare.</v>

4197
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:24.351
<v Speaker 9>Like you,</v>

4198
01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 9>your stage right now,</v>

4199
01:54:25.581 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 9>you can't quite do that yet.</v>

4200
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 9>What your stage right now when you got to do is you've got to write things down.</v>

4201
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:35.550
<v Speaker 9>Well my at that though with the come on your face that that was made up onstage.</v>

4202
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:36.951
<v Speaker 9>What Ben?</v>

4203
01:54:36.951 --> 01:54:38.210
<v Speaker 9>Is that the pets?</v>

4204
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.830
<v Speaker 9>Oh well yeah that was a line you came up with a line for an already existing</v>

4205
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:43.220
<v Speaker 9>pit?</v>

4206
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:43.370
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4207
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.530
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

4208
01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:43.780
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

4209
01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:45.540
<v Speaker 7>That whole bit was written onstage.</v>

4210
01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.030
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

4211
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4212
01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:47.920
<v Speaker 7>And it just came up on one day.</v>

4213
01:54:47.921 --> 01:54:48.101
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

4214
01:54:48.101 --> 01:54:49.000
<v Speaker 7>it was the Sunday show.</v>

4215
01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:49.281
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4216
01:54:49.281 --> 01:54:50.021
<v Speaker 7>so that's what I been talking about.</v>

4217
01:54:50.021 --> 01:54:53.670
<v Speaker 7>I'll do that all the time where I'll think just like either on stage or walk.</v>

4218
01:54:53.671 --> 01:54:54.400
<v Speaker 7>Right when I'm going to,</v>

4219
01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.830
<v Speaker 7>like the other day I had this thing where it</v>

4220
01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:57.780
<v Speaker 9>talking about that before you ever did it on stage,</v>

4221
01:54:57.781 --> 01:54:58.170
<v Speaker 9>Brian,</v>

4222
01:54:58.170 --> 01:54:59.730
<v Speaker 9>you've talked about that a few times.</v>

4223
01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:02.250
<v Speaker 9>What before you had been talked about the ex girlfriends,</v>

4224
01:55:02.251 --> 01:55:02.730
<v Speaker 9>how the you,</v>

4225
01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:05.220
<v Speaker 9>you have these pets from them and they all have the same personality.</v>

4226
01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:05.831
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4227
01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:06.664
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't it,</v>

4228
01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 7>I mean when the first time I went to,</v>

4229
01:55:07.961 --> 01:55:08.800
<v Speaker 7>I thought of that bit,</v>

4230
01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:09.580
<v Speaker 7>I was sick,</v>

4231
01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.730
<v Speaker 7>seriously waiting for the [inaudible] in front of me to get off stage and I'm</v>

4232
01:55:12.731 --> 01:55:16.270
<v Speaker 7>just thinking like I got to do something about my animals cause I flick,</v>

4233
01:55:16.271 --> 01:55:17.590
<v Speaker 7>I'm a single mom right now.</v>

4234
01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:19.090
<v Speaker 7>And so I went on stage and they've said,</v>

4235
01:55:19.210 --> 01:55:19.451
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

4236
01:55:19.451 --> 01:55:19.631
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4237
01:55:19.631 --> 01:55:20.560
<v Speaker 7>I feel like a single mom.</v>

4238
01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:22.620
<v Speaker 9>Oh blogging when you talk to me about it,</v>

4239
01:55:22.621 --> 01:55:23.760
<v Speaker 9>you'd already done it on stage.</v>

4240
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:24.241
<v Speaker 9>Maybe it's that.</v>

4241
01:55:24.241 --> 01:55:24.490
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4242
01:55:24.490 --> 01:55:25.323
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4243
01:55:25.330 --> 01:55:26.310
<v Speaker 9>I don't like when people do that,</v>

4244
01:55:26.311 --> 01:55:28.710
<v Speaker 9>when they pretend they're having a conversation with you and really they're</v>

4245
01:55:28.711 --> 01:55:29.580
<v Speaker 9>trying out material.</v>

4246
01:55:29.610 --> 01:55:30.443
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

4247
01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.820
<v Speaker 7>What's worse is when it's very obvious.</v>

4248
01:55:33.821 --> 01:55:34.001
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4249
01:55:34.001 --> 01:55:36.640
<v Speaker 7>some people could actually get away with it cause you're like telling the joke</v>

4250
01:55:36.641 --> 01:55:38.830
<v Speaker 7>and they think you know it's funny but some people just,</v>

4251
01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.150
<v Speaker 7>you could tell they just doing bits.</v>

4252
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 7>There's a</v>

4253
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:42.380
<v Speaker 9>dude I used to play pool with and it was brutal.</v>

4254
01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:43.920
<v Speaker 9>He was a comic and he used to go</v>

4255
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 1>tell me if you think there's anything in this,</v>

4256
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.333
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4257
01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.320
<v Speaker 9>don't drop my head down.</v>

4258
01:55:49.321 --> 01:55:52.590
<v Speaker 9>He didn't have a whole lot of friends and he was like really into his comedy and</v>

4259
01:55:52.591 --> 01:55:53.251
<v Speaker 9>he was one of those guys.</v>

4260
01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:57.660
<v Speaker 9>He was a decent comic but he wrote out every fucking joke as he would say it on</v>

4261
01:55:57.661 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 9>stage.</v>

4262
01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 9>So it never seemed like when he was on stage it was really just up there fucking</v>

4263
01:56:02.041 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 9>around.</v>

4264
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.233
<v Speaker 9>It always seemed like,</v>

4265
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:05.850
<v Speaker 9>here's some material that I wrote today,</v>

4266
01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.670

4267
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:11.760
<v Speaker 9>And so he like holds me hostage there while we're playing pool.</v>

4268
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:14.910
<v Speaker 9>And while he says out the whole joke,</v>

4269
01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 9>you know like literally,</v>

4270
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 9>have you ever noticed like he gives me a hug</v>

4271
01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.770

4274
01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.230
<v Speaker 1>have you ever noticed,</v>

4275
01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you ever notice?</v>

4276
01:56:24.670 --> 01:56:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a lot of shit dude.</v>

4277
01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:27.100
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about other shit?</v>

4278
01:56:27.101 --> 01:56:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I noticed man,</v>

4279
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the Pr,</v>

4280
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:30.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with comedy man.</v>

4281
01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.720
<v Speaker 1>There's like gay comedy,</v>

4282
01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.160
<v Speaker 1>but they're like the shitty comedian is a pathetic figure.</v>

4283
01:56:36.161 --> 01:56:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Managed is such a rough mode of being man.</v>

4284
01:56:39.581 --> 01:56:40.414
<v Speaker 1>It's such a,</v>

4285
01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:43.180
<v Speaker 1>such a silly embarrassing existence.</v>

4286
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:44.920
<v Speaker 9>What's the idea that you,</v>

4287
01:56:44.921 --> 01:56:47.430
<v Speaker 9>you command the attention of the crowd.</v>

4288
01:56:47.431 --> 01:56:47.851
<v Speaker 9>You are,</v>

4289
01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:49.350
<v Speaker 9>your voice is amplified.</v>

4290
01:56:49.590 --> 01:56:49.771
<v Speaker 9>Your,</v>

4291
01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:53.190
<v Speaker 9>there's a light spot put on you and you are supposedly,</v>

4292
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4293
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:57.810
<v Speaker 9>so entertaining and interesting that all you have to do is talk and you're going</v>

4294
01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 9>to grab the attention of all these people in this room and you're requesting</v>

4295
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:04.980
<v Speaker 9>this exorbitant amount of attention.</v>

4296
01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 9>And it's because you claim to have this skill and this skill is you're going to</v>

4297
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 9>elicit laughter.</v>

4298
01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 9>Going to extract laughter from the audience.</v>

4299
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4300
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:12.833
<v Speaker 9>Good luck.</v>

4301
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:14.380
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird lately.</v>

4302
01:57:14.381 --> 01:57:17.840
<v Speaker 1>If I have been noticing there's this whole breed of comic,</v>

4303
01:57:17.890 --> 01:57:18.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4304
01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.090
<v Speaker 1>open miker mostly,</v>

4305
01:57:20.091 --> 01:57:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4306
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4307
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.231
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4308
01:57:21.231 --> 01:57:22.640
<v Speaker 1>that does their whole act,</v>

4309
01:57:22.641 --> 01:57:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but not once did you think no,</v>

4310
01:57:24.741 --> 01:57:25.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a joke there.</v>

4311
01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like,</v>

4312
01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 1>like they're just talking and like the,</v>

4313
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:30.920
<v Speaker 1>they're forgetting that this is supposed to be funny.</v>

4314
01:57:30.921 --> 01:57:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Almost like they're almost saying a story and when they're done with the story,</v>

4315
01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:35.420
<v Speaker 1>they expect you to clap it,</v>

4316
01:57:35.421 --> 01:57:36.170
<v Speaker 1>then you'd,</v>

4317
01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4318
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:37.191
<v Speaker 1>nothing in,</v>

4319
01:57:37.191 --> 01:57:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it was even a joke where it's like,</v>

4320
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:41.360
<v Speaker 1>is that their sense of humor is that bad?</v>

4321
01:57:41.361 --> 01:57:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Or they just don't get thorough conquers open?</v>

4322
01:57:44.451 --> 01:57:45.251
<v Speaker 1>Miker so you're,</v>

4323
01:57:45.251 --> 01:57:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

4324
01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying like,</v>

4325
01:57:46.821 --> 01:57:47.930
<v Speaker 1>how come this guy who,</v>

4326
01:57:47.931 --> 01:57:48.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4327
01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:48.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4328
01:57:48.741 --> 01:57:50.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know how to throw a punch at all things.</v>

4329
01:57:50.121 --> 01:57:51.290
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be on the ultimate fighter.</v>

4330
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:51.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4331
01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4332
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you're just there.</v>

4333
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 1>They're not good.</v>

4334
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:54.270
<v Speaker 1>They're in Compton.</v>

4335
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing that people can be that bad though.</v>

4336
01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.520
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing is that can be that bad forever.</v>

4337
01:57:58.521 --> 01:57:58.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4338
01:57:58.731 --> 01:58:00.290
<v Speaker 1>how many dudes you've ever seen at the comedy store?</v>

4339
01:58:00.291 --> 01:58:03.500
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing standup for 10 plus years doing open mics and they're still</v>

4340
01:58:03.501 --> 01:58:05.570
<v Speaker 1>like brutally so insane.</v>

4341
01:58:05.690 --> 01:58:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you use it for Gri?</v>

4342
01:58:07.041 --> 01:58:10.130
<v Speaker 1>You should progress like you're talented in the opposite way.</v>

4343
01:58:10.131 --> 01:58:14.270
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you haven't gotten better at all and you've been doing it for some</v>

4344
01:58:14.271 --> 01:58:15.470
<v Speaker 1>people 15 years,</v>

4345
01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can get better if you're not good at all.</v>

4346
01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4347
01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:20.980
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4348
01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:24.320
<v Speaker 9>there are some guys that get into comedy that truly don't understand what comedy</v>

4349
01:58:24.321 --> 01:58:26.720
<v Speaker 9>is and they see other people doing it and talking it,</v>

4350
01:58:26.721 --> 01:58:30.980
<v Speaker 9>but they're so socially unaware that they don't know how they come off to other</v>

4351
01:58:30.981 --> 01:58:33.860
<v Speaker 9>people and they probably don't have the tools,</v>

4352
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:35.450
<v Speaker 9>the psychological tools,</v>

4353
01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.680
<v Speaker 9>the cognitive tools to really objectively assess their own personality.</v>

4354
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:41.410
<v Speaker 9>So they're never going to be able to do right.</v>

4355
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.610
<v Speaker 9>Literally are never going to be,</v>

4356
01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:45.960
<v Speaker 9>you have to have a certain amount of awareness in order to do standup.</v>

4357
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 9>And there's a lot of people that attempt it.</v>

4358
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:48.490
<v Speaker 9>They just don't have that.</v>

4359
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:49.473
<v Speaker 9>They don't have it.</v>

4360
01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 9>And if you don't have it,</v>

4361
01:58:50.351 --> 01:58:50.950
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

4362
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:51.750

4363
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:53.020
<v Speaker 9>there's something has to happen.</v>

4364
01:58:53.021 --> 01:58:53.561
<v Speaker 9>Dramatic.</v>

4365

<v Speaker 9>You got to go to Mexico and do Ibogaine Iowasca me,</v>

4366
01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.110

4367
01:58:58.110 --> 01:58:58.570
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.970
<v Speaker 9>You literally have to become a different person.</v>

4374
01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 9>The person that you are is just you.</v>

<v Speaker 9>You know you're not equipped for it.</v>

4386
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:22.480
<v Speaker 9>You have to change your equipment,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what it takes.</v>

01:59:25.431 --> 01:59:29.060
<v Speaker 4>The snake must shed its God damn skin from time to time.</v>

4391

4402
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:50.700

<v Speaker 9>Evan.</v>

4404
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:51.241
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

4405
01:59:51.241 --> 01:59:54.750
<v Speaker 9>we never say off the top of this bug is off this script that we'd been</v>

4406
01:59:54.751 --> 01:59:55.700
<v Speaker 9>rehearsing for the last,</v>

4407
01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:56.580
<v Speaker 9>I was raised Catholic.</v>

4408
01:59:56.581 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4409
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:57.843
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4410
01:59:58.100 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 4>and in,</v>

4411
01:59:58.450 --> 01:59:58.870
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

4412
01:59:58.870 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 4>in religion there's this idea of tithing where you're supposed to get your 10%</v>

4413
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:04.450
<v Speaker 4>of your income income to the church.</v>

4414
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.100
<v Speaker 4>So dude,</v>

4415
02:00:06.101 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 4>I've started thinking about that and I've started thinking like how fucking</v>

4416
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:14.761
<v Speaker 4>interesting would your life get if you decided to give 10% of your income,</v>

4417
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:16.750
<v Speaker 4>not to the church,</v>

4418
02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:21.990
<v Speaker 4>but you decided to like give 10% of your income to do like really cool things</v>

4419
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 4>for people randomly.</v>

4420
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:27.303
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4421
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:27.971
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

4422
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:28.380
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4423
02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Your own sort of the church offering.</v>

4424
02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:30.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4425
02:00:30.911 --> 02:00:33.850
<v Speaker 4>But it's not no churches involved or anything you'd just like,</v>

4426
02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:38.110
<v Speaker 4>cause like the man like to go back to the idea of psychedelic states,</v>

4427
02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 4>things that induce psychedelic states.</v>

4428
02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Fucking helping someone randomly that doesn't expect you to like if you go out</v>

4429
02:00:46.061 --> 02:00:47.080
<v Speaker 4>and you think I'm going to go,</v>

4430
02:00:47.710 --> 02:00:51.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big fan of giving money to like people in front of seven 11 you were</v>

4431
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:52.630
<v Speaker 4>like covered in sores.</v>

4432
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's like kind of like a way of killing somebody.</v>

4433
02:00:55.990 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 4>But like if you go out and have some extra money and decided I'm going to do</v>

4434
02:01:00.641 --> 02:01:05.380
<v Speaker 4>something cool with this or you just try to like convert your financial energy</v>

4435
02:01:05.610 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 4>and to some positive thing that you randomly do for someone and you decide I'm</v>

4436
02:01:09.581 --> 02:01:12.430
<v Speaker 4>going to do this from two to four o'clock today.</v>

4437
02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.353
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4438
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:14.710
<v Speaker 4>That puts you in the weirdest,</v>

4439
02:01:14.711 --> 02:01:18.850
<v Speaker 4>most psychedelic state and when you do some random good thing for somebody,</v>

4440
02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:19.571
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4441
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 4>it blows people's minds.</v>

4442
02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Like they freak the fuck out.</v>

4443
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.500
<v Speaker 4>Like the look on their faces,</v>

4444
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:29.520
<v Speaker 4>like what just happened to me because everything is inverted and our society</v>

4445
02:01:30.551 --> 02:01:31.690
<v Speaker 4>towards the south,</v>

4446
02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.150
<v Speaker 4>everyone is always thinking about themselves.</v>

4447
02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's always fixating on themselves.</v>

4448
02:01:36.341 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 4>If if for two hours you don't fixate on yourself long enough to go</v>

4449
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 9>do some random fucking thing for somebody.</v>

4450
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.431
<v Speaker 9>Dude,</v>

4451
02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:44.270
<v Speaker 9>it's trippy.</v>

4452
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 9>I definitely think that it put an energy in towards,</v>

4453
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:47.091
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4454
02:01:47.091 --> 02:01:47.361
<v Speaker 9>any,</v>

4455
02:01:47.361 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 9>any sort of charitable notion,</v>

4456
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.760
<v Speaker 9>any,</v>

4457
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.680
<v Speaker 9>anything where you re helping people.</v>

4458
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:52.551
<v Speaker 9>It definitely is the,</v>

4459
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 9>the right kind of energy to put out there in the world.</v>

4460
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 9>It definitely can induce,</v>

4461
02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:57.290
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4462
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:58.520
<v Speaker 9>a different state of mind,</v>

4463
02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 9>a different state of being.</v>

4464
02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.250
<v Speaker 9>But if the charity thing,</v>

4465
02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.473
<v Speaker 9>which is great,</v>

4466
02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 9>I mean anything is good like,</v>

4467
02:02:03.651 --> 02:02:04.370
<v Speaker 9>but when you know,</v>

4468
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 9>you call it and you give money to somebody or you have some kind of fund that</v>

4469
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 9>you put money into the outstanding I'm talking about like physically,</v>

4470
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.311
<v Speaker 9>I know what you're saying.</v>

4471
02:02:12.311 --> 02:02:12.611
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

4472
02:02:12.611 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4473
02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:13.941
<v Speaker 9>How many charitable,</v>

4474
02:02:13.941 --> 02:02:15.680
<v Speaker 9>I mean like going out and helping people.</v>

4475
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:16.491
<v Speaker 9>I definitely agree.</v>

4476
02:02:16.491 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4477
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 9>how many of these fucking organizations keep getting busted charitable</v>

4478
02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 9>organizations when you find out like,</v>

4479
02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:21.590
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

4480
02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 9>the white club John Thing for Haiti and you know that you find out they're all</v>

4481
02:02:24.651 --> 02:02:26.210
<v Speaker 9>stealing money and it's like,</v>

4482
02:02:26.211 --> 02:02:26.661
<v Speaker 9>it's always,</v>

4483
02:02:26.661 --> 02:02:27.410
<v Speaker 9>it's always some,</v>

4484
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 9>something like that was always going down,</v>

4485
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 9>doing random cool things for people.</v>

4486
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:32.121
<v Speaker 9>It does,</v>

4487
02:02:32.121 --> 02:02:32.360
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4488

4489
02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:35.780
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

4490
02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.110
<v Speaker 9>when I gave away my isolation tank on time,</v>

4491
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:38.990
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

4492
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.570
<v Speaker 9>that was a,</v>

4493
02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:41.210
<v Speaker 9>one of the coolest things I ever did because,</v>

4494

<v Speaker 9>I mean this is fucking $8,000 a piece of equipment and some dude,</v>

4497
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:50.510
<v Speaker 9>Salt was like 1200 bucks and then had it moved to his house,</v>

4498
02:02:50.511 --> 02:02:50.691
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4499
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 9>I had to pay for a moving company and then I had to pay for an installer to go</v>

4500
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:54.680
<v Speaker 9>install it in his house.</v>

4501
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:55.021
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4502
02:02:55.021 --> 02:02:57.260
<v Speaker 9>one of the fucking guy doesn't even use it at bastard.</v>

4507
02:03:00.590 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 9>Do you have a place that it works out?</v>

4508
02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.720
<v Speaker 9>The best place to have it.</v>

4509
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:05.160
<v Speaker 9>Perfect place for a day.</v>

4510
02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:06.043
<v Speaker 9>You need to get one.</v>

4515
02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 9>I got a place right next to a shower where it could just,</v>

4516
02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.580
<v Speaker 9>I could basically go right from the flotation world needs Duncan Trussell to</v>

4517
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:19.920
<v Speaker 9>have a fucking isolation tank.</v>

4518
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 9>God hear my prayer.</v>

4519
02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 9>Really?</v>

4520
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:24.860
<v Speaker 9>You need to mix horizon iPhone.</v>

4521
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:25.191
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4522
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:25.491
<v Speaker 9>What do you,</v>

4523
02:03:25.491 --> 02:03:26.324
<v Speaker 9>what you are with,</v>

4524
02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:26.990
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

4525
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.680
<v Speaker 9>with a,</v>

4526
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.513
<v Speaker 9>well you've got,</v>

4527
02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.050
<v Speaker 9>you've got a couple of different projects going on,</v>

4528
02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.580
<v Speaker 9>but when one of these hits,</v>

4529
02:03:31.581 --> 02:03:31.910
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

4530
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 9>when you get your first fat check and we're going to get you,</v>

4531
02:03:34.251 --> 02:03:35.570
<v Speaker 9>if this guy won't give up the time,</v>

4532
02:03:35.571 --> 02:03:36.740
<v Speaker 9>I don't think this guy wants to give up his tank.</v>

4533
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:37.220
<v Speaker 9>I think he's getting,</v>

4534
02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.450
<v Speaker 9>he's going through a divorce now though.</v>

4535
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:40.370
<v Speaker 9>So he might have to move the tank.</v>

4536
02:03:40.371 --> 02:03:42.110
<v Speaker 9>You might not have the money to reset the tank up.</v>

4537
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:42.800
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

4538
02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.720
<v Speaker 9>I'll store it for him.</v>

4539
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:46.880
<v Speaker 9>I talked to him about it like a year after I sent it to him and he's like,</v>

4540
02:03:46.881 --> 02:03:47.091
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

4541
02:03:47.091 --> 02:03:47.901
<v Speaker 9>I hardly ever use it.</v>

4542
02:03:47.901 --> 02:03:48.171
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

4543
02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:49.340
<v Speaker 9>you fuck.</v>

4544
02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:50.091
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

4545
02:03:50.091 --> 02:03:51.950
<v Speaker 9>God damn happened to do it randomly.</v>

4546
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:52.551
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

4547
02:03:52.551 --> 02:03:53.121
<v Speaker 9>but you know,</v>

4548
02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:54.170
<v Speaker 9>I figured anybody that was,</v>

4549
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.020
<v Speaker 9>I mean he and the guy was like a wannabe standup comedian.</v>

4550
02:03:57.021 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 9>He's like trying to be a comic.</v>

4551
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:59.990
<v Speaker 9>It's like Jesus Christ,</v>

4552
02:03:59.991 --> 02:04:00.171
<v Speaker 9>dude,</v>

4553
02:04:00.171 --> 02:04:03.290
<v Speaker 9>I gave you a fucking doorway to the universe and you don't open it and go</v>

4554
02:04:03.291 --> 02:04:03.591
<v Speaker 9>through it.</v>

4555
02:04:03.591 --> 02:04:04.251
<v Speaker 9>Every now and then.</v>

4556
02:04:04.251 --> 02:04:05.900
<v Speaker 9>He's got his old checks in there.</v>

4557
02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.250
<v Speaker 9>I bet there's no water in it.</v>

4558
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:08.790
<v Speaker 9>He just puts all boxes in it.</v>

4559
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 9>I was thinking I would have just built a shed.</v>

4560
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.250
<v Speaker 9>I just build a shed for a washer and dryer.</v>

4561
02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:14.090
<v Speaker 9>You know how easy it would have been.</v>

4562
02:04:14.091 --> 02:04:15.320
<v Speaker 9>Just a build a shed for that.</v>

4563
02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 9>That would be,</v>

4564
02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:16.910
<v Speaker 9>would you have used it though?</v>

4565
02:04:17.090 --> 02:04:17.891
<v Speaker 9>I've never been in one,</v>

4566
02:04:17.891 --> 02:04:19.820
<v Speaker 9>so I'll probably say it.</v>

4567
02:04:20.110 --> 02:04:21.200
<v Speaker 9>I'd never been in one,</v>

4568
02:04:21.201 --> 02:04:22.010
<v Speaker 9>so probably.</v>

4569
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.401
<v Speaker 9>But yeah,</v>

4570
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:24.860
<v Speaker 9>but I've offered you to go to the soothing solutions.</v>

4571
02:04:24.861 --> 02:04:25.700
<v Speaker 9>You've never gone to that.</v>

4572
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.761
<v Speaker 9>Do you want to go to that?</v>

4573
02:04:26.761 --> 02:04:29.030
<v Speaker 9>Never made the call you want when you want to do it,</v>

4574
02:04:29.031 --> 02:04:29.430
<v Speaker 9>I'll do it.</v>

4575
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:30.263
<v Speaker 9>We'll set it up,</v>

4576
02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:31.273
<v Speaker 9>set it up.</v>

4577
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:32.420
<v Speaker 9>Or you can go to float lab.</v>

4578
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:33.620
<v Speaker 9>That's the best place to float.</v>

4579
02:04:33.621 --> 02:04:35.600
<v Speaker 9>Lab ones are on another level they're got Craig,</v>

4580
02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:39.960
<v Speaker 9>if you're in a go to float lab.com and look at what this guy's doing.</v>

4581
02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 9>This guy was making these super fucking thick stainless steel.</v>

4582
02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:45.240
<v Speaker 9>Insulated tanks isn't the greatest.</v>

4583
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:47.280
<v Speaker 9>There is like the apple a flotation.</v>

4584
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4585
02:04:47.610 --> 02:04:49.190
<v Speaker 9>He's just a bad motherfucker.</v>

4586
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.330
<v Speaker 9>He's like this crazy mad scientist dude.</v>

4587
02:04:51.331 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 9>He's like really into floating.</v>

4588
02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:53.670
<v Speaker 9>He's trying to invent some,</v>

4589
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:56.550
<v Speaker 9>some new screen where you can watch.</v>

4590
02:04:56.550 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 9>It's the lowest amount of light is coming through these LCD screens so you can</v>

4591
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:04.400
<v Speaker 9>watch like documentaries inside the tank and you can learn from it learn and it</v>

4592
02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:05.550
<v Speaker 9>helps you have like,</v>

4593
02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:06.510
<v Speaker 9>it defeats the purpose.</v>

4594
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.330
<v Speaker 9>I think so,</v>

4595
02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 9>but I'm not into it at all.</v>

4596
02:05:08.850 --> 02:05:11.150
<v Speaker 9>It's kind of interesting information blasted.</v>

4597
02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:11.730
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4598
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:14.430
<v Speaker 9>that's what he's saying is that when you don't have,</v>

4599
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.470
<v Speaker 9>when you have an absence of sensory input,</v>

4600
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:16.751
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

4601
02:05:16.751 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 9>you can really absorb information in a much faster rate.</v>

4602
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:22.410
<v Speaker 9>And it totally makes sense on paper because the whole idea,</v>

4603
02:05:22.590 --> 02:05:22.831
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4604
02:05:22.831 --> 02:05:23.041
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>

4605
02:05:23.041 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 9>it's very difficult to watch a movie if there's jackhammers going on behind you.</v>

4606
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:28.200
<v Speaker 9>It's distracting you.</v>

4607
02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:33.540
<v Speaker 9>You had a float tank that had a interactive surface on the top of it,</v>

4608
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:38.100
<v Speaker 9>so they can turn completely dark if you want it to.</v>

4609
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.031
<v Speaker 9>But if you want,</v>

4610
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Speaker 9>you could light the entire fucking thing up with like the universe,</v>

4611
02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:44.070
<v Speaker 9>the Milky Way.</v>

4612
02:05:44.290 --> 02:05:44.730
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

4613
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:45.311
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

4614
02:05:45.311 --> 02:05:47.330
<v Speaker 9>It just blue sky or whatever,</v>

4615
02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:52.340
<v Speaker 9>just fucking Sanskrit versus from like all the great scriptures flying on there.</v>

4616
02:05:53.041 --> 02:05:56.510
<v Speaker 9>It'd be incredible Sanskrit versus when did you,</v>

4617
02:05:56.511 --> 02:05:58.200
<v Speaker 9>would you look at the translation?</v>

4618
02:05:58.230 --> 02:05:58.680
<v Speaker 9>Do you,</v>

4619
02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:59.011
<v Speaker 9>do you,</v>

4620
02:05:59.011 --> 02:05:59.400
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4621
02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:01.290
<v Speaker 9>how long would it take to learn Sanskrit?</v>

4622
02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:03.960
<v Speaker 9>I like a 10 year project.</v>

4623
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 9>I think it would take a long fucking time,</v>

4624
02:06:05.611 --> 02:06:07.320
<v Speaker 9>but I don't know if anybody would be into that.</v>

4625
02:06:07.321 --> 02:06:08.280
<v Speaker 9>I would think it would be you.</v>

4626
02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:13.320
<v Speaker 9>I'd love to just because it's Sanskrit and and Tibetan.</v>

4627
02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:18.420
<v Speaker 9>When I'm on mushrooms and I start like you close your eyes and you see those</v>

4628
02:06:18.421 --> 02:06:19.410
<v Speaker 9>weird symbols.</v>

4629
02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 9>I see a gypsum and stuff.</v>

4630
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:22.310
<v Speaker 9>See that's the thing and I always wonder,</v>

4631
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.681
<v Speaker 9>these,</v>

4632
02:06:22.681 --> 02:06:23.580
<v Speaker 9>these symbols are seeing,</v>

4633
02:06:23.581 --> 02:06:25.160
<v Speaker 9>I always think Mayan looking thing.</v>

4634
02:06:25.290 --> 02:06:26.550
<v Speaker 9>I knew how to read this.</v>

4635
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 9>Would I be reading like some kind of message here is this,</v>

4636
02:06:30.211 --> 02:06:33.960
<v Speaker 9>am I actually looking at some kind of scripture?</v>

4637
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:35.250
<v Speaker 9>You know what Mckenna believes?</v>

4638
02:06:35.251 --> 02:06:38.940
<v Speaker 9>Actually what he thought was that when you do a psychedelic,</v>

4639
02:06:38.970 --> 02:06:43.080
<v Speaker 9>what you're doing is your taking part in the experience of everyone else who's</v>

4640
02:06:43.081 --> 02:06:44.850
<v Speaker 9>also done that psychedelic.</v>

4641
02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:45.890
<v Speaker 9>That's why he,</v>

4642
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:50.010
<v Speaker 9>we just described ketamine is such an odd psychedelic because it seems like its</v>

4643
02:06:50.011 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 9>database of users was very,</v>

4644
02:06:51.631 --> 02:06:52.464
<v Speaker 9>very small,</v>

4645
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:56.430
<v Speaker 9>so he said Ketamine felt like an office building that was empty.</v>

4646
02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:00.210
<v Speaker 9>It would go in there and it's just empty cubicles like where is everybody?</v>

4647
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.710
<v Speaker 9>Whereas mushrooms you do it.</v>

4648
02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:06.740
<v Speaker 9>You're dealing with 10,000 years of obsessive daily use by millions of people</v>

4649
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:08.343
<v Speaker 9>over the world.</v>

4650
02:07:08.490 --> 02:07:11.370
<v Speaker 9>And a lot of those being the Mayans mean a Mayans were heavily,</v>

4651
02:07:11.371 --> 02:07:12.570
<v Speaker 9>heavily into mushrooms.</v>

4652
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:13.021
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

4653
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:13.471
<v Speaker 9>when I was,</v>

4654
02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:14.304
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

4655
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.881
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>

4656
02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:15.180
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4657
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:15.920
<v Speaker 9>when I was in a,</v>

4658
02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.700
<v Speaker 9>and Eatsa and I went on a tour,</v>

4659
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:20.010
<v Speaker 9>the guy that took me on a god was a really,</v>

4660
02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:20.910
<v Speaker 9>really interesting guy.</v>

4661
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:21.321
<v Speaker 9>He was a,</v>

4662
02:07:21.321 --> 02:07:22.031
<v Speaker 9>a local,</v>

4663
02:07:22.031 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 9>a university professor who also,</v>

4664
02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:24.690
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4665
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:25.411
<v Speaker 9>did guides,</v>

4666
02:07:25.411 --> 02:07:26.550
<v Speaker 9>like did tours and shit like that.</v>

4667
02:07:26.551 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 9>It's just really deep into the history of it.</v>

4668
02:07:29.251 --> 02:07:31.890
<v Speaker 9>And he just openly talked about the psychedelics,</v>

4669
02:07:31.891 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 9>like how they would take psychedelics and they had all different rooms that they</v>

4670
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:35.200
<v Speaker 9>would know,</v>

4671
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.580
<v Speaker 9>practice different rituals in.</v>

4672
02:07:36.581 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 9>And it's well known that there was a deep,</v>

4673
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:39.500
<v Speaker 9>deep history in Mexico of,</v>

4674
02:07:39.501 --> 02:07:40.870
<v Speaker 9>of psychedelic mushroom use.</v>

4675
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 9>So it's not surprising that when you do mushrooms,</v>

4676
02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.610
<v Speaker 9>and especially if you do mushrooms that you buy in California,</v>

4677
02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:46.151
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4678
02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:46.451
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4679
02:07:46.451 --> 02:07:46.631
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

4680
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:50.110
<v Speaker 9>you're probably getting the same strains that the Mayans,</v>

4681
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:50.420
<v Speaker 9>God,</v>

4682
02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:50.760
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4683
02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 9>you're probably getting those mock those Mexican mushrooms.</v>

4684
02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:53.551
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4685
02:07:53.551 --> 02:07:56.080
<v Speaker 9>You see all sorts of Weird Mayan symbols.</v>

4686
02:07:56.230 --> 02:07:59.710
<v Speaker 9>It's almost like what you're doing is you're somehow or another tapping into</v>

4687
02:07:59.711 --> 02:08:00.430
<v Speaker 9>there,</v>

4688
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:01.300
<v Speaker 9>the past people,</v>

4689
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:02.440
<v Speaker 9>psychedelic experiences.</v>

4690
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 9>Obviously this is all just,</v>

4691
02:08:04.230 --> 02:08:05.250
<v Speaker 4>what are we all going to go?</v>

4692
02:08:05.251 --> 02:08:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Each room's me,</v>

4693
02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:07.140
<v Speaker 4>US three,</v>

4694
02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:09.300
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't do it and we should just go fucking on the beach somewhere.</v>

4695
02:08:09.930 --> 02:08:11.530
<v Speaker 4>As long as they don't have psilocybin.</v>

4696
02:08:11.531 --> 02:08:14.280
<v Speaker 4>And then my love to eat mushrooms that you guys silicide been,</v>

4697
02:08:14.490 --> 02:08:14.970
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>

4698
02:08:14.970 --> 02:08:16.080
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes you trick.</v>

4699
02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.330
<v Speaker 4>As long as they don't have psilocybin in them.</v>

4700
02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to Talki eating mushrooms to 500 buildings by now.</v>

4701
02:08:24.151 --> 02:08:26.270
<v Speaker 4>At least the 3000 or police officers.</v>

4702
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4703
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:28.290
<v Speaker 4>Tentatively listening with a notepad.</v>

4704
02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:30.330
<v Speaker 4>They just said they're going to the beach.</v>

4705
02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:33.990
<v Speaker 4>It's just as ridiculous that mushrooms are illegal as Monsanto trying to,</v>

4706
02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.970
<v Speaker 4>to patent a pig.</v>

4707
02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:37.320
<v Speaker 4>It's just as ridiculous.</v>

4708
02:08:37.410 --> 02:08:37.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4709
02:08:37.770 --> 02:08:41.340
<v Speaker 4>The fuck is one person going to tell you that some spore of,</v>

4710
02:08:41.341 --> 02:08:41.611
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

4711
02:08:41.611 --> 02:08:42.780
<v Speaker 4>of fucking plant,</v>

4712
02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.670
<v Speaker 4>a living organism that grow by the way,</v>

4713
02:08:44.671 --> 02:08:47.300
<v Speaker 4>which is actually closer to a human than plants already here.</v>

4714
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4715
02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:48.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4716
02:08:48.150 --> 02:08:48.721
<v Speaker 4>spores are,</v>

4717
02:08:48.721 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

4718
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:52.620
<v Speaker 4>are closer to Austin then cause they eat organic matter.</v>

4719
02:08:52.630 --> 02:08:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4720
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:54.263
<v Speaker 4>But dude,</v>

4721
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:55.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean how fucking crazy.</v>

4722
02:08:55.411 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that someone feels okay,</v>

4723
02:08:57.030 --> 02:09:01.710
<v Speaker 4>like the enforcing the law if you eat those fucking things that make you see</v>

4724
02:09:01.711 --> 02:09:06.540
<v Speaker 4>some kind of weird transcendental language that the Mayans were trying to copy</v>

4725
02:09:06.541 --> 02:09:06.960
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

4726
02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.591
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

4727
02:09:07.591 --> 02:09:09.330
<v Speaker 4>I think they're seeing a language and they're like,</v>

4728
02:09:09.650 --> 02:09:10.051
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4729
02:09:10.051 --> 02:09:13.470
<v Speaker 4>this is the best way we can replicate this weird language that we were seeing.</v>

4730
02:09:13.471 --> 02:09:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what happened.</v>

4731
02:09:14.371 --> 02:09:14.910
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>

4732
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

4733
02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:19.380
<v Speaker 4>the think did something that produces like that effect.</v>

4734
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:24.830
<v Speaker 4>There are people right now in federal fucking penitentiaries right now laying in</v>

4735
02:09:24.931 --> 02:09:29.310
<v Speaker 4>a car in a federal penitentiary listening to fucking white area and resistance</v>

4736
02:09:29.311 --> 02:09:30.690
<v Speaker 4>murderers jerking off.</v>

4737
02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:31.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4738
02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:35.820
<v Speaker 4>just because you wanted to fucking see the mothership for a second.</v>

4739
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:39.780
<v Speaker 4>You're three doors down from a guy who fixed it as six year old.</v>

4740
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Fuck though.</v>

4741
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:44.610
<v Speaker 4>How is that possible?</v>

4742
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.791
<v Speaker 9>Well actually,</v>

4743
02:09:45.791 --> 02:09:46.001
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4744
02:09:46.001 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 9>nonviolent drug offenders don't get locked up in the same place as people at</v>

4745
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:49.781
<v Speaker 9>fist six year olds.</v>

4746
02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:50.630
<v Speaker 9>But I know what you're saying.</v>

4747
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 9>Just the fact that they're in a cage at all.</v>

4748
02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:52.811
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4749
02:09:52.811 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 9>maybe you do once you get in there and they,</v>

4750
02:09:54.341 --> 02:09:54.910
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4751
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:58.600
<v Speaker 9>one of the fucking Hispanic guys wants a fight with you and your stab him in the</v>

4752
02:09:58.601 --> 02:09:59.390
<v Speaker 9>neck and you know,</v>

4753
02:09:59.390 --> 02:10:01.240
<v Speaker 9>you want up getting a murder wrap on top of it,</v>

4754
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:02.103
<v Speaker 9>which happens.</v>

4755
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:03.880
<v Speaker 9>Shit happens to nonviolent drug offenders.</v>

4756
02:10:03.881 --> 02:10:05.620
<v Speaker 9>They wind up getting much deeper,</v>

4757
02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:06.150
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4758
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:06.340
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4759
02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.790
<v Speaker 9>penalties for something they do while they're actually in prison</v>

4760
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:10.640
<v Speaker 4>to my friend got a Dui,</v>

4761
02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.710
<v Speaker 4>went to fucking county jail.</v>

4762
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:15.370
<v Speaker 4>His jaw was broken within six minutes.</v>

4763
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It was like a Saturday night and they were gang bangers.</v>

4764
02:10:17.481 --> 02:10:18.740
<v Speaker 4>They're yet had to take a piss.</v>

4765
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:20.540
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't let him get to the toilet.</v>

4766
02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:21.460
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4767
02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I gotta Piss.</v>

4768
02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.080
<v Speaker 4>And they just were like,</v>

4769
02:10:24.081 --> 02:10:24.914
<v Speaker 4>what'd you say?</v>

4770
02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:25.813
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

4771
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Boom broke his fucking jaw for what?</v>

4772
02:10:29.630 --> 02:10:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Cause he fucking drove from a club after one extra beer.</v>

4773
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:37.460
<v Speaker 3>That's insane for you shouldn't be lumped up in the same group of people,</v>

4774
02:10:37.461 --> 02:10:37.941
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4775
02:10:37.941 --> 02:10:38.391
<v Speaker 3>then again,</v>

4776
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:41.570
<v Speaker 3>what if your friend slammed into a fucking car and killed someone's kid?</v>

4777
02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:42.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4778
02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:42.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4779
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 3>obviously you don't know how drunk he was and I'm just guessing.</v>

4780
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:46.340
<v Speaker 3>But it's the same thing.</v>

4781
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4782
02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I knew she shouldn't drive drunk and God knows,</v>

4783
02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:49.310
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4784
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying he won't do that again.</v>

4785
02:10:51.070 --> 02:10:51.341
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4786
02:10:51.341 --> 02:10:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Saying that's not the,</v>

4787
02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4788
02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 3>well I don't know.</v>

4789
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:54.763
<v Speaker 3>What'd you get raped?</v>

4790
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 3>He shouldn't have had that beer.</v>

4791
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:56.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4792
02:10:56.271 --> 02:10:57.350
<v Speaker 3>that's what she get.</v>

4793
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what you get.</v>

4794
02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked up,</v>

4795
02:11:00.651 --> 02:11:00.891
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4796
02:11:00.891 --> 02:11:01.230
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

4797
02:11:01.230 --> 02:11:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4798
02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that people should be penalized for,</v>

4799
02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:07.670
<v Speaker 3>for putting other people in danger because they're drunk and responsible,</v>

4800
02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.450
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to things like mushrooms,</v>

4801
02:11:09.451 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 3>which comes to psychedelic experiences and,</v>

4802
02:11:11.841 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 3>and the idea that you can make any sort of plant that grows here or fungus that</v>

4803
02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:17.060
<v Speaker 3>grows here naturally,</v>

4804
02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:18.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of the ecosystem already.</v>

4805
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Way before,</v>

4806
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:19.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4807
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:21.980
<v Speaker 3>we invented this is fucking completely ridiculous.</v>

4808
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you look at all the stuff that is legal and all the stuff that</v>

4809
02:11:25.941 --> 02:11:28.340
<v Speaker 3>can kill you and all this stuff that you could buy at any store.</v>

4810
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.050
<v Speaker 3>It's completely silly.</v>

4811
02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

4812
02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:32.090
<v Speaker 3>there's no logic behind it.</v>

4813
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:34.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this is like a rational decision,</v>

4814
02:11:34.251 --> 02:11:37.340
<v Speaker 3>like you're obviously deciding what I can and can't do.</v>

4815
02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:40.280
<v Speaker 3>You're deciding what kind of experiences I have and you're,</v>

4816
02:11:40.281 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 3>there's no science behind it.</v>

4817
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:45.080
<v Speaker 3>This is not 1950 you can't pull some McCarthyism bullshit on me.</v>

4818
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I can get online and I can say,</v>

4819
02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:46.761
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

4820
02:11:46.761 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 3>no one's died from Silva Simon.</v>

4821
02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 3>How come silicide means illegal?</v>

4822
02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:49.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4823
02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:50.511
<v Speaker 3>look here,</v>

4824
02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I can show you a thousand different people that will tell you that.</v>

4825
02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:53.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4826
02:11:53.710 --> 02:11:55.850
<v Speaker 3>they've got over posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

4827
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten over,</v>

4828
02:11:56.901 --> 02:11:57.890
<v Speaker 3>you know addiction's.</v>

4829
02:11:57.891 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten over all these things because of psychedelic experiences.</v>

4830
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:02.210
<v Speaker 3>When you're telling me that it's illegal,</v>

4831
02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:03.011
<v Speaker 3>you're telling me that it's,</v>

4832
02:12:03.011 --> 02:12:03.844
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>

4833
02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Why is it bad?</v>

4834
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal with anything.</v>

4835
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's something that people can benefit from and people have all</v>

4836
02:12:13.791 --> 02:12:15.470
<v Speaker 3>these stories about and people,</v>

4837
02:12:15.471 --> 02:12:15.741
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4838
02:12:15.741 --> 02:12:15.980
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4839
02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:20.900
<v Speaker 3>there's an area to explore and someone's keeping you from doing that and trying</v>

4840
02:12:20.901 --> 02:12:22.430
<v Speaker 3>to lock you in jail.</v>

4841
02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 3>If you do do that,</v>

4842
02:12:24.110 --> 02:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>they're the fucking criminal.</v>

4843
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:26.630
<v Speaker 3>The monsters.</v>

4844
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:27.770
<v Speaker 3>They're the monsters.</v>

4845
02:12:27.771 --> 02:12:30.710
<v Speaker 3>They are the fucking criminals of the human race.</v>

4846
02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 3>You or point,</v>

4847
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:34.040
<v Speaker 3>you were putting a crime on people.</v>

4848
02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:37.250
<v Speaker 3>You are literally stopping people from evolving.</v>

4849
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:38.103
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4850
02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:38.650
<v Speaker 3>That it,</v>

4851
02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:40.280
<v Speaker 3>the fucking demon stopped doing it.</v>

4852
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:41.114
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin.</v>

4853
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I like to put people in jail.</v>

4854
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin's all about constricting.</v>

4855
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.001
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

4856
02:12:47.001 --> 02:12:50.300
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I love more than having a mushroom addict in the back.</v>

4857
02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.620
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to explore it.</v>

4858
02:12:51.621 --> 02:12:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Ball gags and whips someday with you diapers.</v>

4859
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:56.003
<v Speaker 3>You remember why the F</v>

4860
02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:58.900
<v Speaker 3>do you remember coming up and saying that?</v>

4861
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:00.920
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

4862
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Ball gags dog.</v>

4863
02:13:02.321 --> 02:13:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4864
02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>

4865
02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I won't say,</v>

4866
02:13:03.610 --> 02:13:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

4867
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.660
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4868
02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:06.250
<v Speaker 7>we talked to Steve o today and he,</v>

4869
02:13:06.251 --> 02:13:07.660
<v Speaker 7>he's completely sober now.</v>

4870
02:13:07.661 --> 02:13:09.670
<v Speaker 7>He stopped smoking cigarettes.</v>

4871
02:13:09.671 --> 02:13:10.451
<v Speaker 7>Stop drinking.</v>

4872
02:13:10.451 --> 02:13:10.781
<v Speaker 7>He was doing,</v>

4873
02:13:10.781 --> 02:13:13.540
<v Speaker 7>he said he was doing so much drugs the last couple of years of his life.</v>

4874
02:13:13.541 --> 02:13:16.300
<v Speaker 7>There was people walking around his house that didn't exist.</v>

4875
02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:17.620
<v Speaker 7>That's how bad it got,</v>

4876
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:21.670
<v Speaker 7>but now he just quit everything in and now is Vegan and isn't that crazy to you</v>

4877
02:13:21.671 --> 02:13:24.850
<v Speaker 7>to think that that somebody that gets an a toit was shit,</v>

4878
02:13:24.851 --> 02:13:26.110
<v Speaker 7>it's still concerned about his health,</v>

4879
02:13:26.111 --> 02:13:28.260
<v Speaker 7>that he's eating Vegan and not on anything?</v>

4880
02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:28.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4881
02:13:28.551 --> 02:13:28.821
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

4882
02:13:28.821 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>he's probably realizing how silly his life was and he's like,</v>

4883
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:32.341
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4884
02:13:32.341 --> 02:13:33.750
<v Speaker 9>putting himself back in line.</v>

4885
02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:34.021
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

4886
02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 9>but what's the logical step to put yourself as far in line as you can and go</v>

4887
02:13:38.521 --> 02:13:39.690
<v Speaker 9>vegetarian and Vegan.</v>

4888
02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:42.510
<v Speaker 9>There's a guy named John Fitch that fought and this last UFC and he went,</v>

4889
02:13:42.511 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 9>he had a Vegan diet and I thought was really interesting.</v>

4890
02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:45.450
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to see how he,</v>

4891
02:13:45.451 --> 02:13:47.460
<v Speaker 9>did he want to win and you beat Bj Penn?</v>

4892
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.001
<v Speaker 9>It was sort of,</v>

4893
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:48.181
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

4894
02:13:48.181 --> 02:13:49.500
<v Speaker 9>I'm sorry it didn't beat Bj Penn.</v>

4895
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:50.573
<v Speaker 9>He was a draw,</v>

4896
02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:51.160
<v Speaker 9>but he won.</v>

4897
02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:53.520
<v Speaker 9>The final round is cardio was really good.</v>

4898
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:54.241
<v Speaker 9>It was really solid.</v>

4899
02:13:54.241 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 9>He was talking to miles.</v>

4900
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:56.340
<v Speaker 9>Cardio is like off the charts now,</v>

4901
02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:56.881
<v Speaker 9>you know.</v>

4902
02:13:56.881 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 9>But the [inaudible] they just have to refight.</v>

4903
02:14:00.450 --> 02:14:01.230
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

4904
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 9>They have to decide now.</v>

4905
02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:04.140
<v Speaker 9>They have to figure out what the fuck to do,</v>

4906
02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:04.930
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4907
02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:05.520
<v Speaker 9>because uh,</v>

4908
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 9>this was for the number one contender spot and you know,</v>

4909
02:14:07.951 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 9>fish is still pushing,</v>

4910
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:09.151
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4911
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:10.200
<v Speaker 9>after the post fight interview,</v>

4912
02:14:10.201 --> 02:14:10.831
<v Speaker 9>his coach was like,</v>

4913
02:14:10.831 --> 02:14:11.131
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4914
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:12.410
<v Speaker 9>ask for a title shot ever been.</v>

4915
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.721
<v Speaker 9>And I'm like,</v>

4916
02:14:12.721 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 9>mom,</v>

4917
02:14:13.410 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 9>you can't ask for a title shot after you get off of a draw.</v>

4918
02:14:15.541 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 9>It's just like too tough to sell.</v>

4919
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:18.480
<v Speaker 9>What did you think was going on with that fight?</v>

4920
02:14:18.481 --> 02:14:21.600
<v Speaker 9>Who Do you think draw could be a expected?</v>

4921
02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 9>Depends on how you score.</v>

4922
02:14:22.531 --> 02:14:23.180
<v Speaker 9>The third round,</v>

4923
02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:26.820
<v Speaker 9>the third round was pretty decisive victory for Fitch and some people thought</v>

4924
02:14:26.821 --> 02:14:27.780
<v Speaker 9>that was a ten eight round.</v>

4925
02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:28.151
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

4926
02:14:28.151 --> 02:14:29.040
<v Speaker 9>I'm not really,</v>

4927
02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:33.000
<v Speaker 9>it depends on how you use ten eight rounds because I the the ten eight round,</v>

4928
02:14:33.001 --> 02:14:34.020
<v Speaker 9>the system that they use now,</v>

4929
02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:36.360
<v Speaker 9>I think it's like they don't give out enough ten eight rounds,</v>

4930
02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:39.050
<v Speaker 9>but you have to decide when is it a ten eight round when you're inside a guys</v>

4931
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:41.430
<v Speaker 9>guard and he just punched him to the body into the head.</v>

4932
02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:42.960
<v Speaker 9>I'm not sure if that's a ten eight round.</v>

4933
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.830
<v Speaker 9>I could see it argued.</v>

4934
02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:44.641
<v Speaker 9>But Bj,</v>

4935
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:46.660
<v Speaker 9>I thought one the first two rounds because then,</v>

4936
02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 9>but those were very close to,</v>

4937
02:14:47.941 --> 02:14:50.080
<v Speaker 9>I could see it argued that pitched it to um,</v>

4938
02:14:50.690 --> 02:14:51.151
<v Speaker 9>Fitch one,</v>

4939
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:52.410
<v Speaker 9>one of them because um,</v>

4940
02:14:52.530 --> 02:14:52.861
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4941
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:53.850
<v Speaker 9>Bj got his back,</v>

4942
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:54.690
<v Speaker 9>PJ took them down,</v>

4943
02:14:54.691 --> 02:14:55.441
<v Speaker 9>Bj got us back,</v>

4944
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:57.450
<v Speaker 9>but then he lost position and Fitch got on top of them.</v>

4945
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:59.080
<v Speaker 9>So the question is like,</v>

4946
02:14:59.130 --> 02:14:59.311
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

4947
02:14:59.311 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 9>what is,</v>

4948
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:00.900
<v Speaker 9>what's worth more?</v>

4949
02:15:00.901 --> 02:15:03.870
<v Speaker 9>Is it worth more to take a guy down and to get a dominant position where you're</v>

4950
02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:07.260
<v Speaker 9>close to finishing a fight but then losing it and getting reversed and wind up</v>

4951
02:15:07.261 --> 02:15:09.810
<v Speaker 9>being your guard with the guy on top of you throwing punches.</v>

4952
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:13.200
<v Speaker 9>Is that better or is it better to take the guy's back?</v>

4953
02:15:13.201 --> 02:15:14.430
<v Speaker 9>What's worth more on points?</v>

4954
02:15:14.431 --> 02:15:14.521
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4955
02:15:14.521 --> 02:15:15.600
<v Speaker 9>that's a subjective thing,</v>

4956
02:15:15.601 --> 02:15:15.721
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4957
02:15:15.721 --> 02:15:16.554
<v Speaker 9>so it's tricky.</v>

4958
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 9>I could see that.</v>

4959
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:20.520
<v Speaker 9>I could see the first two rounds score for Bj and I could see,</v>

4960
02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:23.840
<v Speaker 9>I could see someone scoring one of them for Fitch and I can also see the,</v>

4961
02:15:23.841 --> 02:15:24.391
<v Speaker 9>the second,</v>

4962
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:27.240
<v Speaker 9>the third round rather being ten eight so I could see a draw.</v>

4963
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:29.070
<v Speaker 9>We were split two and when we were watching it,</v>

4964
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 9>watching it,</v>

4965
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 9>it's tricky man.</v>

4966
02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:31.260
<v Speaker 9>It's tricky.</v>

4967
02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.610
<v Speaker 9>Mean Bj is a bad motherfucker,</v>

4968
02:15:32.611 --> 02:15:33.040
<v Speaker 9>but he's,</v>

4969
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.560
<v Speaker 9>he's small for that weight class.</v>

4970
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:35.611
<v Speaker 9>You know when he's fighting,</v>

4971
02:15:35.611 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 9>he's weighing one 66 with his pants on and he's fighting Fitch who,</v>

4972
02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:40.460
<v Speaker 9>but this is the thing about Fitch.</v>

4973
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:41.400
<v Speaker 9>The reason why I brought this up,</v>

4974
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:42.480
<v Speaker 9>he was at one point in time,</v>

4975
02:15:42.481 --> 02:15:43.400
<v Speaker 9>like 200 pounds,</v>

4976
02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 9>he would cut down to one 70 but now he's like all organic and Vegan and he's</v>

4977
02:15:46.891 --> 02:15:51.030
<v Speaker 9>wearing around one 80 which is really light for him and then dropping a little</v>

4978
02:15:51.031 --> 02:15:53.040
<v Speaker 9>weight but it's cardio is like way better now too.</v>

4979
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:57.150
<v Speaker 9>I've entertained trying like a serious vegan diet for a while,</v>

4980
02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 9>but you know I heard like Travis Barker after he crashed in that plane and he</v>

4981
02:16:01.891 --> 02:16:03.480
<v Speaker 9>had to get skin grafts and shit like that.</v>

4982
02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:07.980
<v Speaker 9>They didn't take until he started eating meat and he like stopped being a Vegan</v>

4983
02:16:07.981 --> 02:16:09.740
<v Speaker 9>in his recovery from that again,</v>

4984
02:16:09.741 --> 02:16:10.080
<v Speaker 9>he was a,</v>

4985
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 9>he was a Vegan before that and then you know when he started eating red meat</v>

4986
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 9>then all of a sudden like his healing like went through the roof.</v>

4987
02:16:16.231 --> 02:16:19.890
<v Speaker 9>Whenever I eat vegan food and a Vegan restaurant,</v>

4988
02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:21.480
<v Speaker 9>I fucking love it.</v>

4989
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:22.553
<v Speaker 9>Swingers.</v>

4990
02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:24.450
<v Speaker 9>I could make this myself.</v>

4991
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:25.530
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't want to,</v>

4992
02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:26.360
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't care about,</v>

4993
02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:27.660
<v Speaker 9>well you could make it yourself easily.</v>

4994
02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:29.130
<v Speaker 9>It's a pain in the ass.</v>

4995
02:16:29.170 --> 02:16:29.900
<v Speaker 9>Pain in the ass.</v>

4996
02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 9>I</v>

4997
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.720
<v Speaker 4>could be wrong with our friend.</v>

4998
02:16:31.721 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 4>When when I dated her it was like having to go to certain restaurants having to</v>

4999
02:16:35.741 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 4>do all this bullshit.</v>

5000
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:38.620
<v Speaker 4>She's not even a Vegan anymore now.</v>

5001
02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5002
02:16:39.610 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 4>She eats Vegan here and there but she's,</v>

5003
02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:44.260
<v Speaker 4>she gets me just fucking filled with hormones right now.</v>

5004
02:16:44.261 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 4>Is it mostly just kidding?</v>

5005
02:16:45.570 --> 02:16:46.260
<v Speaker 9>Some meters?</v>

5006
02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:46.590
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5007
02:16:46.590 --> 02:16:46.950
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5008
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:48.090
<v Speaker 9>It depends on where you're getting it.</v>

5009
02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:48.641
<v Speaker 9>Free Range.</v>

5010
02:16:48.641 --> 02:16:49.321
<v Speaker 9>You want free range,</v>

5011
02:16:49.321 --> 02:16:51.570
<v Speaker 9>organic meat and that you want grass fed too.</v>

5012
02:16:51.571 --> 02:16:52.061
<v Speaker 9>I like gray.</v>

5013
02:16:52.061 --> 02:16:55.390
<v Speaker 9>I prefer the taste of grass fed is a discussion that Ari and I actually had on</v>

5014
02:16:55.391 --> 02:16:56.460
<v Speaker 9>the podcast on a plane.</v>

5015
02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:57.091
<v Speaker 9>The A,</v>

5016
02:16:57.091 --> 02:16:59.460
<v Speaker 9>the difference between grass fed and grain fed beef.</v>

5017
02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:00.450
<v Speaker 9>Beef is not,</v>

5018
02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:02.310
<v Speaker 9>it's not natural for them to beat and grain.</v>

5019
02:17:02.490 --> 02:17:03.570
<v Speaker 9>They're not supposed to eat corn.</v>

5020
02:17:03.690 --> 02:17:06.150
<v Speaker 9>We give them corn because it makes them fat as fuck,</v>

5021
02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:09.180
<v Speaker 9>which makes the meat so delicious and tender when you cook it because there's</v>

5022
02:17:09.181 --> 02:17:11.850
<v Speaker 9>all this fat bubbling up inside of it and you know,</v>

5023
02:17:11.851 --> 02:17:13.560
<v Speaker 9>and melting and it just gets awesome.</v>

5024
02:17:13.561 --> 02:17:16.470
<v Speaker 9>Like a big fat fucking grain fed steak.</v>

5025
02:17:16.471 --> 02:17:16.681
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5026
02:17:16.681 --> 02:17:18.510
<v Speaker 9>it's just so just melts in your mouth.</v>

5027
02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:21.150
<v Speaker 9>But the reality is they're supposed to be eating grass.</v>

5028
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.561
<v Speaker 9>And when you,</v>

5029
02:17:21.561 --> 02:17:23.220
<v Speaker 9>you taste grass fed beef,</v>

5030
02:17:23.221 --> 02:17:24.930
<v Speaker 9>it has a distinctly different flavor.</v>

5031
02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:25.913
<v Speaker 9>I prefer it,</v>

5032
02:17:26.550 --> 02:17:27.450
<v Speaker 9>but I like game.</v>

5033
02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:28.261
<v Speaker 9>I like eating.</v>

5034
02:17:28.261 --> 02:17:28.820
<v Speaker 9>Like I like,</v>

5035
02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:30.150
<v Speaker 9>I like venison and elk.</v>

5036
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:31.620
<v Speaker 9>I like eating like those meets,</v>

5037
02:17:31.621 --> 02:17:33.420
<v Speaker 9>I have my theories about that shit.</v>

5038
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:37.170
<v Speaker 9>I feel like anything that's tough to catch is easy or tough to catch,</v>

5039
02:17:37.171 --> 02:17:39.960
<v Speaker 9>whether is really good for you and things that are easy to catch.</v>

5040
02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:40.530
<v Speaker 9>Like cows,</v>

5041
02:17:40.530 --> 02:17:41.590
<v Speaker 9>you can just walk right up to account,</v>

5042
02:17:41.610 --> 02:17:42.690
<v Speaker 9>shoot him in the fucking head.</v>

5043
02:17:42.930 --> 02:17:43.763
<v Speaker 9>They're stupid.</v>

5044
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:44.370
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5045
02:17:44.370 --> 02:17:47.970
<v Speaker 9>like you'll shoot account ahead and a cow right next to him alert and he doesn't</v>

5046
02:17:47.971 --> 02:17:49.590
<v Speaker 9>even freak out and go holy fuck.</v>

5047
02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:51.150
<v Speaker 9>But like you try to shoot a pig,</v>

5048
02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.580
<v Speaker 9>pigs will run from you.</v>

5049
02:17:52.581 --> 02:17:52.950
<v Speaker 9>Man.</v>

5050

5067
02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:10.740
<v Speaker 4>you know like in India how like they worship cows.</v>

5068
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:15.180
<v Speaker 4>So in India like in the streets or these cows that have just been being petted</v>

5069
02:18:15.181 --> 02:18:17.010
<v Speaker 4>by people like dogs,</v>

<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5074
02:18:20.630 --> 02:18:25.260
<v Speaker 9>that docile behavior has been engineered through three years of breeding for,</v>

5075
02:18:25.470 --> 02:18:26.281
<v Speaker 9>for them to be,</v>

5076
02:18:26.281 --> 02:18:26.491
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5077
02:18:26.491 --> 02:18:30.960
<v Speaker 9>farm animals for them to be used while be so unnatural thing for people to just</v>

5078
02:18:30.961 --> 02:18:32.790
<v Speaker 9>walk right up to an animal and be able to pet it.</v>

5079
02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.170

<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

5081
02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:37.770
<v Speaker 9>I mean you have to engineer an animal to be that docile,</v>

5082
02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:38.131
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5083

02:18:44.371 --> 02:18:45.540
<v Speaker 9>They don't have that sort of,</v>

5087
02:18:45.541 --> 02:18:46.950
<v Speaker 9>I mean there's other wild cows.</v>

02:18:52.651 --> 02:18:53.640
<v Speaker 9>Very few of them are wild,</v>

5093
02:18:53.650 --> 02:18:54.210
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

5094
02:18:54.210 --> 02:18:54.481
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5095
02:18:54.481 --> 02:18:54.870
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5096
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Catherine valuable.</v>

5097
02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:56.550

5098
02:18:56.551 --> 02:18:58.860
<v Speaker 4>is there like weight or styles are very valuable,</v>

5099
02:18:58.910 --> 02:19:00.900
<v Speaker 4>really a lot of money that's worth a lot of money.</v>

5100
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.351
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

5101
02:19:01.351 --> 02:19:01.570
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5102
02:19:01.570 --> 02:19:04.140
<v Speaker 4>steak cows are a dime a dozen much.</v>

5103
02:19:04.141 --> 02:19:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Would it cost to buy a cow?</v>

5104
02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:06.360
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

5105
02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.193
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5106
02:19:07.290 --> 02:19:07.861
<v Speaker 4>Look it up,</v>

5107
02:19:07.861 --> 02:19:08.370
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5108
02:19:08.370 --> 02:19:09.031
<v Speaker 9>Love to do that,</v>

5109
02:19:09.031 --> 02:19:09.211
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

5110
02:19:09.211 --> 02:19:12.870
<v Speaker 9>I would love to have my own farm someday and just have animals that you know,</v>

5111
02:19:12.871 --> 02:19:14.220
<v Speaker 9>you know what they're feeding.</v>

5112
02:19:14.250 --> 02:19:15.120
<v Speaker 9>You know what you're feeding them,</v>

5113
02:19:15.121 --> 02:19:15.420
<v Speaker 9>rather,</v>

5114
02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:16.890
<v Speaker 9>you know if you're going to eat them,</v>

5115
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:18.330
<v Speaker 9>you know how they're treated.</v>

5116
02:19:18.331 --> 02:19:19.440
<v Speaker 9>You know that it's all humane</v>

5117
02:19:19.770 --> 02:19:19.980
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

5118
02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I think about that.</v>

5119
02:19:21.001 --> 02:19:21.330
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

5120
02:19:21.330 --> 02:19:23.250
<v Speaker 4>that my dream idea of that,</v>

5121
02:19:23.251 --> 02:19:28.251
<v Speaker 4>which is like this crazy plays out in the woods with solar panels</v>

5122
02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>where where the majority of your electricity or all of it is coming from the sun</v>

5123
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and you're feeding yourself from this place that's feasible here.</v>

5124
02:19:36.470 --> 02:19:36.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5125
02:19:36.711 --> 02:19:37.371
<v Speaker 1>it's feasible,</v>

5126
02:19:37.371 --> 02:19:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's like so like so much work to run a farm.</v>

5127
02:19:41.061 --> 02:19:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

5128
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not like either or either you have like people working for you and doing it</v>

5129
02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 1>or if you're involved in it,</v>

5130
02:19:48.801 --> 02:19:49.161
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

5131
02:19:49.161 --> 02:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>there's no stairs.</v>

5132
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You just work all day and sleep and you wake up and work all day and sleep.</v>

5133
02:19:53.250 --> 02:19:53.640
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

5134
02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:53.880
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

5135
02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:54.181
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

5136
02:19:54.181 --> 02:19:54.780
<v Speaker 9>you bud.</v>

5137
02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.920
<v Speaker 9>You can be self sustaining,</v>

5138
02:19:55.921 --> 02:19:56.581
<v Speaker 9>which is very,</v>

5139
02:19:56.581 --> 02:19:56.791
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5140
02:19:56.791 --> 02:19:57.850
<v Speaker 9>rewarding for a lot of pieces.</v>

5141
02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:58.160
<v Speaker 9>That idea.</v>

5142
02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:59.580
<v Speaker 9>Ideally you grow all your own food,</v>

5143
02:19:59.581 --> 02:20:02.340
<v Speaker 9>grow your own vegetables and you grow your own animals as well.</v>

5144
02:20:02.670 --> 02:20:03.091
<v Speaker 9>But yeah,</v>

5145
02:20:03.091 --> 02:20:04.470
<v Speaker 9>you could hire a few people to,</v>

5146
02:20:04.471 --> 02:20:07.440
<v Speaker 9>to run at me if you just wanted a farm only for your families.</v>

5147
02:20:07.470 --> 02:20:08.303
<v Speaker 9>Sustenance.</v>

5148
02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:08.791
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5149
02:20:08.791 --> 02:20:10.290
<v Speaker 9>that's kind of an interesting theory.</v>

5150
02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:10.680
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5151
02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:11.650
<v Speaker 9>an interesting sort of a,</v>

5152
02:20:11.651 --> 02:20:12.660
<v Speaker 9>a concept,</v>

5153
02:20:12.661 --> 02:20:12.901
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5154
02:20:12.901 --> 02:20:16.620
<v Speaker 9>set up a farm where all the vegetables that you grow or vegetables that you eat</v>

5155
02:20:16.621 --> 02:20:19.770
<v Speaker 9>and then I guess you know in the wintertime you can them or something or you</v>

5156
02:20:19.771 --> 02:20:21.840
<v Speaker 9>have a greenhouse or something you can't know.</v>

5157
02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Cows are about a thousand bucks,</v>

5158
02:20:23.730 --> 02:20:24.730
<v Speaker 1>1000 bucks for a cow.</v>

5159
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5160
02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:27.910
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bargain and what all the meat on that thing,</v>

5161
02:20:27.911 --> 02:20:32.550
<v Speaker 1>either by two cows or buy the new Mac book out fucking new Mac book all the way</v>

5162
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you guys lose and on this cause you guys are fucking goofy.</v>

5163
02:20:36.541 --> 02:20:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Mac heads as our mind iPad two and two days.</v>

5164
02:20:39.690 --> 02:20:41.610
<v Speaker 1>What is the nude was the deal with these Mac books?</v>

5165
02:20:41.611 --> 02:20:42.444
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5166
02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:44.130
<v Speaker 1>they look amazing.</v>

5167
02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5168
02:20:44.410 --> 02:20:46.040
<v Speaker 1>the biggest thing is the new technology,</v>

5169
02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>the thunderbolt technology,</v>

5170
02:20:47.221 --> 02:20:50.760
<v Speaker 1>which is like 10 gigabytes per second.</v>

5171
02:20:50.761 --> 02:20:51.594
<v Speaker 1>The ball.</v>

5172
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>This is a phone call,</v>

5173
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:52.990
<v Speaker 1>the thunderbolt two,</v>

5174
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:53.310
<v Speaker 1>the child,</v>

5175
02:20:53.310 --> 02:20:54.143
<v Speaker 1>now that</v>

5176
02:20:56.250 --> 02:20:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's 10 gigabytes per second.</v>

5177
02:20:57.751 --> 02:21:00.960
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is live like you're pretty much going to be able to hook up</v>

5178
02:21:00.961 --> 02:21:05.961
<v Speaker 1>an external hard drive and edit HD video easily and run multiple streams of,</v>

5179
02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:06.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5180
02:21:06.631 --> 02:21:10.530
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help editing video editing and transferring files nowadays when</v>

5181
02:21:10.531 --> 02:21:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you went to backup your computer 10 gigabytes a second,</v>

5182
02:21:13.141 --> 02:21:13.860
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

5183
02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:14.460
<v Speaker 1>That's credible.</v>

5184
02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:15.293
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

5185
02:21:15.810 --> 02:21:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And it has HD video cameras now.</v>

5186
02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Also bigger solid state drive you can get up to,</v>

5187
02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:20.821
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

5188
02:21:20.821 --> 02:21:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Everybody 50 thank you.</v>

5189
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Got sponsored by Mack.</v>

5190
02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5191
02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:26.240
<v Speaker 1>well they already do.</v>

5192
02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We use laptops that have the big apple logo on.</v>

5193
02:21:29.521 --> 02:21:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the [inaudible] tried to sponsor us.</v>

5194
02:21:31.711 --> 02:21:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like asking like this apple boom,</v>

5195
02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you guys drove up a lot.</v>

5196
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I wish apple please sponsor us.</v>

5197
02:21:36.841 --> 02:21:38.220
<v Speaker 1>But it was like quad cores.</v>

5198
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:42.690
<v Speaker 1>That's 50 times faster than the last last bit of Mac books.</v>

5199
02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:43.620
<v Speaker 1>50 Times.</v>

5200
02:21:43.621 --> 02:21:43.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5201
02:21:43.771 --> 02:21:47.490
<v Speaker 1>And some of the early benchmarks are showing anywhere from the 13 inch model</v>

5202
02:21:47.491 --> 02:21:49.110
<v Speaker 1>being about 12% faster.</v>

5203
02:21:49.111 --> 02:21:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Two to up to 53% faster.</v>

5204
02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5205
02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:52.381
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

5206
02:21:52.381 --> 02:21:54.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not 50 times.</v>

5207
02:21:54.490 --> 02:21:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

5208
02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:56.910
<v Speaker 1>50% 50% percent.</v>

5209
02:21:56.911 --> 02:21:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

5210
02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

5211
02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.673
<v Speaker 1>Quad Core,</v>

5212
02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:00.930
<v Speaker 1>double core quad core.</v>

5213
02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.800
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting.</v>

5214
02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So that would be what you would need if you were doing video rendering and shit</v>

5215
02:22:05.161 --> 02:22:05.521
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

5216
02:22:05.521 --> 02:22:06.301
<v Speaker 1>But for most people,</v>

5217
02:22:06.301 --> 02:22:07.020
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

5218
02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It was just a matter of transferring even,</v>

5219
02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:10.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5220
02:22:10.141 --> 02:22:10.921
<v Speaker 1>have you noticed even,</v>

5221
02:22:10.921 --> 02:22:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know on your laptop,</v>

5222
02:22:11.881 --> 02:22:15.690
<v Speaker 1>but I know that this one like fucking youtube or youtube videos or any kind of</v>

5223
02:22:15.691 --> 02:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>HD video still is struggling.</v>

5224
02:22:17.671 --> 02:22:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Even though this is a pretty fast laptop,</v>

5225
02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:20.680
<v Speaker 1>it's still struggles.</v>

5226
02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So the graphics card,</v>

5227
02:22:21.661 --> 02:22:21.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5228
02:22:21.930 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's mostly the graphics card and in just the fucking flash and</v>

5229
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:30.210
<v Speaker 4>the video card that needs new ones have video cards up to one gigabyte now,</v>

5230
02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.110
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy.</v>

5231
02:22:31.111 --> 02:22:32.550
<v Speaker 4>And the switch from the video,</v>

5232
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.460
<v Speaker 4>which has been having a lot of problems with the Mac books lately,</v>

5233
02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:35.971
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5234
02:22:35.971 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 4>with an overheating and problems with them.</v>

5235
02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Now they switched back to a,</v>

5236
02:22:39.850 --> 02:22:40.683
<v Speaker 4>a AMD or,</v>

5237
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:41.190
<v Speaker 9>or whatever.</v>

5238
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:44.790
<v Speaker 9>So this is interesting to me is exciting but not that exciting.</v>

5239
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:45.960
<v Speaker 9>I need some new shit.</v>

5240
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.291
<v Speaker 9>I need,</v>

5241
02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:47.550
<v Speaker 9>I need some next level shit.</v>

5242
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:50.490
<v Speaker 9>This transferring gigabytes real quick.</v>

5243
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:51.660
<v Speaker 9>That's all good and everything like that.</v>

5244
02:22:51.661 --> 02:22:54.450
<v Speaker 9>But what is the next thing that a fucking computer's going to do that's really</v>

5245
02:22:54.451 --> 02:22:55.290
<v Speaker 9>going to blow you away?</v>

5246
02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:56.430
<v Speaker 9>That's going to do that?</v>

5247
02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:59.210
<v Speaker 9>I think if we're going more towards tablet more for Jackson,</v>

5248
02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:00.090
<v Speaker 9>quantum computing,</v>

5249
02:23:00.090 --> 02:23:00.250
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

5250
02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:01.110
<v Speaker 9>it's that fucking,</v>

5251
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:01.800
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

5252
02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.800
<v Speaker 9>the computer that just beat people at jeopardy.</v>

5253
02:23:04.801 --> 02:23:05.634
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

5254
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:06.121
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

5255
02:23:06.121 --> 02:23:06.954
<v Speaker 9>seriously.</v>

5256
02:23:07.050 --> 02:23:07.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5257
02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:11.700
<v Speaker 4>it used to be like a computer that could play chess and beat people was a big</v>

5258
02:23:11.701 --> 02:23:12.450
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>

5259
02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Now everyone has a computer that can be you at chess,</v>

5260
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:15.281
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5261
02:23:15.281 --> 02:23:15.841
<v Speaker 4>Eventually.</v>

5262
02:23:15.841 --> 02:23:20.220
<v Speaker 4>Like the next thing you're talking about is like interactive surfaces where you</v>

5263
02:23:20.221 --> 02:23:21.870
<v Speaker 4>tell it exactly what you want.</v>

5264
02:23:21.871 --> 02:23:25.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually more excited about this iPad to announcement March 2nd which is</v>

5265
02:23:25.231 --> 02:23:28.490
<v Speaker 4>supposedly going to have cameras in the front and back pretty soon.</v>

5266
02:23:28.491 --> 02:23:31.650
<v Speaker 4>That's going to change the whole thing with being able to do facetime and</v>

5267
02:23:31.651 --> 02:23:32.580
<v Speaker 4>watching you stream.</v>

5268
02:23:32.581 --> 02:23:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Now you can be able to use string from your team.</v>

5269
02:23:33.970 --> 02:23:34.360
<v Speaker 9>Hi Pat,</v>

5270
02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:34.810
<v Speaker 9>this is,</v>

5271
02:23:34.810 --> 02:23:37.390
<v Speaker 9>this is what's really trippy quantum computing.</v>

5272
02:23:37.570 --> 02:23:41.860
<v Speaker 9>That's the really weird shit because first of all try to wrap your head around</v>

5273
02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.380
<v Speaker 9>what a quantum computer really is.</v>

5274
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:48.190
<v Speaker 9>You have to really kind of understand what the idea behind quantum mechanics and</v>

5275
02:23:48.430 --> 02:23:49.690
<v Speaker 9>what it basically is is a,</v>

5276
02:23:49.691 --> 02:23:51.820
<v Speaker 9>this is how it's listed in Wikipedia.</v>

5277
02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:55.900
<v Speaker 9>A device for computation that makes direct use of quantum mechanical phenomena</v>

5278
02:23:55.901 --> 02:23:58.360
<v Speaker 9>such as super position and entanglement.</v>

5279
02:23:58.570 --> 02:23:59.470
<v Speaker 9>And if you don't know what that means,</v>

5280
02:23:59.471 --> 02:24:03.490
<v Speaker 9>superposition means that an object can be both moving and still at the same</v>

5281
02:24:03.491 --> 02:24:04.120
<v Speaker 9>time.</v>

5282
02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:04.670
<v Speaker 9>I mean the,</v>

5283
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:05.180
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5284
02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:09.190
<v Speaker 9>the idea of quantum mechanics you get into like that's weird Voodoo Shit.</v>

5285
02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:13.300
<v Speaker 9>Things that particles that subatomic particles at blink in and out of existence</v>

5286
02:24:13.301 --> 02:24:14.230
<v Speaker 9>and the idea of,</v>

5287
02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:14.591
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5288
02:24:14.591 --> 02:24:16.630
<v Speaker 9>it being able to be effected by the user.</v>

5289
02:24:16.631 --> 02:24:18.400
<v Speaker 9>I mean those are all quantum mechanical ideas,</v>

5290
02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.640
<v Speaker 4>quantum entanglement because that really is Voodoo shit that's like,</v>

5291
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:27.410
<v Speaker 4>that's a computer quantum entanglement is as I understand it,</v>

5292
02:24:27.411 --> 02:24:31.310
<v Speaker 4>is the idea that if you take two particles and put them together and then move</v>

5293
02:24:31.311 --> 02:24:32.144
<v Speaker 4>them apart,</v>

5294
02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:32.541
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5295
02:24:32.541 --> 02:24:36.770
<v Speaker 4>They still are somehow connected and you can transfer information down that</v>

5296
02:24:36.771 --> 02:24:37.210
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

5297
02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:38.800
<v Speaker 9>It's one of those things where I talk about it.</v>

5298
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:40.960
<v Speaker 9>I say what I've heard said,</v>

5299
02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:43.210
<v Speaker 9>but I don't know what it means.</v>

5300
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.460
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5301
02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:43.931
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

5302
02:24:43.931 --> 02:24:46.870
<v Speaker 9>Like I'm talking about super positions and I'm talking about entanglement and</v>

5303
02:24:46.871 --> 02:24:47.860
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying all those things,</v>

5304
02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:48.770
<v Speaker 9>but I mean what,</v>

5305
02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:49.090
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>

5306
02:24:49.090 --> 02:24:49.720
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5307
02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:52.270
<v Speaker 9>all I'm doing is making the right noises with my mouth.</v>

5308
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:53.140
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5309
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:57.000
<v Speaker 9>my brain barely makes the connection to what the fuck that screw the mind.</v>

5310
02:24:57.001 --> 02:24:57.380
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5311
02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Connection is just this rudimentary thing where I think of like to round things</v>

5312
02:25:01.671 --> 02:25:05.660
<v Speaker 4>that have what appear to be a really long hair attaching them or something.</v>

5313
02:25:05.661 --> 02:25:09.890
<v Speaker 4>Like when you like the idea that you did things just kind of like have some</v>

5314
02:25:09.891 --> 02:25:12.140
<v Speaker 4>invisible or tiny uh,</v>

5315
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:14.480
<v Speaker 4>relationship that just stretches apart.</v>

5316
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:15.200
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

5317
02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.030
<v Speaker 4>the reason I say that it's Voodoo or witchcraft is cause it's like Rosemary's</v>

5318
02:25:20.031 --> 02:25:22.940
<v Speaker 4>baby who remember the guy called and he was missing his,</v>

5319
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

5320
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.080
<v Speaker 6>one of the things which is are always trying to do is deal a little piece of you</v>

5321
02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.160
<v Speaker 6>get your hair and quantum entanglements.</v>

5322
02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

5323
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 6>Then that would mean that there's some connection between you and the thing that</v>

5324
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:33.940
<v Speaker 6>came from you did,</v>

5325
02:25:33.941 --> 02:25:36.580
<v Speaker 6>they could start shooting bad energy down that line.</v>

5326
02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:37.780
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

5327
02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit</v>

5328
02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:41.583
<v Speaker 6>Real.</v>

5329
02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:43.300
<v Speaker 6>They just didn't have the words for it.</v>

5330
02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:45.260
<v Speaker 9>I always thought about Alchemy,</v>

5331
02:25:45.261 --> 02:25:46.670
<v Speaker 9>like the idea of alchemy.</v>

5332
02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:47.211
<v Speaker 9>Like what,</v>

5333
02:25:47.211 --> 02:25:50.930
<v Speaker 9>you know when people are trying to make gold at a lead and using magic and all</v>

5334
02:25:50.931 --> 02:25:51.711
<v Speaker 9>sorts of different things,</v>

5335
02:25:51.711 --> 02:25:52.820
<v Speaker 9>like where is it?</v>

5336
02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:53.660
<v Speaker 9>What's,</v>

5337
02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:54.493
<v Speaker 9>what's that?</v>

5338
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:55.040
<v Speaker 9>Is that,</v>

5339
02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:55.520
<v Speaker 9>is that,</v>

5340
02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.353
<v Speaker 9>I mean if,</v>

5341
02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.890
<v Speaker 9>if we really do break down things as far as their elemental structure and we</v>

5342
02:26:00.891 --> 02:26:01.251
<v Speaker 9>really under,</v>

5343
02:26:01.251 --> 02:26:03.950
<v Speaker 9>is it possible to turn lead into gold Sunday?</v>

5344
02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.230
<v Speaker 9>Is someone going to be able to adjust,</v>

5345
02:26:06.330 --> 02:26:06.651
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5346
02:26:06.651 --> 02:26:06.951
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>

5347
02:26:06.951 --> 02:26:07.530
<v Speaker 9>what the,</v>

5348
02:26:07.530 --> 02:26:11.390
<v Speaker 9>the molecules that the differentiate between gold and lead and platinum and</v>

5349
02:26:11.391 --> 02:26:11.750
<v Speaker 9>silver,</v>

5350
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:12.583
<v Speaker 9>is that possible?</v>

5351
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:13.643
<v Speaker 9>Or you can do it.</v>

5352
02:26:13.850 --> 02:26:14.021
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5353
02:26:14.021 --> 02:26:15.650
<v Speaker 9>there are like the three d printers,</v>

5354
02:26:15.651 --> 02:26:16.790
<v Speaker 9>just sort of a diamonds.</v>

5355
02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:17.091
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

5356
02:26:17.091 --> 02:26:17.990
<v Speaker 9>that's like you're,</v>

5357
02:26:17.991 --> 02:26:21.710
<v Speaker 9>you're smashing something with intense pressure and creating a new thing with</v>

5358
02:26:21.711 --> 02:26:22.070
<v Speaker 9>it,</v>

5359
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:23.930
<v Speaker 9>but you're not turning something into something.</v>

5360
02:26:23.931 --> 02:26:24.560
<v Speaker 9>It's not,</v>

5361
02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.270
<v Speaker 9>it's like a natural sort of,</v>

5362
02:26:26.271 --> 02:26:26.440
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5363
02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:28.670
<v Speaker 9>men are mo fos metamorphoses right.</v>

5364
02:26:28.671 --> 02:26:29.480
<v Speaker 9>Doesn't that make sense?</v>

5365
02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.140
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5366
02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:30.800
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

5367
02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 9>because we know like what the,</v>

5368
02:26:31.991 --> 02:26:34.190
<v Speaker 9>the chain reaction that causes diamonds,</v>

5369
02:26:34.191 --> 02:26:38.390
<v Speaker 9>we or the chemical reaction that pressure and carbon and millions of years or</v>

5370
02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:38.750
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5371
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:41.540
<v Speaker 9>some crazy fucking thing that the Russians event that makes diamonds out of</v>

5372
02:26:41.541 --> 02:26:41.970
<v Speaker 9>nothing.</v>

5373
02:26:41.970 --> 02:26:42.121
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5374
02:26:42.121 --> 02:26:43.560
<v Speaker 6>have you ever heard the idea that coal,</v>

5375
02:26:43.770 --> 02:26:45.600
<v Speaker 6>that alchemy was</v>

5376
02:26:47.310 --> 02:26:50.940
<v Speaker 6>code for a secret society that was trying to teach people to become enlightened</v>

5377
02:26:50.941 --> 02:26:52.740
<v Speaker 6>through science and that the idea,</v>

5378
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:53.371
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5379
02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.450
<v Speaker 6>lead into gold,</v>

5380
02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:56.910
<v Speaker 6>the ID of the transmutation of lead into gold.</v>

5381
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:58.170
<v Speaker 6>They didn't really,</v>

5382
02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:01.080
<v Speaker 6>even though that it was a focus of alchemy,</v>

5383
02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:02.490
<v Speaker 6>there was a deeper level,</v>

5384
02:27:02.491 --> 02:27:05.910
<v Speaker 6>which is the idea that they're talking about the transformation of the human</v>

5385
02:27:05.911 --> 02:27:09.060
<v Speaker 6>consciousness from going to a useless,</v>

5386
02:27:09.090 --> 02:27:12.720
<v Speaker 6>empty robotic state to a fully realized,</v>

5387
02:27:12.721 --> 02:27:13.640
<v Speaker 6>say like,</v>

5388

<v Speaker 6>The guy who drowned himself in the bathtub,</v>

5481
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:25.610
<v Speaker 6>we'll come up with [inaudible] and that was just a long time ago.</v>

5482
02:29:25.611 --> 02:29:27.770
<v Speaker 6>That was when I worked at the comedy store.</v>

5483
02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:30.140
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember when you worked at the comedy store and we used to,</v>

5484
02:29:30.141 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 6>I used to call you up and we'd have long ass fucking crazy conversations while</v>

5485
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:34.574
<v Speaker 6>you were working there.</v>

5486
02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 6>That's how he got to be friends.</v>

5487
02:29:36.450 --> 02:29:37.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5488
02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:37.520
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5489
02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.790
<v Speaker 6>I used to know Dunkin from Dunkin hanging out there and then Dunkin started</v>

5490
02:29:40.791 --> 02:29:45.050
<v Speaker 6>working for the store and I would call up and dug it and I would have long</v>

5491
02:29:45.051 --> 02:29:48.680
<v Speaker 6>fucking bizarre conversations that would last for hours.</v>

5492
02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:49.460
<v Speaker 6>While you were,</v>

5493
02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:50.360
<v Speaker 6>while you were working.</v>

5494
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:54.260
<v Speaker 6>Pretty much this would happen over the phone and dunking.</v>

5495
02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:59.330
<v Speaker 6>Here's proof that Dunkin practices what he preaches when he was working at the</v>

5496
02:29:59.331 --> 02:29:59.871
<v Speaker 6>comedy store.</v>

5497
02:29:59.871 --> 02:30:04.310
<v Speaker 6>That's when the Pauly shore reality show came around and everybody else went</v>

5498
02:30:04.311 --> 02:30:05.510
<v Speaker 6>along with it and is like,</v>

02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:07.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be a part of this and you quit.</v>

5501
02:30:07.970 --> 02:30:08.640
<v Speaker 6>I quit.</v>

5502
02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:09.800
<v Speaker 6>And you didn't have an option.</v>

5503
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to be on that show.</v>

5504
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.901
<v Speaker 6>Well man,</v>

<v Speaker 6>what started happening is like,</v>

5507
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.691

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5511
02:30:20.241 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 6>and then the show started happening for real and all of a sudden I couldn't</v>

5512
02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:27.290
<v Speaker 6>sleep at night and I was grinding my teeth.</v>

5513
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:31.520
<v Speaker 6>Cause the idea of having to be on this reality show and like I was,</v>

5514
02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:32.600
<v Speaker 6>I would wake up and I,</v>

5515
02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:34.940
<v Speaker 6>my teeth grinding and I'd be like,</v>

5522
02:30:41.061 --> 02:30:42.440
<v Speaker 6>cause I didn't know at the time I was like,</v>

5531
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:56.360
<v Speaker 6>Answering the phone from Mitzi was just like the most humiliating.</v>

5532
02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:59.120
<v Speaker 6>It would have been the worst thing ever.</v>

5533
02:30:59.140 --> 02:30:59.973
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5534
02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:01.670
<v Speaker 6>That was cool that he did.</v>

5535
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:02.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5536
02:31:02.001 --> 02:31:02.661
<v Speaker 6>You've really,</v>

5537
02:31:02.661 --> 02:31:02.960
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5538
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:04.070
<v Speaker 6>you really like,</v>

5539
02:31:04.430 --> 02:31:04.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5540
02:31:04.701 --> 02:31:04.841
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

5541
02:31:04.841 --> 02:31:06.320
<v Speaker 6>you had a reaction to it.</v>

5542
02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:08.210
<v Speaker 6>A very strong reaction,</v>

5543
02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.970
<v Speaker 6>which a lot of people wouldn't because this is an opportunity for you to get on</v>

5544
02:31:10.971 --> 02:31:11.580
<v Speaker 6>television,</v>

5545
02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:12.260
<v Speaker 6>on TV.</v>

5546
02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:12.771
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

5547
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 6>I got to get on TV.</v>

5548
02:31:13.851 --> 02:31:15.650
<v Speaker 6>I just got to get in front of those cameras at all.</v>

5549
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:17.750
<v Speaker 6>Do you think you could have done for your factor?</v>

5550
02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:19.040
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>

5551
02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 6>If someone came up to</v>

5552
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:20.371
<v Speaker 9>you and said,</v>

5553
02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:20.941
<v Speaker 9>Hey Dunkin,</v>

5554
02:31:20.941 --> 02:31:21.774
<v Speaker 9>we have this show,</v>

5555
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 9>we want you to host fear factor.</v>

5556
02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:24.780
<v Speaker 9>It's going to be this network,</v>

5557
02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:26.130
<v Speaker 9>a reality show.</v>

5558
02:31:26.131 --> 02:31:26.400
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5559
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:26.980
<v Speaker 9>I don't think,</v>

5560
02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:28.110
<v Speaker 9>I don't think that would have been your,</v>

5561
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 9>I know you might not have done it.</v>

5562
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:30.901
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>

5563
02:31:30.901 --> 02:31:31.920
<v Speaker 9>you're a weird dude man.</v>

5564
02:31:31.921 --> 02:31:32.940
<v Speaker 9>You might have walked away from me.</v>

5565
02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:34.650
<v Speaker 6>Blame the difference between,</v>

5566
02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:35.281
<v Speaker 6>and by the way,</v>

5567
02:31:35.281 --> 02:31:40.281
<v Speaker 6>cause I do not want to come off like I'm some kind of like a saint or self</v>

5568
02:31:40.621 --> 02:31:41.071
<v Speaker 6>righteous,</v>

5569
02:31:41.071 --> 02:31:42.880
<v Speaker 6>like super like my art.</v>

5570
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:43.710
<v Speaker 9>What does it take?</v>

5571
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:43.910
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

5572
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:46.250
<v Speaker 9>It wasn't just any reality show by the way.</v>

5573
02:31:46.251 --> 02:31:51.251
<v Speaker 9>You had worked there and saw the toxic environment dealing with for a long time</v>

5574
02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:56.420
<v Speaker 9>and then saw that the most toxic of all was in control of this,</v>

5575
02:31:56.540 --> 02:32:00.050
<v Speaker 9>this sort of project and it was going down all the wrong paths and you know,</v>

5576
02:32:00.051 --> 02:32:01.590
<v Speaker 9>you made it a conscious too,</v>

5577
02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:02.060
<v Speaker 6>Susan.</v>

5578
02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:04.460
<v Speaker 6>I needed a way the fuck out of that job.</v>

5579
02:32:04.461 --> 02:32:06.410
<v Speaker 6>It was a desk job and like yeah,</v>

5580
02:32:06.430 --> 02:32:06.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5581
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:08.390
<v Speaker 6>I needed to get the fuck out.</v>

5582
02:32:08.391 --> 02:32:09.224
<v Speaker 6>And it was just like,</v>

5583
02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:12.380
<v Speaker 6>it seemed like a lot of things were aligning at the same time.</v>

5584
02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:17.620
<v Speaker 6>They gave me a way to move on instead of a continuing in a,</v>

5585
02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:20.060
<v Speaker 6>in this job that,</v>

5586
02:32:20.210 --> 02:32:20.691
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

5587
02:32:20.691 --> 02:32:22.910
<v Speaker 6>it was like a job where I was tired of it.</v>

5588
02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:27.530
<v Speaker 6>The guy who's the current talent coordinator was obviously really into the idea</v>

5589
02:32:27.531 --> 02:32:28.670
<v Speaker 6>of having that job.</v>

5590
02:32:28.671 --> 02:32:29.421
<v Speaker 6>Like for him,</v>

5591
02:32:29.421 --> 02:32:30.830
<v Speaker 6>he wanted to do it,</v>

5592
02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:31.971
<v Speaker 6>whereas for me,</v>

5593
02:32:31.971 --> 02:32:32.804
<v Speaker 6>it was like,</v>

5594
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:36.230
<v Speaker 6>it had gotten to the point where I wasn't inspired by it and it was,</v>

5595
02:32:36.231 --> 02:32:41.231
<v Speaker 6>this seem like to continue on would be the ultimate hypocrisy and would be a</v>

5596
02:32:42.891 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 6>shitty move on</v>

5597
02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:44.800
<v Speaker 9>every single.</v>

5598
02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:46.990
<v Speaker 9>That's interesting because a lot of people would have never thought about that</v>

5599
02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:47.111
<v Speaker 9>way.</v>

5600
02:32:47.111 --> 02:32:47.740
<v Speaker 9>They would've thought,</v>

5601
02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:47.981
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

5602
02:32:47.981 --> 02:32:48.820
<v Speaker 9>here's an opportunity.</v>

5603
02:32:48.821 --> 02:32:49.090
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5604
02:32:49.090 --> 02:32:50.920
<v Speaker 9>honestly meet me personally,</v>

5605
02:32:50.921 --> 02:32:52.480
<v Speaker 9>I probably would have thought about it and said,</v>

5606
02:32:52.481 --> 02:32:53.190
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

5607
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.470
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5608
02:32:53.470 --> 02:32:54.221
<v Speaker 9>if I was working there,</v>

5609
02:32:54.221 --> 02:32:55.520
<v Speaker 9>at least I'll get on television,</v>

5610
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:56.950
<v Speaker 9>this will give me an opportunity to,</v>

5611
02:32:56.951 --> 02:32:57.221
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5612
02:32:57.221 --> 02:32:59.050
<v Speaker 9>maybe branch off and do other things,</v>

5613
02:32:59.051 --> 02:32:59.880
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

5614
02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:00.211
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5615
02:33:00.211 --> 02:33:00.451
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5616
02:33:00.451 --> 02:33:00.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5617
02:33:00.751 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5618
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:01.590
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

5619
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:04.740
<v Speaker 6>I've got a really like weird hang up,</v>

5620
02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:05.371
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5621
02:33:05.371 --> 02:33:07.080
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to performance,</v>

5622
02:33:07.081 --> 02:33:08.790
<v Speaker 6>which is that I think that people,</v>

5623
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:11.940
<v Speaker 6>if they're performing for something that's making money,</v>

5624
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:14.010
<v Speaker 6>deserve to get paid for it.</v>

5625
02:33:14.011 --> 02:33:17.670
<v Speaker 6>And so when I do our comedy show at the cemetery Thursday,</v>

5626
02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:18.211
<v Speaker 6>we pay,</v>

5627
02:33:18.211 --> 02:33:18.481
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

5628
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:19.314
<v Speaker 6>it's this Thursday.</v>

5629
02:33:19.410 --> 02:33:20.730
<v Speaker 6>We pay our comedians.</v>

5630
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:21.420
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5631
02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:25.170
<v Speaker 6>we pay everyone who performs and if I'm shooting something,</v>

5632
02:33:25.350 --> 02:33:26.700
<v Speaker 6>even if it's something that,</v>

5633
02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:27.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5634
02:33:27.250 --> 02:33:28.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm not getting paid for,</v>

5635
02:33:28.801 --> 02:33:31.650
<v Speaker 6>if someone comes in is in a sketch I come up with,</v>

5636
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 6>I pay them like I give them money because they drove out there and gave me their</v>

5637
02:33:35.611 --> 02:33:37.680
<v Speaker 6>time and they fucking deserve it.</v>

5638
02:33:37.681 --> 02:33:38.071
<v Speaker 6>Cause that's,</v>

5639
02:33:38.071 --> 02:33:41.280
<v Speaker 6>I believe that you should be compensated a for art.</v>

5640
02:33:41.310 --> 02:33:43.470
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's one of the highest things ever.</v>

5641
02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:48.060
<v Speaker 6>So another thing that was a little off putting about that show is that I was</v>

5642
02:33:48.061 --> 02:33:49.260
<v Speaker 6>clearly going to white,</v>

5643
02:33:49.261 --> 02:33:49.740
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

5644
02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:53.340
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't just like they were going to film me at my desk doing my job.</v>

5645
02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:57.270
<v Speaker 6>It was like they wanted to create a heightened reality.</v>

5646
02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:58.291
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

5647
02:33:58.291 --> 02:34:01.030
<v Speaker 6>Which one of you to fake shit and follow a script.</v>

5648
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.700
<v Speaker 6>So I brought,</v>

5649
02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:02.420
<v Speaker 6>it was a bad school,</v>

5650
02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:02.881
<v Speaker 6>so I said,</v>

5651
02:34:02.881 --> 02:34:03.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5652
02:34:03.390 --> 02:34:04.161
<v Speaker 6>well what?</v>

5653
02:34:04.161 --> 02:34:04.870
<v Speaker 6>What did well,</v>

5654
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:05.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm an eat for one.</v>

5655
02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:06.050
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

5656
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.721
<v Speaker 6>I was even then,</v>

5657
02:34:06.721 --> 02:34:07.321
<v Speaker 6>I was in a,</v>

5658
02:34:07.321 --> 02:34:09.510
<v Speaker 6>after I was in a actors' union.</v>

5659
02:34:09.511 --> 02:34:09.841
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

5660
02:34:09.841 --> 02:34:10.680
<v Speaker 6>so wait a minute,</v>

5661
02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:13.650
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to pay me for acting.</v>

5662
02:34:13.651 --> 02:34:14.100
<v Speaker 6>Don't like,</v>

5663
02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:16.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm you ha you have to like you,</v>

5664
02:34:16.291 --> 02:34:16.501
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

5665
02:34:16.501 --> 02:34:17.080
<v Speaker 6>I get caught.</v>

5666
02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:18.460
<v Speaker 6>I know that you're making money.</v>

5667
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:22.030
<v Speaker 6>Anyone who's acting in spending their time involved in this thing should be</v>

5668
02:34:22.031 --> 02:34:22.781
<v Speaker 6>getting paid.</v>

5669
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:23.950
<v Speaker 6>They should get a little piece,</v>

5670
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:25.300
<v Speaker 6>but then you weren't going to get paid.</v>

5671
02:34:25.330 --> 02:34:27.010
<v Speaker 6>The producer had said to me,</v>

5672
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.010
<v Speaker 6>absolutely not.</v>

5673
02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:31.600

<v Speaker 9>bunch of cunts.</v>

5697
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:58.490
<v Speaker 9>I did not know that at all.</v>

5698
02:34:58.520 --> 02:34:58.760
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

5699
02:34:58.760 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 9>so that would,</v>

5700
02:34:59.870 --> 02:35:00.351
<v Speaker 9>that is that,</v>

5701
02:35:00.351 --> 02:35:03.860
<v Speaker 9>does that surprise you given the toxic environment that we were talking about,</v>

5702
02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:04.694
<v Speaker 9>what you do,</v>

5703
02:35:04.730 --> 02:35:08.570
<v Speaker 9>how about a comics opening for him and not getting paid and all sorts of the</v>

5704
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:09.980
<v Speaker 9>Shit Day you're doing it for the store buddy?</v>

5705
02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:10.201
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5706
02:35:10.201 --> 02:35:10.441
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5707
02:35:10.441 --> 02:35:11.760
<v Speaker 6>that's the C and that's the,</v>

5708
02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:12.220
<v Speaker 6>the the,</v>

5709
02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:15.690
<v Speaker 6>the problem about that attitude,</v>

5710
02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:16.613
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5711
02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:20.010
<v Speaker 6>which is in so many different aspects of society,</v>

5712
02:35:20.011 --> 02:35:25.011
<v Speaker 6>which is where the artist is given the impression that they are lucky to be</v>

5713
02:35:26.551 --> 02:35:28.590
<v Speaker 6>doing there are in a certain place.</v>

5714
02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:29.070
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

5715
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:31.050
<v Speaker 6>That is fucking satanism.</v>

5716
02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:32.460
<v Speaker 6>That is not how it works,</v>

5717
02:35:32.461 --> 02:35:32.701
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5718
02:35:32.701 --> 02:35:35.380
<v Speaker 6>It's like I don't care what the fucking place is the are,</v>

5719
02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:38.970
<v Speaker 6>if it's a place that's making money and generating money off the artist,</v>

5720
02:35:38.971 --> 02:35:39.481
<v Speaker 6>the artist,</v>

5721
02:35:39.481 --> 02:35:41.580
<v Speaker 6>is it the top of the fucking pyramid,</v>

5722
02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:41.971
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

5723
02:35:41.971 --> 02:35:42.930
<v Speaker 6>Actually this logic,</v>

5724
02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.320
<v Speaker 6>if there's a fucking guy who makes beautiful cabinets,</v>

5725
02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.630
<v Speaker 6>the most beautiful cabinets in the world,</v>

5726
02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:50.550
<v Speaker 6>that guy is not going to be like,</v>

5727
02:35:50.551 --> 02:35:50.821
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5728
02:35:50.821 --> 02:35:55.821
<v Speaker 6>I am so lucky to be in this workshop where they let me make these cabinets.</v>

5729
02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:56.580
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5730
02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:56.771
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5731
02:35:56.771 --> 02:36:00.990
<v Speaker 9>the comedy store is the worst case example of a place that thinks it's the star,</v>

5732
02:36:01.350 --> 02:36:02.430
<v Speaker 9>the place that thinks it's,</v>

5733
02:36:02.431 --> 02:36:03.210
<v Speaker 9>what's it called?</v>

5734
02:36:03.210 --> 02:36:04.530
<v Speaker 6>Let me just say it's changed a lot.</v>

5735
02:36:04.531 --> 02:36:04.660
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

5736
02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:05.010
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5737
02:36:05.010 --> 02:36:05.843
<v Speaker 6>it has,</v>

5738
02:36:07.530 --> 02:36:09.690
<v Speaker 6>I have to stick up for the place because I,</v>

5739
02:36:09.691 --> 02:36:10.524
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5740
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:11.543
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5741
02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:12.161
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5742
02:36:12.161 --> 02:36:13.800
<v Speaker 6>but I go up there regularly and I,</v>

5743
02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:14.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5744
02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:16.200
<v Speaker 6>the climate is kind of took it back.</v>

5745
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:17.440
<v Speaker 6>Comics kind of take it back,</v>

5746
02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:19.290
<v Speaker 6>the place possible.</v>

5747
02:36:19.291 --> 02:36:19.711
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>

5748
02:36:19.711 --> 02:36:21.390
<v Speaker 6>the places on the Dean's still the manager.</v>

5749
02:36:21.430 --> 02:36:21.750

5751
02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:25.140

5752
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:27.630
<v Speaker 6>a geologic shift.</v>

5753
02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:29.850
<v Speaker 6>They're putting on really good acts right now.</v>

5754
02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.950
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking packed all the time.</v>

5755
02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:34.260
<v Speaker 6>It's got a really exciting,</v>

5756
02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:35.310
<v Speaker 6>good vibe there.</v>

5757
02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:40.320
<v Speaker 6>And that period of stagnation and weirdness that were new when with which made</v>

5758
02:36:40.321 --> 02:36:40.531
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

5759
02:36:40.531 --> 02:36:41.730
<v Speaker 6>which drove you out,</v>

5760
02:36:41.970 --> 02:36:42.900
<v Speaker 6>that's long gone.</v>

5766
02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:47.181
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5767
02:36:47.181 --> 02:36:47.630
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't,</v>

5768
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:48.380
<v Speaker 6>I changed it.</v>

5769
02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:50.180
<v Speaker 6>I just still welcome to go there.</v>

5770
02:36:50.181 --> 02:36:50.870

02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:53.020
<v Speaker 6>He can still go there and I don't know,</v>

5774
02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:53.771
<v Speaker 6>but it's only once.</v>

5775
02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:54.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

5776
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:56.630
<v Speaker 6>I think he has to call in now where he be getting,</v>

5777
02:36:56.930 --> 02:36:58.700
<v Speaker 6>I think Sarah Silverman just went up there.</v>

5778
02:36:58.701 --> 02:36:59.900
<v Speaker 6>She's there all the time.</v>

5779
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:02.000
<v Speaker 6>Chappelle's every time I go in there I'm like,</v>

5780
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:03.980
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

5781
02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:06.410
<v Speaker 6>It's generally just like burgeoning,</v>

5782
02:37:06.411 --> 02:37:07.460
<v Speaker 6>like you know what it seems like,</v>

5783
02:37:07.461 --> 02:37:10.660
<v Speaker 6>it seems like the management kind of took a step a couple steps back or that</v>

5784
02:37:10.661 --> 02:37:12.330
<v Speaker 6>they were told to or that,</v>

5785
02:37:12.331 --> 02:37:15.650
<v Speaker 6>that they just kind of got bored of trying to be because now seems like really</v>

5786
02:37:15.651 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 6>you just see</v>

5787
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:16.960
<v Speaker 7>the comics,</v>

5788
02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:17.793
<v Speaker 7>the comics are</v>

5789
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:18.620
<v Speaker 9>just all,</v>

5790
02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:20.010
<v Speaker 9>that's always best case scenario,</v>

5791
02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:20.450
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5792
02:37:20.450 --> 02:37:20.910
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

5793
02:37:20.910 --> 02:37:22.980
<v Speaker 9>this talk about people getting paid.</v>

5794
02:37:22.981 --> 02:37:25.230
<v Speaker 9>Here's another interesting topic that I want to bring up to you and we'll just</v>

5795
02:37:25.231 --> 02:37:26.910
<v Speaker 9>end on this because we've been going on forever.</v>

5796
02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:31.800
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of podcasts that are doing podcasts now and find a live audiences</v>

5797
02:37:32.010 --> 02:37:34.350
<v Speaker 9>and it's a way of generating revenue for the podcast.</v>

5798
02:37:34.351 --> 02:37:38.070
<v Speaker 9>But they're not paying the people that are guests on the podcast,</v>

5799
02:37:38.490 --> 02:37:38.911
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

5800
02:37:38.911 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

<v Speaker 9>one invited me,</v>

5803
02:37:40.861 --> 02:37:41.880
<v Speaker 9>and I'm not going to name any names,</v>

5804
02:37:41.881 --> 02:37:45.330
<v Speaker 9>but invited me to go and be on one of their podcasts in front of a live</v>

5805
02:37:45.331 --> 02:37:46.080
<v Speaker 9>audience.</v>

5806
02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:46.913
<v Speaker 9>And I said,</v>

5807
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:47.670
<v Speaker 9>he know,</v>

5808
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:48.370
<v Speaker 9>you know what?</v>

5809
02:37:48.370 --> 02:37:49.440
<v Speaker 9>No one's picketing paid you.</v>

5810
02:37:49.441 --> 02:37:49.741
<v Speaker 9>Your,</v>

5811
02:37:49.741 --> 02:37:50.180
<v Speaker 9>you're going to do,</v>

5812
02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:52.140
<v Speaker 9>someone's going to drive an hour away.</v>

5813
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:53.190
<v Speaker 9>And I've done this before,</v>

5814
02:37:53.191 --> 02:37:53.611
<v Speaker 9>by the way,</v>

5815
02:37:53.611 --> 02:37:54.390
<v Speaker 9>because I just,</v>

5816
02:37:54.390 --> 02:37:54.990
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5817
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.823
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of a,</v>

5818
02:37:55.850 --> 02:37:56.460
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5819
02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:56.761
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5820
02:37:56.761 --> 02:37:59.310
<v Speaker 9>it's an opportunity to go and be on something and,</v>

5821
02:37:59.311 --> 02:37:59.610
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5822
02:37:59.610 --> 02:38:00.930
<v Speaker 9>have some fun and you know,</v>

5823
02:38:00.931 --> 02:38:02.970
<v Speaker 9>and network with all these other people that are doing these things.</v>

5824
02:38:03.210 --> 02:38:04.260
<v Speaker 9>But at a certain point in time,</v>

5825
02:38:04.261 --> 02:38:04.471
<v Speaker 9>I'd be like,</v>

5826
02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:04.831
<v Speaker 9>wait a minute,</v>

5827
02:38:04.831 --> 02:38:05.131
<v Speaker 9>wait a minute,</v>

5828
02:38:05.131 --> 02:38:05.490
<v Speaker 9>wait a minute.</v>

5829
02:38:05.490 --> 02:38:06.360
<v Speaker 9>How much do you charge?</v>

5830
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:08.880
<v Speaker 9>There's costs 20 bucks to get in,</v>

5831
02:38:08.881 --> 02:38:09.810
<v Speaker 9>or 30 bucks to get in.</v>

5832
02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.370
<v Speaker 9>And you've got 500 people in here.</v>

5833
02:38:11.490 --> 02:38:12.390
<v Speaker 9>What's going on here?</v>

5834
02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:14.070
<v Speaker 9>Is this a comedy show?</v>

5835
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:16.020
<v Speaker 9>Because if it's a comedy show that it makes sense that,</v>

5836
02:38:16.021 --> 02:38:16.291
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5837
02:38:16.291 --> 02:38:17.071
<v Speaker 9>you're the headliner,</v>

5838
02:38:17.071 --> 02:38:18.360
<v Speaker 9>but you have to pay the opening act.</v>

5839
02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:19.400
<v Speaker 9>You gotta pay the Middle Act,</v>

5840
02:38:19.401 --> 02:38:21.360
<v Speaker 9>you've got to pay everyone who performs on your show.</v>

5841
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:21.820
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

5842
02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.410
<v Speaker 7>it's a note that the bandwidth though,</v>

5843
02:38:23.411 --> 02:38:25.840
<v Speaker 7>that podcasts have been racking up on some people.</v>

5844
02:38:25.841 --> 02:38:27.100
<v Speaker 7>Like what was Adam Carolla saying?</v>

5845
02:38:27.101 --> 02:38:29.210
<v Speaker 7>Navy is paying up to $5,000 a month.</v>

5846
02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:29.981
<v Speaker 7>You said 10,000,</v>

5847
02:38:29.981 --> 02:38:30.870
<v Speaker 7>$10,000 a month.</v>

5848
02:38:31.090 --> 02:38:31.331
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

5849
02:38:31.331 --> 02:38:32.560
<v Speaker 7>that Shit's real shit,</v>

5850
02:38:32.561 --> 02:38:32.861
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

5851
02:38:32.861 --> 02:38:34.780
<v Speaker 7>That fucking bandwidth podcast,</v>

5852
02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:36.160
<v Speaker 7>we'll usually about 100 megabytes each.</v>

5853
02:38:36.161 --> 02:38:37.090
<v Speaker 7>He Times that by law,</v>

5854
02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:37.390
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

5855
02:38:37.390 --> 02:38:38.680
<v Speaker 7>a couple of hundred thousand people.</v>

5856
02:38:38.681 --> 02:38:39.970
<v Speaker 7>That's ridiculous.</v>

5857
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:41.353
<v Speaker 7>But you know what?</v>

5858
02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:41.931
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

5859
02:38:41.931 --> 02:38:42.350
<v Speaker 9>What,</v>

5860
02:38:42.350 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

5861
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.011
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5862
02:38:43.011 --> 02:38:43.341
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5863
02:38:43.341 --> 02:38:45.800
<v Speaker 9>how much does it benefit those comics to be on the show?</v>

5864
02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:47.000
<v Speaker 9>It benefits them a bit,</v>

5865
02:38:47.001 --> 02:38:50.070
<v Speaker 9>but it definitely benefits the person who's running the podcast to have a,</v>

5866
02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:52.060
<v Speaker 9>a star on their podcasts.</v>

5867
02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:52.461
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5868
02:38:52.461 --> 02:38:53.910
<v Speaker 9>if you're going to do it in front of a live on it.</v>

5869
02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:56.000
<v Speaker 9>So it's a weird situation right now.</v>

5870
02:38:56.001 --> 02:38:56.271
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

5871
02:38:56.271 --> 02:38:59.330
<v Speaker 9>it's a weird dynamic and almost feels like we need a union to step in.</v>

5872
02:38:59.750 --> 02:39:00.430
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

5873
02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:00.740
<v Speaker 9>what's,</v>

5874
02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:01.190
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5875
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:02.023
<v Speaker 9>how can you do that?</v>

5876
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:04.010
<v Speaker 9>There's just a basic logic,</v>

5877
02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.100
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5878
02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:06.290
<v Speaker 9>that should go behind.</v>

5879
02:39:06.291 --> 02:39:07.490
<v Speaker 9>If you're making a show,</v>

5880
02:39:07.491 --> 02:39:08.540
<v Speaker 9>if you're producing a show,</v>

5881
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:09.740
<v Speaker 9>there's just a basic logic,</v>

5882
02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:13.790
<v Speaker 9>the basic logic gates that the performers are the heart of the show.</v>

5883
02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:15.260
<v Speaker 9>If you're making money,</v>

5884
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:16.730
<v Speaker 9>you have to compensate them.</v>

5885
02:39:16.970 --> 02:39:17.900
<v Speaker 9>That's just logic.</v>

5886
02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:20.510
<v Speaker 9>You're not doing them a favor by letting them perform,</v>

5887
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:22.550
<v Speaker 9>but you are kind of a little bit because you're,</v>

5888
02:39:22.551 --> 02:39:22.941
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5889
02:39:22.941 --> 02:39:23.230
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

5890
02:39:23.230 --> 02:39:24.380
<v Speaker 9>you're giving them exposure.</v>

5891
02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:26.450
<v Speaker 9>Made me think about every time you come on this show,</v>

5892
02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:27.351
<v Speaker 9>I mean this show,</v>

5893
02:39:27.351 --> 02:39:31.220
<v Speaker 9>obviously we're not getting paid except for the sponsor and the sponsor.</v>

5894
02:39:31.221 --> 02:39:32.810
<v Speaker 9>Basically it's all gone.</v>

5895
02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.100
<v Speaker 9>I mean the sponsor pays for bandwidth and Brian and a bunch of other things and</v>

5896
02:39:36.101 --> 02:39:36.890
<v Speaker 9>it's all gone.</v>

5897
02:39:36.890 --> 02:39:37.900
<v Speaker 9>But you,</v>

5898
02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:40.970
<v Speaker 9>you get on a show like this and for sure it,</v>

5899
02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.860
<v Speaker 9>it elevates you and makes people aware of you.</v>

5900
02:39:42.861 --> 02:39:44.210
<v Speaker 9>But then on the other hand,</v>

5901
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:46.550
<v Speaker 9>the show's way better when you're on like it,</v>

5902
02:39:46.551 --> 02:39:47.570
<v Speaker 9>it benefits us too.</v>

5903
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:47.971
<v Speaker 9>Like Dan,</v>

5904
02:39:47.971 --> 02:39:51.560
<v Speaker 9>I used to bother me a lot about like radio shows were like someone would say</v>

5905
02:39:51.561 --> 02:39:52.700
<v Speaker 9>something douchey about someone.</v>

5906
02:39:52.701 --> 02:39:54.050
<v Speaker 9>The person wouldn't want to do the show anymore.</v>

5907
02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:54.441
<v Speaker 9>And they would say,</v>

5908
02:39:54.441 --> 02:39:54.621
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

5909
02:39:54.621 --> 02:39:55.430
<v Speaker 9>didn't we help you?</v>

5910
02:39:55.430 --> 02:39:56.360
<v Speaker 9>Didn't we help you out?</v>

5911
02:39:56.361 --> 02:39:56.990
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>

5912
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.321
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

5913
02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:57.891
<v Speaker 9>but you got to,</v>

5914
02:39:57.891 --> 02:39:58.760
<v Speaker 9>you can look at it that way.</v>

5915
02:39:58.761 --> 02:40:02.030
<v Speaker 9>But it also look at it like you need to have funny people on your shelf or your</v>

5916
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:02.864
<v Speaker 9>show to be good.</v>

5917
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:03.531
<v Speaker 9>He should be happy.</v>

5918
02:40:03.531 --> 02:40:04.490
<v Speaker 9>They go on it.</v>

5919
02:40:04.491 --> 02:40:06.280
<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't you know that the devil,</v>

5920
02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:07.190
<v Speaker 9>here's the insurance man,</v>

5921
02:40:07.250 --> 02:40:09.110
<v Speaker 9>this show for one.</v>

5922
02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:13.920
<v Speaker 9>I've made a fortune and flashlights fucking many.</v>

5923
02:40:14.270 --> 02:40:15.103
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

5924
02:40:15.350 --> 02:40:16.890
<v Speaker 4>and the other thing about it is that,</v>

5925
02:40:17.010 --> 02:40:17.843
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5926
02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:19.950
<v Speaker 4>we're friends and it's like,</v>

5927
02:40:20.250 --> 02:40:21.083
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5928
02:40:21.450 --> 02:40:23.100
<v Speaker 4>there's no sense of like,</v>

5929
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:24.840
<v Speaker 4>you're lucky to be here.</v>

5930
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:26.420
<v Speaker 9>This is the best venue for you though,</v>

5931
02:40:26.421 --> 02:40:26.661
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

5932
02:40:26.661 --> 02:40:27.460
<v Speaker 9>This is the best,</v>

5933
02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:27.861
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5934
02:40:27.861 --> 02:40:28.150
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

5935
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:31.730
<v Speaker 9>the best opportunity that people have ever had to get a look at.</v>

5936
02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:36.050
<v Speaker 9>What's special about you and weird about you to have these long ass two and a</v>

5937
02:40:36.051 --> 02:40:37.730
<v Speaker 9>half plus our conversations,</v>

5938
02:40:37.770 --> 02:40:39.620
<v Speaker 9>we're get into weird depth about chess a little,</v>

5939
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:42.980
<v Speaker 9>but people get a chance to see your personality and the way you would never get</v>

5940
02:40:42.981 --> 02:40:47.030
<v Speaker 9>exposed to on a talk show or there's no way in some seven minute clip on,</v>

5941
02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:47.541
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5942
02:40:47.541 --> 02:40:48.321
<v Speaker 9>name the show.</v>

5943
02:40:48.321 --> 02:40:49.154
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5944
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:50.990
<v Speaker 9>I don't know when Jimmy Fallon,</v>

5945
02:40:50.991 --> 02:40:51.710
<v Speaker 9>the name,</v>

5946
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:52.950
<v Speaker 9>whatever the show is it any,</v>

5947
02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:53.793
<v Speaker 9>any of those shows?</v>

5948
02:40:53.810 --> 02:40:54.281
<v Speaker 9>What are you gonna do?</v>

5949
02:40:54.281 --> 02:40:57.130
<v Speaker 9>You're gonna talk about something for seven minutes and sitting at the desk and</v>

5950
02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:58.220
<v Speaker 9>come up with a cup of coffee.</v>

5951
02:40:58.270 --> 02:40:59.330
<v Speaker 9>Don't know people.</v>

5952
02:40:59.331 --> 02:41:02.070
<v Speaker 9>You know the way people know us from doing this show the,</v>

5953
02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:03.470
<v Speaker 9>they know you in a deep,</v>

5954
02:41:03.471 --> 02:41:08.030
<v Speaker 9>deep way that really there's no other opportunity to get this close to people</v>

5955
02:41:08.090 --> 02:41:10.100
<v Speaker 9>does close to the workings of the mind.</v>

5956
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.461
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

5957
02:41:10.461 --> 02:41:15.461
<v Speaker 4>I have fucking still ongoing conversations happening on Facebook with people</v>

5958
02:41:17.091 --> 02:41:18.320
<v Speaker 4>from this podcast.</v>

5959
02:41:18.321 --> 02:41:19.070
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

5960
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell them something crazy and then they'll email me like the most insane</v>

5961
02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:28.190
<v Speaker 4>subversive fucking video or just like really crazy shit.</v>

5962
02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I can't go on Facebook if I'm to stone because I'll start getting</v>

5963
02:41:31.251 --> 02:41:36.140
<v Speaker 4>paranoid because there'll be some like heavy duty weird fucking shit up there.</v>

5964
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.760
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5965
02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.481
<v Speaker 9>Well you know what ma'am,</v>

5966
02:41:37.481 --> 02:41:38.470
<v Speaker 9>this is what's going on.</v>

5967
02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:39.040
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5968
02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:40.180
<v Speaker 9>this is what's going on.</v>

5969
02:41:40.181 --> 02:41:43.540
<v Speaker 9>But we are connecting with like minded people in a way that's never been</v>

5970
02:41:43.541 --> 02:41:45.790
<v Speaker 9>available before and it's starting a network.</v>

5971
02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:46.081
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5972
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:47.890
<v Speaker 9>it's not just a network with podcasts,</v>

5973
02:41:47.891 --> 02:41:50.110
<v Speaker 9>with the death squad podcast and years of lavender hour,</v>

5974
02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:50.630
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5975
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:51.580
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible] that.</v>

5976
02:41:51.581 --> 02:41:54.820
<v Speaker 9>But it's also a network with all these fucking people on Facebook and all these</v>

5977
02:41:54.821 --> 02:41:57.970
<v Speaker 9>people on Twitter and these people that I met in Australia that came to the show</v>

5978
02:41:57.971 --> 02:41:58.804
<v Speaker 9>and these people that are,</v>

5979
02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:02.110
<v Speaker 9>I've got to show this weekend or this week rather a Wednesday night.</v>

5980
02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:03.100
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

5981
02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:03.731
<v Speaker 9>Wednesday night.</v>

5982
02:42:03.731 --> 02:42:05.080
<v Speaker 9>I'm at the Louisville,</v>

5983
02:42:05.081 --> 02:42:06.370
<v Speaker 9>Kentucky Improv.</v>

5984
02:42:06.490 --> 02:42:07.360
<v Speaker 9>That's my next gig.</v>

5985
02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:08.261
<v Speaker 9>And that's another one.</v>

5986
02:42:08.261 --> 02:42:10.870
<v Speaker 9>This is all promoted just strictly straight from,</v>

5987
02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:11.590
<v Speaker 9>from Twitter.</v>

5988
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:12.371
<v Speaker 9>You're going to know on there,</v>

5989
02:42:12.371 --> 02:42:13.120
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

5990
02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:14.260
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure we're going to have fun.</v>

5991
02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:15.340
<v Speaker 9>We have fun everywhere.</v>

5992
02:42:15.341 --> 02:42:16.174
<v Speaker 9>And that's the deal.</v>

5993
02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:16.451
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5994
02:42:16.451 --> 02:42:17.680
<v Speaker 9>I have fun in Australia,</v>

5995
02:42:17.681 --> 02:42:18.350
<v Speaker 9>I have fun.</v>

5996
02:42:18.350 --> 02:42:18.580
<v Speaker 9>We,</v>

5997
02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.570
<v Speaker 9>we were bringing these people all together and people are getting connected and</v>

5998
02:42:22.571 --> 02:42:24.030
<v Speaker 9>there's a movement going on and it's,</v>

5999
02:42:24.031 --> 02:42:24.460
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

6000
02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:26.410
<v Speaker 9>there's a movement of the mind.</v>

6001
02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:26.741
<v Speaker 9>There's,</v>

6002
02:42:26.741 --> 02:42:30.790
<v Speaker 9>this is an opportunity for people to find and connect with likeminded people</v>

6003
02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:32.470
<v Speaker 9>about things that they thought were interesting.</v>

6004
02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:34.960
<v Speaker 9>That fucking was not available just a year ago.</v>

6005
02:42:34.990 --> 02:42:35.201
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

6006
02:42:35.201 --> 02:42:35.471
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

6007
02:42:35.471 --> 02:42:37.540
<v Speaker 9>it was not available two years ago or three years ago.</v>

6008
02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.370
<v Speaker 9>It's like this new,</v>

6009
02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:40.660
<v Speaker 9>this new thought,</v>

6010
02:42:40.661 --> 02:42:43.180
<v Speaker 9>this new hive mind that's being created.</v>

6011
02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:43.751
<v Speaker 9>And it's not,</v>

6012
02:42:43.751 --> 02:42:43.951
<v Speaker 9>I'm not,</v>

6013
02:42:43.951 --> 02:42:45.340
<v Speaker 9>I'm not taking responsibility for it.</v>

6014
02:42:45.341 --> 02:42:45.501
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

6015
02:42:45.501 --> 02:42:46.990
<v Speaker 9>it's creating itself.</v>

6016
02:42:47.050 --> 02:42:49.420
<v Speaker 9>It's always been things that I've always been interested and it's always been</v>

6017
02:42:49.421 --> 02:42:50.620
<v Speaker 9>things that you've always been interested in.</v>

6018
02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:55.250
<v Speaker 4>It's refining and altering the way that I think about the world because I'll say</v>

6019
02:42:55.251 --> 02:42:56.084
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

6020
02:42:56.210 --> 02:43:00.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll obviously say some pretty stupid shit that I haven't thought about and I'll</v>

6021
02:43:00.831 --> 02:43:02.070
<v Speaker 4>get an email or,</v>

6022
02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:02.430
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

6023
02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:05.340
<v Speaker 4>or five Facebook messages correcting whatever fact.</v>

6024
02:43:05.470 --> 02:43:05.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6025
02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:07.040
<v Speaker 4>and usually very politely,</v>

6026
02:43:07.090 --> 02:43:07.511
<v Speaker 4>usually.</v>

6027
02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6028
02:43:07.850 --> 02:43:08.541
<v Speaker 4>very politely.</v>

6029
02:43:08.541 --> 02:43:09.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like,</v>

6030
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.381
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6031
02:43:09.381 --> 02:43:09.890
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6032
02:43:09.890 --> 02:43:10.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6033
02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and then and then I'll find myself walking</v>

6034
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:13.181
<v Speaker 6>the next day,</v>

6035
02:43:13.181 --> 02:43:14.310
<v Speaker 6>like walking my dog and just</v>

6036
02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:16.170
<v Speaker 9>thinking about that that way,</v>

6037
02:43:16.171 --> 02:43:18.350
<v Speaker 9>that then my new version of the uniform.</v>

6038
02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:18.901
<v Speaker 9>Absolutely.</v>

6039
02:43:18.901 --> 02:43:19.441
<v Speaker 9>And that's that.</v>

6040
02:43:19.441 --> 02:43:20.370
<v Speaker 9>That's the evolution.</v>

6041
02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:21.310
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

6042
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:21.841
<v Speaker 9>It's ours.</v>

6043
02:43:21.841 --> 02:43:22.620
<v Speaker 9>It's theirs.</v>

6044
02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:23.190
<v Speaker 9>It's we,</v>

6045
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.461
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

6046
02:43:23.461 --> 02:43:23.641
<v Speaker 9>I've,</v>

6047
02:43:23.641 --> 02:43:26.100
<v Speaker 9>I've said this many times that I've talked to a bunch of people that have said</v>

6048
02:43:26.101 --> 02:43:27.390
<v Speaker 9>they don't know anybody like us.</v>

6049
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:29.940
<v Speaker 9>They don't ever have the chance to have these opportunities to have these</v>

6050
02:43:29.941 --> 02:43:31.890
<v Speaker 9>conversations with people that are near them,</v>

6051
02:43:31.891 --> 02:43:35.400
<v Speaker 9>but now they get to sit in on these conversations and it's changing the way they</v>

6052
02:43:35.401 --> 02:43:35.820
<v Speaker 9>think.</v>

6053
02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:37.020
<v Speaker 9>What changes the way I think too,</v>

6054
02:43:37.021 --> 02:43:40.530
<v Speaker 9>because we're having these conversations on a really regular basis where we know</v>

6055
02:43:40.531 --> 02:43:41.760
<v Speaker 9>we're broadcasting them,</v>

6056
02:43:41.761 --> 02:43:43.770
<v Speaker 9>so we know a lot of the shit we say we have to be,</v>

6057
02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:45.660
<v Speaker 9>we have to check it and you have to correct it.</v>

6058
02:43:45.661 --> 02:43:46.950
<v Speaker 9>We have to do some Google searching,</v>

6059
02:43:46.951 --> 02:43:48.690
<v Speaker 9>we have to consider our options,</v>

6060
02:43:48.810 --> 02:43:50.490
<v Speaker 9>consider the the contrary argument,</v>

6061
02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:53.260
<v Speaker 9>and then we'll get all sorts of different cool comments and,</v>

6062
02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:54.930
<v Speaker 9>and different links and different things.</v>

6063
02:43:55.050 --> 02:43:57.210
<v Speaker 9>Here's another thing that they're doing on my message board.</v>

6064
02:43:57.211 --> 02:43:59.220
<v Speaker 9>Every time there's a podcast,</v>

6065
02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:03.000
<v Speaker 9>they'll start a thread where they analyze the podcast as it goes along,</v>

6066
02:44:03.001 --> 02:44:06.090
<v Speaker 9>and then they'll put links up and videos up to,</v>

6067
02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:07.343
<v Speaker 9>we're talking about.</v>

6068
02:44:07.410 --> 02:44:08.550
<v Speaker 9>It's fucking amazing,</v>

6069
02:44:08.551 --> 02:44:09.000
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

6070
02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.500
<v Speaker 9>And it's all natural.</v>

6071
02:44:10.501 --> 02:44:11.970
<v Speaker 9>It's all just a natural,</v>

6072
02:44:12.030 --> 02:44:12.221
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

6073
02:44:12.221 --> 02:44:12.301
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

6074
02:44:12.301 --> 02:44:12.810
<v Speaker 9>correct.</v>

6075
02:44:12.810 --> 02:44:13.643
<v Speaker 9>It's all just,</v>

6076
02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:15.450
<v Speaker 9>it's just grown out of interest and,</v>

6077
02:44:15.451 --> 02:44:15.691
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

6078
02:44:15.691 --> 02:44:15.961
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

6079
02:44:15.961 --> 02:44:16.231
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

6080
02:44:16.231 --> 02:44:20.040
<v Speaker 9>and it spreads and then people contribute to it and then it gets larger and</v>

6081
02:44:20.041 --> 02:44:20.730
<v Speaker 9>larger.</v>

6082
02:44:20.730 --> 02:44:20.911
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

6083
02:44:20.911 --> 02:44:21.630
<v Speaker 9>it really is.</v>

6084
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:22.530
<v Speaker 9>There's a hive mind.</v>

6085
02:44:23.130 --> 02:44:23.941
<v Speaker 9>It's going on bitches.</v>

6086
02:44:23.941 --> 02:44:24.591
<v Speaker 9>It's going on right now.</v>

6087
02:44:24.591 --> 02:44:25.300
<v Speaker 9>And that's what we're gonna do.</v>

6088
02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:25.511
<v Speaker 6>Can I,</v>

6089
02:44:25.511 --> 02:44:27.580
<v Speaker 6>can I say once something I've got coming up?</v>

6090
02:44:27.581 --> 02:44:28.414
<v Speaker 6>Can I have no,</v>

6091
02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:30.320
<v Speaker 6>no plugs.</v>

6092
02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:31.601
<v Speaker 6>Capitalism.</v>

6093
02:44:31.601 --> 02:44:32.200
<v Speaker 6>Boy,</v>

02:44:34.781 --> 02:44:37.750
<v Speaker 6>Thursday we kept with gay this gate and it's out.</v>

6099
02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:38.740

<v Speaker 6>This would be the end.</v>

6138
02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.860
<v Speaker 6>It's because this guy,</v>

6139
02:45:24.310 --> 02:45:25.890
<v Speaker 6>he went on these shows,</v>

6140
02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:29.380
<v Speaker 6>he pretended that he knows how to do the Yo Yo yo for kids.</v>

6141
02:45:29.410 --> 02:45:31.600
<v Speaker 6>You did a character on these morning shows.</v>

6142
02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:34.780
<v Speaker 6>He apparently you could just send them a letter and Sam traveling through</v>

6143
02:45:34.781 --> 02:45:38.740
<v Speaker 6>schools doing environmental lessons and using Yoyos to do it.</v>

6144
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:40.120
<v Speaker 6>And it kind of seems like a nice,</v>

6145
02:45:40.121 --> 02:45:40.781
<v Speaker 6>good feel.</v>

6146
02:45:40.781 --> 02:45:41.614
<v Speaker 6>Good story.</v>

6147
02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:42.670
<v Speaker 6>And so they invite him,</v>

6148
02:45:42.671 --> 02:45:43.090
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

6149
02:45:43.090 --> 02:45:44.980
<v Speaker 6>he's wearing this ridiculous outfit.</v>

6150
02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:45.740
<v Speaker 6>He's a,</v>

6151
02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:46.061
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6152
02:45:46.061 --> 02:45:49.660
<v Speaker 6>he's a a character actor on the level within like when Kaufman would do his</v>

6153
02:45:49.661 --> 02:45:49.961
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

6154
02:45:49.961 --> 02:45:54.961
<v Speaker 6>he's that fucking good and he's this adult guy who comes on stage with the Yoyo</v>

6155
02:45:56.290 --> 02:45:59.140
<v Speaker 6>Eric and doesn't really get to the Yoyo.</v>

6156
02:45:59.141 --> 02:46:02.450
<v Speaker 6>They finally ended up having to ask him to do it every day</v>

6157
02:46:03.970 --> 02:46:05.980
<v Speaker 6>and every time they ask him to do it,</v>

6158
02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:07.780
<v Speaker 6>something awful goes wrong.</v>

6159
02:46:07.781 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 6>The Yoyo breaks,</v>

6160
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 6>he can't Yo yo.</v>

6161
02:46:12.990 --> 02:46:14.400
<v Speaker 6>And he just leaves them hanging everything.</v>

6162
02:46:14.410 --> 02:46:14.660
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

6163
02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:17.450
<v Speaker 6>it's awkward and they want to like make him feel better,</v>

6164
02:46:17.451 --> 02:46:18.680
<v Speaker 6>but he's like each time,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like he like he's clearly like out of it.</v>
