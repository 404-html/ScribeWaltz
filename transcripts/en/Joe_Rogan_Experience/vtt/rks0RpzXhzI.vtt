1
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>No abandoned three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two</v>

2
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 2>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up buddy?</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sound of the thing in the background.</v>

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was wasn't.</v>

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>That's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll shut that off.</v>

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you shut it off?</v>

9
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 2>dad is because there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was smoke in this room and the</v>

11
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Godfather has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 2>an issue with the smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get over your asthma?</v>

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around puberty it often subsides,</v>

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're quite athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was.</v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And then it completely went away by</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 13 and only came back by about 25,</v>

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm not full blown asthmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only when I get sick,</v>

17
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.981
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

18
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 2>get a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will migrate to my chest.</v>

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Turned into bronchitis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what will take you four days to</v>

20
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might take me a month of whooping cough.</v>

21
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm really careful about not</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a quote.</v>

22
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be a hand washer.</v>

23
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why when I came out of the</v>

24
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my instinct was to tell Jamie as I was</v>

25
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 2>shaking his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I washed my hands because I'm always</v>

26
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>careful about checking other people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

27
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to extend them the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>courtesy.</v>

28
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

29
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I shake some people's hands and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they just dumped it in the pool.</v>

30
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's some people like they get so sweaty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you shake their hand.</v>

31
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:23.911
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

32
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on with his hand?</v>

33
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of weird bacteria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this article that was saying that</v>

34
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>water bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you reuse water bottle,</v>

35
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 2>they've tested them and they say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less bacteria on dog toys.</v>

36
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 2>that's why by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've resorted to fist bumping because</v>

38
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just reduces the amount of germ</v>

39
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 2>transfer from one person to the other by</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going like this,</v>

40
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>compromises your immune system by not</v>

41
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 2>exposing it to a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

42
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 2>There is actually research on this right</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an illusionary medicine.</v>

43
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Kids who grow up in very sterile</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments end up suffering from</v>

44
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 2>greater respiratory ailments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely because their system hasn't</v>

45
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>been kicked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rarely get sick and I shake a lot of</v>

47
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a lot of people that don't</v>

48
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 2>and they're kind of sick all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to get sick.</v>

49
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's what's going on.</v>

50
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe with French kiss later after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other exciting.</v>

51
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Don't you threatened me with a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

52
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you partake of</v>

54
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

55
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>to consume probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you would eat acidophilus or yogurt</v>

56
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 2>or yogurt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like Kimchi.</v>

57
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it by design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe just those preferences are</v>

58
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 2>healthy and so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to hear that they are good</v>

59
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 2>probiotics and for grapplers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

60
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>grapplers are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

61
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 2>particular about the consumption of</v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics because we get a lot of</v>

62
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 2>ringworm and I'm also a staph infections</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

63
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different infections</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people can get from.</v>

64
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Especially ringworm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know staph infections is really more for</v>

65
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an open cut.</v>

66
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having healthy skin flora is very</v>

67
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why all</v>

68
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>you kids listening don't use</v>
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics.</v>

69
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the right way to go.</v>

70
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of healthy soaps that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>used like tea tree oil and eucalyptus</v>

71
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 3>that are really good for you that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotic.</v>

72
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep the idea of warm and mind because</v>

73
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 3>later I'd like to talk about brain worms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how it relates to a condition that</v>

74
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 3>is affecting the west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can get into it now or you mean like</v>

75
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Toxoplasma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be one.</v>

76
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 3>There's other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many others.</v>

77
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to get into that now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

78
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the polsky on.</v>

79
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 3>I know know I should write to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was amazing.</v>

80
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 3>He is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote to him a while ago,</v>

81
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe a year and a half or two years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

82
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 3>but at the time he to come on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

83
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 3>but he was very busy writing a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>

84
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:42.900
<v Speaker 3>which I'm guessing he's probably done</v>
<v Speaker 3>with now.</v>

85
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he was busy then.</v>

86
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 3>We had a meet him in La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his hotel room,</v>

87
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 3>and we had to film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only had an hour.</v>

88
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 3>He literally landed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got into his hotel room.</v>

89
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 3>We went with him as he opened up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>door to his hotel.</v>

90
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 3>We sat down with them and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little table and chair there is</v>

91
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically I argued that in the same</v>

93
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 3>way that there are all sorts of animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that once they are infected with this</v>

94
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 3>brain warm and they are different</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantiations of it,</v>

95
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

96
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become zombified,</v>

97
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

98
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 3>just to give you another example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spider wasp will sting the spider,</v>

99
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is much bigger than it rendering</v>

100
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zombified then carries it into its</v>

101
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 3>burrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lays its eggs on the invivo spider,</v>

102
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 3>and then when the eggs hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat it in Vivo.</v>

103
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 3>And I argued that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political correctness is akin to the</v>

104
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 3>spider wasps sting because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>zombifies us into walking quietly</v>

105
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.800
<v Speaker 3>through the abyss of infinite darkness a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

106
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Horrible things are happening around us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why we think that we're doing the</v>

107
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 3>right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we think that yet we know we're</v>

108
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're being not racist and good and</v>

109
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.800
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

110
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to go back to the brain warm idea,</v>

111
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.741
<v Speaker 3>so I coined the term not to be cute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to actually name this collective</v>

112
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 3>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called it ostrich per acidic syndrome.</v>

113
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before.</v>

114
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 3>We talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that that's a myth.</v>

115
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.711
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

116
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:06.544
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the Boston.</v>

117
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Because it's become just a metaphor for</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

118
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.084
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

119
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>The Myth being folks that ostriches</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really stick their head in the</v>

120
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

121
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

122
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 3>it's really taken on a life of its own.</v>

123
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 3>At this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually thinking of studying this</v>

124
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 3>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just as something that I talk about</v>

125
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 3>in my public engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that causes some people to be</v>

126
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:32.551
<v Speaker 3>more likely to be arrested enticed by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the types of mindsets that would cause</v>

127
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 3>you to suffer from ostrich parasitic</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndrome.</v>

128
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 3>So a classic example would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I guess we'll we'll get into</v>

129
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 3>how much evidence do you need to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world that there might be</v>

130
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>some religious ideology that is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic and antithetical to secular</v>

131
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 3>liberal modern values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much information or what is the type</v>

132
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 3>of information that you would need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see before you are able to arrive to</v>

133
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>such a conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one</v>

134
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>of the things I'm thinking of doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to formally quantify a score of ops,</v>

135
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 2>how much somebody suffers from won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

136
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>as a type of mindset and what are some</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictors that could help us understand</v>

137
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 2>who is more or less likely to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>afflicted by this mindset?</v>

138
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain people that just never</v>

139
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 2>want to hurt anyone's feelings except</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they think that it is within their</v>

140
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>rights to attack that person because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person is somehow or another</v>

141
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>victimizing someone else and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be far more egregious than the</v>

142
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 2>original offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know about that guy that in</v>

143
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Canada that's getting sued?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Human Rights Council find him</v>

145
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 2>$12,000 because you walked into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment that he owned with shoes on</v>

146
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>because there was a Muslim family living</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

147
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lease was up and he was looking to</v>

148
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 2>rent the apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped responding to his texts and</v>

149
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 2>so he opened up the apartment to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

150
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this apartment that he owns and because</v>

151
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 2>he walked into a building that he owns</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his shoes on,</v>

152
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 2>he has to pay them $12,000 for failing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accommodate their religious practices</v>

153
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 2>while showing their apartment to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective tenants.</v>

154
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to Canada.</v>

155
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 2>We just had a thing called the motion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one.</v>

156
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:13.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

157
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

158
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Look at this statement that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

159
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.581
<v Speaker 2>but the human rights tribunal of Ontario</v>
<v Speaker 2>also found that he harassed them and</v>

160
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 2>created a poisoned housing environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

161
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he refused to remove issues.</v>

162
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Some sensibilities are more equal than</v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

163
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 2>but that is just what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that people are so.</v>

164
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with Muslims,</v>

165
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>like you'll notice that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>

166
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 2>they will accuse everyone of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia yet they'll shit on</v>

167
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.794
<v Speaker 2>Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 2>It's really common like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that they believe in religious</v>

169
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that they have like a pet cause and</v>

170
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.971
<v Speaker 2>the pet causes almost like being a and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of far right people who are</v>

171
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>really terrified of Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're trying to like figure out</v>

172
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to balance that out with their own</v>

173
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous leftwing version of it.</v>

174
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are two elements to it.</v>

175
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>One is that they're just afraid to</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize because bumps,</v>

176
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 2>because they are greater repercussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do so than to criticize seventh day</v>

177
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>adventist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just from a very basic sort of</v>

178
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>survival instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think secondly,</v>

179
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of part of the ostrich</v>
<v Speaker 2>parasitics internal,</v>

180
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>not speaking of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are all sort of erroneous ideas</v>

181
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>that people have been infected with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

182
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

183
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

184
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim religion is a religion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the downtrodden,</v>

185
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 2>the Brown people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exotic other and so to,</v>

186
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 2>to criticize them when they are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hapless exotic minority is simply racist</v>

187
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>and sexist and people believe that even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though most of the countries that these</v>

188
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>people are coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come to the west,</v>

189
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>not only are they the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost the exclusive majority</v>

190
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are out of I think 56 countries</v>

191
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>that constitute</v>

192
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>the OIC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Organization of Islamic cooperation,</v>

193
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 3>something like 29 or 30 countries that</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusively Islamic.</v>

194
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 3>They are no longer any religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>minorities.</v>

195
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 3>It's in the order of 99 point nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

196
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So to argue that people who come from</v>
<v Speaker 3>these countries are,</v>

197
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious minorities,</v>

198
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 3>religious minorities when they come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the west,</v>

199
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but they're all coming from countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>where not nevermind that they're the</v>

200
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 3>majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've never interacted with someone</v>

201
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 3>who did not share their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people understand that if</v>

202
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 3>that happens here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't turn back from that</v>

203
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.070
<v Speaker 3>without violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

204
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:31.904
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

205
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it would happen in</v>

206
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that it can happen anywhere</v>

207
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 3>means it can happen everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

208
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:40.730
<v Speaker 3>it really can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

209
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big reach on my part to say that</v>

210
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 3>because there is no evidence whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going to happen here,</v>

211
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.750
<v Speaker 3>but if you really look at some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries that are suffering under this</v>

212
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 3>really oppressive religious ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>where women aren't allowed to drive,</v>

213
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 3>where they have to wear a covering all</v>
<v Speaker 3>over their body,</v>

214
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 3>that signifies that they're a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this religious sect.</v>

215
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Like if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone tried to do that today,</v>

216
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 3>like if you had some blonde haired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue eyed guy that made all women wear a</v>

217
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 3>certain outfit and they weren't allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drive and they weren't allowed to</v>

218
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>have the same rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people would be standing up for</v>

219
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

220
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it was a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

221
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 3>there's something about old things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>old ideologies in legitimacy.</v>

222
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 3>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

223
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it's exactly what you said,</v>

224
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>you take an idea that someone holds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't cloak cloak under the robe</v>

225
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 3>of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you commit them to a psychiatric</v>

226
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he says,</v>

227
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.201
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

228
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:33.391
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

229
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 3>but this belief as part of my religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly you get a free pass.</v>

230
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 3>That's grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to speak to your point about,</v>

231
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 3>well that you are stretching about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in the United States.</v>

232
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 3>You're not stretching it at all.</v>

233
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've argued at,</v>

234
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

235
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 3>when trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you look at a longterm view of</v>

236
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.980
<v Speaker 3>the issue of Islamic immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

237
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if what you focus on is,</v>

238
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have the proper vetting processes</v>

239
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 3>to stop terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isis terrorists from coming in.</v>

240
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a very short term view of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

241
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 3>But if you recognize that societies will</v>
<v Speaker 3>take often,</v>

242
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.310
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time before they become</v>

243
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 3>islamized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as though every single country</v>

244
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>that today is Islamic became</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously overnight Islamic.</v>

245
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 3>In some cases it wasn't very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quick invasion.</v>

246
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 3>In other cases it took 500 years before</v>
<v Speaker 3>the demographic reality shifted.</v>

247
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 3>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it from the perspective</v>

248
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 3>of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

249
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 years,</v>

250
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 3>the US stands no threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but take a longterm view.</v>

251
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I love this quote from I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>who said it,</v>

252
00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 3>that the United States have all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>clocks and watches we have all the time</v>

253
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

254
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 3>in Shatila.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually God willing,</v>

255
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 3>we will conquer you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the right way to look at this</v>

256
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you wish to have a society become</v>

257
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>more islamized or less?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me draw</v>

258
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.330
<v Speaker 2>another analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

259
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>at the end of every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can weigh yourself and one of three</v>

260
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.320
<v Speaker 2>things is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've either lost weight that they get</v>

261
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 2>a weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not change a single ounce or you've</v>

262
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 2>put on weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's analogize this with Islam.</v>

263
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>When Islam comes into a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either the society gets better,</v>

264
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 2>nothing changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it gets worse.</v>

265
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Do we have enough data at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after 1400 years to suggest that we can</v>

266
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>try to bet what will happen to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>society?</v>

267
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 2>The answer regrettably is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

268
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I hate to have to preface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

269
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 2>most Muslims are lovely and peaceful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wish to simply raise their children,</v>

270
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 2>but Islam as an ideology when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a new society,</v>

271
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>is that a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If yes,</v>

272
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 2>let's alternate Islamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If no,</v>

273
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 2>then maybe we should have an honest</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about this and honest</v>

274
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 2>conversation is what's really important</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these things get so emotionally</v>

275
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:50.371
<v Speaker 2>charged like the infamous Ben Affleck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris Debacle on Bill Maher show,</v>

276
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but that to me is a perfect example</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Sam speaks in such a measured</v>

277
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.450
<v Speaker 2>tone and he's so educated about it.</v>

278
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 2>He's not making these big gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaps,</v>

279
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>but people love to jump on him and call</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

280
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.910
<v Speaker 2>He sent me some video that I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched the other day.</v>

281
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 2>We were a bunch of people are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking complete out of context</v>

282
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 2>statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attributing to him as being like,</v>

283
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>this is what he believes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things.</v>

284
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 2>When if you listen to the full extent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation,</v>

285
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 2>he's literally saying like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say something here that</v>

286
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 2>could be taken out of context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is imagine if</v>

287
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 2>someone was saying this right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you respond to that?</v>

288
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.330
<v Speaker 2>And they use that as a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>

289
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 2>There's so much of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much,</v>

290
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:39.750
<v Speaker 2>so dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>

291
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird not me thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

292
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

293
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's racist and they get very.</v>

294
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Your racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Ben Affleck thing,</v>

295
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so gross that it's so racist.</v>

296
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of just discussing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

297
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm discussing this especially on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill Maher show because that shows all</v>

298
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 2>those shows is not to criticize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

299
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 2>but all those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a panel of six people.</v>

300
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 2>What you see is a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to say something and they have</v>

301
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 2>to jump in and it's almost like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be salacious or they have to be</v>

302
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>outrageous just to get heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

303
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:17.450
<v Speaker 2>like everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>

304
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Those kinds of shows promote this sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disingenuous communication because</v>

305
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be polite like you and I can</v>

306
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>be polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you and I,</v>

307
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 2>we can talk and we can have these long</v>
<v Speaker 2>form conversations,</v>

308
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:34.231
<v Speaker 2>but on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the time to unpack what's</v>

309
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:39.220
<v Speaker 2>wrong with all ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things that tell you how to think.</v>

310
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Forget about whether or not you think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from Jesus or the Prophet Muhammad</v>

311
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 2>or Joseph Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime there's a doctrine that tells</v>

312
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you how to think because of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical presence,</v>

313
00:14:50.571 --> 00:14:55.571
<v Speaker 2>some God or Deity or prophet who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten the wisdom of the universe and</v>

314
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 2>you met at must not question it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women have to wear veils and dress</v>

315
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>up like beekeepers and I mean all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is very,</v>

316
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 2>very problematic because people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>prone for whatever reason.</v>

317
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's something that goes back to</v>

318
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 2>tribalism and Alpha male chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

319
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 2>We're prone to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prone to follow leaders.</v>

320
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it easier and that's one of the</v>

321
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 2>things you're seeing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

322
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>what's amazing is that it's one thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack Sam because of the game of</v>

323
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He scores really poorly,</v>

324
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a southern California and white</v>

325
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 2>male who doesn't speak any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages that matter Arabic or so on.</v>

326
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And his parents had money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his parents had money.</v>

327
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 2>So I've loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your parents had money,</v>

328
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 2>you her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

329
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I only recently found out maybe a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a year and a half ago when I met him</v>

330
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his mother is the creator of golden</v>

331
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:47.864
<v Speaker 2>girls is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

332
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.823
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that.</v>

333
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

334
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I just looked at one of the golden girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was rerunning and uc,</v>

335
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Susan Harris or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

336
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like me who comes from the</v>

337
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Middle East who escape that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I had</v>

338
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 2>many people on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

339
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you followed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people who've all escaped</v>

340
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 2>from this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either they still considered themselves</v>

341
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Muslim but know not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Muslim light or ex Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In many cases they will be attached.</v>

343
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 2>so there was some woman who went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wellesley college who doesn't know</v>

345
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 2>anything about Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short of whatever she learned in her</v>

346
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 2>bullshit progressive course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would lecture to us what true Islam</v>

347
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the people who lived under it,</v>

348
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 2>not the people who ran away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows better because.</v>

349
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.211
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

350
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's grotesque.</v>

351
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 2>It's infuriating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning.</v>

352
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's also confusing because like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

353
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 2>when you see them do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anytime someone goes so far</v>

354
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:47.640
<v Speaker 2>overboard that objective reasoning is</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the window and you're,</v>

355
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so committed to whatever position</v>

356
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 2>that you're in that you can't look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides of it.</v>

357
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

358
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I could see why a lot of religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions would be comforting to people</v>

359
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>remind them of where they came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them pride of their homeland and</v>

360
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 2>give them a personal good feeling.</v>

361
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 2>They're connected to some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient tradition,</v>

362
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's not oppressing other</v>

363
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's gotta be some.</v>

364
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean I actually cultural patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that people do,</v>

365
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 2>like celebrations like Oktoberfest or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

366
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Those things promote some sort of pride</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I guess a pride in Germany and</v>

367
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>their beer making and all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>without oppressing people,</v>

368
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the way,</v>

369
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 2>this is a good segue to what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about is something that is</v>

370
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 2>upsetting me these days increasingly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people are now trying to draw a</v>

371
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 2>distinction between Islam and Islamism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I mentioned this is</v>

372
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 2>because Islam has two elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the spiritual part,</v>

373
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

374
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda</v>

375
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 3>like your October fest that prayed this</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

376
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 3>believe in a god in a monotheistic God</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>

377
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.920
<v Speaker 3>But then within Islam is a much larger</v>
<v Speaker 3>component of politics,</v>

378
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 3>political Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say something like,</v>

379
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.391
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 3>we should be attacking Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam as if it's something that is</v>

381
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 3>outside of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's simply false Islam.</v>

382
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Islam is Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right around the one,</v>

383
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 3>the prime minister of Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can quote many other,</v>

384
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic experts said Islam is Islam.</v>

385
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 3>The term moderate Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>

386
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these other qualifiers are</v>

387
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 3>nonsensical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

388
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:34.341
<v Speaker 3>the reason why that upsets me is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it grants people a false sense of</v>

389
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.650
<v Speaker 3>security and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Islam is wonderful,</v>

390
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 3>but we need to attack this separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing called Islamism.</v>

391
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Well from day one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1400 years ago,</v>

392
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Islam was Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

393
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual element.</v>

394
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that most Muslims just</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to practice the spiritual part,</v>

395
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.320
<v Speaker 3>but there is no set of doctrines and as</v>
<v Speaker 3>separate book called radicalized Islam,</v>

396
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all comes from the same texts.</v>

397
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 3>It comes from the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from the Heidi's,</v>

398
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 3>and it comes from the CEO at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biography of Muhammad,</v>

399
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this kind of false narrative that</v>

400
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 3>people are promulgating so that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem as though they're not frontally</v>

401
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 3>attacking religion while laudable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while Nice,</v>

402
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I get that reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's false and so again,</v>

403
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 3>to go back to our point of talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

404
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 3>we need to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

405
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 3>there's only Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people choose to practice it fully.</v>

406
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Some people choose to ignore the ugly</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts,</v>

407
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 3>but there is no such thing as Islamism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

408
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Islam is part of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a person that goes out of</v>

409
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.410
<v Speaker 3>your way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

410
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about the kind sweet</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic people that just want to raise</v>

411
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 3>their children now.</v>

412
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.310
<v Speaker 3>So how do you sort of manage those two</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that they're the same?</v>

413
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Like when the term radical Islam gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown around,</v>

414
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So radical Islam simply means I really</v>

415
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 3>take my Islam seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

416
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's draw a silly analogy.</v>

417
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.430
<v Speaker 3>If I don't eat pork in my radical Jew or</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I a Jew right now,</v>

418
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I happen to be Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I simply ignore the kosher edict that</v>

419
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:13.230
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat pork.</v>

420
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 3>That does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you do that though?</v>

421
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Because in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I simply identify as Jewish in the sense</v>

422
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 3>that at Judaism is a multi attribute</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

423
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 3>It includes a shared history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shared lineage,</v>

424
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.690
<v Speaker 3>a shit kind of erase what some could</v>
<v Speaker 3>argue it's array,</v>

425
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 3>so it's considered in a lot of people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas so I could still in the same way</v>

426
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 3>that you might identify as coming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston and there's a shared history from</v>

427
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 3>all people who grew up around the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you grew up in Boston and there was</v>

428
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 3>a sense of affiliation and tribalism.</v>

429
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Would that reality being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned and for most</v>

430
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is exactly that.</v>

431
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 3>We don't necessarily take the religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>elements very seriously.</v>

432
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that we are practicing</v>

433
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.890
<v Speaker 3>a light Judaism or non-radical Judaism</v>
<v Speaker 3>where simply ignoring those parts of</v>

434
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Judaism that we choose to ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there is no such thing as radical</v>

435
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no books called radical Islam.</v>

436
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 3>There is a set of doctrines called Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I could do what's called</v>

437
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 3>cafeteria Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I pick and choose the parts</v>

438
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 3>that I wished to adhere to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

439
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 3>the discourse as a false narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the reason for it because</v>

440
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.050
<v Speaker 3>people find it rather Gauche to attack</v>
<v Speaker 3>frontally it religion at least to attack</v>

441
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have to.</v>

442
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I call this the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

443
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.140
<v Speaker 3>the ISM magic eucharistic rite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your ad isn't to something.</v>

444
00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 3>It makes it bad.</v>

445
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Islam is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamism is bad for you.</v>

446
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to defend you if there's a</v>

447
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that are listening right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now or offer up some,</v>

448
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even defend you,</v>

449
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:51.541
<v Speaker 3>but offer up some information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you grew up in a place where</v>

450
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 3>being Jewish was lethal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

451
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 3>your life was threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started on the,</v>

452
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 3>when the civil war broke out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prior to that you could live in Lebanon</v>

453
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:03.280
<v Speaker 3>as a do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People knew that we were Jewish,</v>

454
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 3>but know your place Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That by the way,</v>

455
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:08.610
<v Speaker 3>is something that I explained when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when discussing on,</v>

456
00:22:08.611 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if we've discussed this on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

457
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 3>but it might be worth repeating as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed your past in Lebanon.</v>

458
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>How you so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so do you know what a dummy is?</v>

459
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard that term?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

460
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.780
<v Speaker 3>you explained it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but please do again just so dim.</v>

461
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Me As a third class citizen comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Koranic edicts that basically said that</v>

462
00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 3>when when Islam comes into a society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically have three choices.</v>

463
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're not a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can either convert,</v>

464
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 3>you could either get killed or if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are people of the book,</v>

465
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.220
<v Speaker 3>meaning Christians and Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning people of the book that you're</v>

466
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 3>also monotheistic here also from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abrahamic faith.</v>

467
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Then you could live as a DM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and then me as a protected class,</v>

468
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 3>protected and quotes we tolerate you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to tolerate,</v>

469
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:58.051
<v Speaker 3>you were going to remind you repeatedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>have your subservient position.</v>

470
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Now at different points across the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>1400 years.</v>

471
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 3>That mechanism was either instituted</v>
<v Speaker 3>very forcefully or more lightly so in</v>

472
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:10.090
<v Speaker 3>the context of Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is which was a very progressive</v>

473
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>and modern country in the Middle Eastern</v>
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

474
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't somebody knocking on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>door and loving the pay us or else we're</v>

475
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 3>going to rape your daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't wear a big star of David</v>

476
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 3>because that might be construed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory.</v>

477
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Just like the example that you started</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the show,</v>

478
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 3>you're hurting our sensibilities by</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing your Judaism on us,</v>

479
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your your status did not always have</v>

480
00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:39.610
<v Speaker 3>been threatened in that my head is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come off at any minute.</v>

481
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents grew up and lived there.</v>

482
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 3>They didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once the civil war broke out,</v>

483
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 3>then it became lethally dangerous to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish.</v>

484
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were going to be executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We left so you never know when we're</v>

485
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:57.311
<v Speaker 3>going to go from tolerating you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>offload the heads and that's been the</v>

486
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 3>history for the past 1400 years and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

487
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 3>when people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Islam is not that bad.</v>

488
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Look and under lucier a Jews and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians and Muslims use to walk</v>

489
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:11.840
<v Speaker 3>around hand in hand and in Spain around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 15th,</v>

490
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 3>16th century below me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

491
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 3>People were not being beheaded everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you knew your place.</v>

492
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 3>That's not equality and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting when you talk about this</v>

493
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.660
<v Speaker 3>idea about how people are reluctant to</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize Islam because they're worried</v>

494
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:35.111
<v Speaker 3>about the repercussions of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of speaks to how rare it is that</v>

495
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:41.171
<v Speaker 3>people do violate those principles in</v>
<v Speaker 3>those countries because if you do have a</v>

496
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:46.181
<v Speaker 3>culture that's 99 percent Islamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they go by the book,</v>

497
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 3>like every step of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's not going to be a lot of</v>

498
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 3>people that are stepping on the line for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear of the horrific repercussions.</v>

499
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Now psychologically in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing that for some strange</v>

500
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:04.661
<v Speaker 3>reason emerging from the left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>emerging from a lot of like really</v>

501
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 3>progressive colleges and universities</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they want to be almost the first</v>

502
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:13.961
<v Speaker 3>ones to step up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't criticize this one particular</v>

503
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

504
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.950
<v Speaker 3>it's very odd because it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive.</v>

505
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

506
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a really strange position to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive who's reinforcing the</v>

507
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:30.581
<v Speaker 3>ideologies of a regressive culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very ancient.</v>

508
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.550
<v Speaker 3>But what's incredible is that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with ways to defend this</v>

509
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 3>cognitive inconsistency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hence,</v>

510
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the ostrich parasitic</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndrome that I was mentioning.</v>

511
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are some ways that they defend?</v>

512
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 3>So example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

513
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 3>and it just gives you a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestations of ostrich logic.</v>

514
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 3>My friend Mohammed is a very nice guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he drinks and he fornicated and he's</v>

515
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 3>very liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea then becomes that as long as</v>

516
00:25:55.161 --> 00:26:00.161
<v Speaker 3>I can identify a single exemplar of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic person who does not otherwise,</v>

517
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adhere to what Islam dictates,</v>

518
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.300
<v Speaker 3>then it's not true that Islam is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is,</v>

519
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 3>this is a manifestation of a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive bias which goes like</v>

520
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:13.010
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I walk into class and I say,</v>

521
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a homo sapiens are sexually dimorphic,</v>

522
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 3>they are an eight sex differences</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the two sexes.</v>

523
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Men are bigger than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone will put up their hand and say,</v>

524
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 3>but my aunt Linda is taller than my</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle Joe.</v>

525
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh Gee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwin is dead.</v>

526
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

527
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:32.370
<v Speaker 3>they identify a singular exemplar that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to falsify a statement that</v>

528
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 3>is only true at the population level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's.</v>

529
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So that's one example why Muhammad is</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice.</v>

530
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Therefore Islam is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a second example.</v>

531
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 3>They point to a particular historical</v>
<v Speaker 3>context where Jews lived in Islamic</v>

532
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 3>countries and weren't killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hae but God's side.</v>

533
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>You lived in Lebanon and you still have</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>

534
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 3>And the torque that I usually give as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well until they were going to cut off my</v>

535
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But secondly,</v>

536
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Dahmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take,</v>

537
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was guilty of 17 murders,</v>

538
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 3>if you take the number of days that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived as an adult until he was caught as</v>

539
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.180
<v Speaker 3>a percentage of the days that he killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

540
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 3>90 nine point whatever percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

541
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Dahmer is a lovely guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's unfair for you to say that</v>

542
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Dahmer is a mean guy given that</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 percent of the time,</v>

543
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 3>he's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you have to basically do is take</v>

544
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.580
<v Speaker 3>each of these ostrich logic arguments</v>
<v Speaker 3>and analogize how the Arctic they are,</v>

545
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's very exhausting because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bent,</v>

546
00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all these progressives,</v>

547
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 3>is to do what ever they can to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideology.</v>

548
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:41.760
<v Speaker 3>And so it becomes exhausting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently have to try to fight</v>

549
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 3>through all the clutter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a thought that it's not</v>

550
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 3>something that is structured with</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective reasoning.</v>

551
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's structured with</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own particular ideology that does</v>

552
00:27:55.111 --> 00:28:00.111
<v Speaker 3>not want to criticize this one segment</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the human population that they think</v>

553
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:05.151
<v Speaker 3>is being persecuted and meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about throughout currently</v>

554
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ideology persecutes the most</v>

555
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 3>number of other people.</v>

556
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 3>So if you talk about bloody borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

557
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Islam has fought with Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam fights with animists,</v>

558
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Islam fights with Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam fights with Christians.</v>

559
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Islam fights with the Beth and monks as</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

560
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.390
<v Speaker 3>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam doesn't necessarily make for very</v>

561
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.800
<v Speaker 3>good neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

562
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not withstanding the fact that most</v>

563
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Muslims are lovely and just want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>raise their kids Islam as a supremacist</v>

564
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it basically says that the world is</v>

565
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.390
<v Speaker 3>meant to all be united under the flag</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

566
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people take that seriously.</v>

567
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Others don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the doctrines of Islam are very</v>

568
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should all submit to Islam.</v>

569
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 3>So even if 95 percent of Muslims don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>adhere to that tenant,</v>

570
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 3>if only five percent do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means we're always going to have</v>

571
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:02.220
<v Speaker 3>friction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some cases it'll be like Lebanon.</v>

572
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've predicted that in Europe.</v>

573
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 3>This is on record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can probably find that that in Europe</v>

574
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:08.870
<v Speaker 3>within 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

575
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 years,</v>

576
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.530
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have Lebanon all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and now it's starting to happen.</v>

577
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one point we were having daily</v>

578
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 3>attacks all over Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

579
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to increase Islamic</v>

580
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 3>immigration to the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course most people are nice and just</v>

581
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:28.230
<v Speaker 3>want to escape through a better world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are you willing to take the risks</v>

582
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>for what's about to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you willing to accept people whose</v>

583
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 3>cultural and religious values are</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly antithetical to yours?</v>

584
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:40.971
<v Speaker 3>So example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do pew surveys from around the</v>

585
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Middle East or Islamic countries about</v>
<v Speaker 3>your views on Jews while you'll get</v>

586
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:49.390
<v Speaker 3>things like 95 to 99 percent Jew hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I am,</v>

587
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 3>if I am a Canadian Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

588
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>and I see that 50,000 Syrians are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come in,</v>

589
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 3>is it that I'm filled with hatred</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards Syrians or am I simply someone</v>

590
00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 3>who calculates statistical regularities</v>
<v Speaker 3>and basically says that out of 50,000</v>

591
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if 95 percent have academic Jew hatred</v>

592
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 3>as part of their identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I have a right to be concerned about</v>

593
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

594
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about Haitians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're black people.</v>

595
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about the Vietnamese.</v>

596
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about the cultural and</v>

597
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:21.810
<v Speaker 3>religious baggage that you bring in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about your views towards cliteracy</v>

598
00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:26.811
<v Speaker 3>as or homosexuality or a religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>minorities or black dogs?</v>

599
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Darwin forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a black dog,</v>

600
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 3>your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad hated dogs,</v>

601
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 3>but he particularly hated black dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

602
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do they do with blocked on the</v>

603
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go online and you'll see some pretty</v>

604
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:42.570
<v Speaker 3>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

605
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.890
<v Speaker 3>animal cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

606
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.250
<v Speaker 3>they're not very tolerant towards dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

607
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 3>if you touch a dog before you're heading</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prayer,</v>

608
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 3>this is called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in pure,</v>

609
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.280
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kuffar,</v>

610
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.630
<v Speaker 3>the non Muslims are also nudges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

611
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 3>They're there as impure as urine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood and sperm and feces,</v>

612
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.780
<v Speaker 3>so should I feel bad that there is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology that considers me an impure</v>

613
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 3>quality?</v>

614
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that all Muslims are like</v>

615
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course not.</v>

616
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Ninety nine percent of the Muslims I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>met have been lovely and many of them</v>

617
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 3>are my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we should be able to talk about</v>

618
00:31:18.701 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 3>what's inside those books and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>books are not radical Islam.</v>

619
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.830
<v Speaker 3>They're Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

620
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative like say for</v>

621
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Syrian refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean any kind,</v>

622
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:33.721
<v Speaker 3>caring person who has concern for our</v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow human beings sees these people</v>

623
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 3>fleeing and sees the horrific conditions</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're.</v>

624
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 3>That they're confronted with their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and they really don't have a lot</v>

625
00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 3>of options and they're trying to escape</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the west.</v>

626
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the options?</v>

627
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no clear answers.</v>

628
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:51.640
<v Speaker 3>I would certainly say you first place</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who are most at risk in those</v>

629
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:53.980
<v Speaker 3>societies on the front of the queue.</v>

630
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 3>So you bring the Yazidi women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll bring the Christians who are</v>

631
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:59.740
<v Speaker 3>being persecuted women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about the father?</v>

632
00:31:59.741 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>If the dad is with the wife and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

633
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:06.120
<v Speaker 3>you can't just have the father stayed</v>
<v Speaker 3>back behind the tent and you let the mom</v>

634
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.910
<v Speaker 3>go to Toronto with the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

635
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:08.763
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

636
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying though is that let</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are non Islamic who are</v>

637
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 3>fleeing those areas at the front of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>queue first,</v>

638
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that religious persecution?</v>

639
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at the very least it's prejudice,</v>

640
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

641
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're singling people out because of</v>

642
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 3>their ideology or because of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion they're from,</v>

643
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:32.920
<v Speaker 3>not because of their past behavior or</v>
<v Speaker 3>any predictors whatsoever about their</v>

644
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 3>future behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we do have some statistical</v>

645
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 3>irregularity about what types of values</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys are going to come with.</v>

646
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not suggesting we closed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

647
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

648
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 3>just to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't that in a way kind of put the</v>

649
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Muslims in Toronto who do immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would have picked that city who</v>

650
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 3>tried to immigrate to Canada in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a position that your family was</v>

651
00:32:56.901 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 3>in in Lebanon where you were hiding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that you would choose.</v>

652
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 3>No one has an inalienable right to</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrate anywhere.</v>

653
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you wish to immigrate to the West</v>

654
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.470
<v Speaker 3>than leave every single syllable that</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes a belief attitude,</v>

655
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.220
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>value that is contrary to ours at the</v>

656
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 3>door and then welcome in my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

657
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 3>isn't that a crazy thing to say to</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone whose entire life and their</v>

658
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 3>ideology is a big part of their identity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who they are,</v>

659
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 3>like how they view the world.</v>

660
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 3>So that's the structure for which they</v>
<v Speaker 3>interface with other human beings.</v>

661
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.980
<v Speaker 3>But if those values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's suppose that in a way I agree</v>

662
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:42.680
<v Speaker 3>with you overall when I talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire human population,</v>

663
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>that it would be wonderful if we did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

664
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 3>but from individual to individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know about the trials and</v>

665
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:52.190
<v Speaker 3>tribulations that people go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On a day to day life and religious</v>

666
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:57.191
<v Speaker 3>freedom and a religious ideology in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>cases helps people get through the pains</v>

667
00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:00.890
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps them get through the struggles.</v>

668
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's rational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am saying that in many ways it's a</v>

669
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding for their own personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

670
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to then ensure that your</v>

671
00:34:12.981 --> 00:34:17.981
<v Speaker 3>religious practice is exclusively</v>
<v Speaker 3>practice privately.</v>

672
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Never should there ever be an intrusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the public sphere.</v>

673
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asking for prayer rooms at the</v>

674
00:34:25.551 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The example that you gave is the slight</v>

675
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 3>creeping she had.</v>

676
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the slow.</v>

677
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:32.323
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

678
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 3>so my next book is called tentatively</v>
<v Speaker 3>might change death of the West by a</v>

679
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.251
<v Speaker 3>thousand cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

680
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 3>It's the idea that when you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

681
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 3>the parable of the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you put it in boiling water and you</v>

682
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 3>do it very slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frog,</v>

683
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Speaker 3>if you do it very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very slowly,</v>

684
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 3>if it falls below a just noticeable</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>

685
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't notice that the temperature</v>
<v Speaker 3>is rising until it's too late and it</v>

686
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:51.950
<v Speaker 3>boils to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

687
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of just noticeable</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference is something that's very</v>

688
00:34:55.251 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 3>important in this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to get Islam analyzed</v>

689
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:02.540
<v Speaker 3>overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Egypt before it became Islamic,</v>

690
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>used to be non Islamic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once upon a time.</v>

691
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Today it's about 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Coptic Christians,</v>

692
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Turkey is now 99 percent Islamic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day.</v>

693
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:13.960
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Great Persian empires were not</v>

694
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Islamic today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost exclusively Islamic.</v>

695
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 3>So the United States and Canada are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to become,</v>

696
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic,</v>

697
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

698
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:24.380
<v Speaker 3>in the next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But give it enough time,</v>

699
00:35:24.381 --> 00:35:29.381
<v Speaker 3>have a long enough view of history and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about your grandchildren and mine.</v>

700
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we,</v>

701
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 3>that's how you have an honest</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

702
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not sure what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One possibility which I've with folks on</v>

703
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>my</v>

704
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 4>show who are trained lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there are provisions in the law,</v>

705
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 4>at least in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the Claire and ideology as being</v>

706
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 4>suspicious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

707
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 4>So in the same way that you could say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Nazi-ism is seditious to our values</v>

708
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.700
<v Speaker 4>or communism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are elements of Islam.</v>

709
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 4>The nonspiritual parts that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>take Einstein to recognize that they are</v>

710
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.240
<v Speaker 4>perfectly antithetical to every single</v>
<v Speaker 4>value that you and I with the whole deer</v>

711
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 4>as Westerners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what?</v>

712
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 4>What would be some of those volumes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So take for example,</v>

713
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 4>Shetty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aloe,</v>

714
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the Islamic law by which you</v>

715
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.541
<v Speaker 4>organize society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first premise of Islamic law is that</v>

716
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:25.790
<v Speaker 4>the a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its severity and its punishment depends</v>

717
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 4>on the identity of the perpetrator and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the victim.</v>

718
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 4>So imagine the idea and the American</v>
<v Speaker 4>constitution that justice is blind.</v>

719
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is already violated as the most</v>

720
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:37.320
<v Speaker 4>fundamental tenets of Sharia law.</v>

721
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 4>If a Muslim kills a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

722
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 4>very different crime than if a Jew kills</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Muslim.</v>

723
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 4>You can just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go look up reliance of the traveler,</v>

724
00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:49.640
<v Speaker 4>which is the English translation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>shadow law.</v>

725
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And you'll see all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why should we tolerate this kind of</v>

726
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:54.580
<v Speaker 4>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

727
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Come in my Muslim brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but keep the stuff that you yourself</v>

728
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.860
<v Speaker 4>escaped from out of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want it.</v>

729
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.700
<v Speaker 4>And if you keep it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come in and let's grow together and hug</v>

730
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why should I be tolerant towards the</v>

731
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:09.730
<v Speaker 4>intolerable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

732
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.390
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the problem is as soon as</v>

733
00:37:13.391 --> 00:37:17.200
<v Speaker 5>you tell someone to not follow certain</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects of their ideology,</v>

734
00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:20.680
<v Speaker 5>those aspects become even more</v>
<v Speaker 5>attractive and especially if they</v>

735
00:37:20.681 --> 00:37:25.270
<v Speaker 5>consider the west to be decadent and</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled with sin and fornicating and</v>

736
00:37:25.271 --> 00:37:28.240
<v Speaker 5>drinking and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the things that they think are</v>

737
00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:31.450
<v Speaker 5>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then these people are the ones who</v>

738
00:37:31.451 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 5>are telling you that you can't follow</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word of God has brought down by the</v>

739
00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:40.840
<v Speaker 5>profit from up on high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It becomes even more attractive to them.</v>

740
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.930
<v Speaker 5>So what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's your truck's psychedelic</v>

741
00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:46.330
<v Speaker 5>drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone gets on mushrooms and I'm not</v>

742
00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.310
<v Speaker 5>kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really.</v>

743
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.960
<v Speaker 5>I really think you need transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences to escape from the day to</v>

744
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:57.760
<v Speaker 5>day vibration of normal life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about just the commitment to reason</v>

745
00:37:57.761 --> 00:37:59.800
<v Speaker 5>and science?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be wonderful if we could do</v>

746
00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:02.380
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people are so terrified of death and</v>

747
00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:06.580
<v Speaker 5>they're so terrified of the unknown and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so terrified of not having</v>

748
00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People love having ideological structure</v>

749
00:38:10.511 --> 00:38:13.210
<v Speaker 5>that they can govern their life by real</v>
<v Speaker 5>clear,</v>

750
00:38:13.211 --> 00:38:14.680
<v Speaker 5>established rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

751
00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:17.890
<v Speaker 5>People get mad at me when I wear a fanny</v>
<v Speaker 5>pack and I'm not joking.</v>

752
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:21.550
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why where it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people think it's disgusting.</v>

753
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Like you think it's disgusting that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>will have a bag around my waist that I</v>

754
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 5>can keep my keys and phone in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

755
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.350
<v Speaker 5>but we have structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

756
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.350
<v Speaker 5>men aren't supposed to wear sandals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

757
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:35.140
<v Speaker 5>if you're a man and you're wearing high</v>
<v Speaker 5>heels open toed,</v>

758
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 5>you will get</v>

759
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 3>ridiculed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

760
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Because we have a structure and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

761
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:39.551
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

762
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really because it's along</v>

763
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:47.881
<v Speaker 3>the same lines of thinking that we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect you to behave like we do so that</v>

764
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to worry about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

765
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I like gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like a man with a tie and a suit</v>

766
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:57.610
<v Speaker 3>because I'm pretty sure that guy's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to spit at me and stab me and rob</v>

767
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have these ideas about people that</v>

768
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 3>dress and behave a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

769
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a business meeting and the</v>

770
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 3>guy starts swearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll like,</v>

771
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I all bets are off.</v>

772
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 3>This man's not establishing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman's protocol.</v>

773
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 3>He's not following the standard business</v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented,</v>

774
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just like to exchange numbers</v>

775
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 3>and funds with you protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I don't understand what his</v>

776
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 3>behavior is going to be.</v>

777
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 3>He's unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could be a random street thug with a</v>

778
00:39:25.691 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 3>hoodie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

779
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 3>that was a thing for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were scared of young black men</v>

780
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 3>with hoodies on because a gentleman</v>
<v Speaker 3>would not wear a hoodie on the street.</v>

781
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

782
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Our brains have evolved to think this</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

783
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this idea,</v>

784
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:42.500
<v Speaker 3>you were asking me earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me some examples of ostrich logic.</v>

785
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:46.660
<v Speaker 3>So this kind of Hashtag not all right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

786
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>That again is idiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

787
00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Because when we think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not talk about Islam for a second.</v>

788
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 3>If you're going down a dark alley and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see for young men,</v>

789
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:58.840
<v Speaker 3>forget about hoodies and pants down just</v>
<v Speaker 3>for young men.</v>

790
00:39:58.841 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 3>So all you have described is the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're young and they're men.</v>

791
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 3>If you see for young men versus four</v>
<v Speaker 3>elderly women just because of your</v>

792
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 3>statistical regularity that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculate,</v>

793
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 3>which is more which group is more likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to end violence on you,</v>

794
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.680
<v Speaker 3>then you might avoid the alley with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>four young men,</v>

795
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.080
<v Speaker 3>even though not all young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

796
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Even though the probability that a young</v>
<v Speaker 3>man is going to jump you and gang rape</v>

797
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 3>you and Mug you and stab you as a small</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

798
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 3>but your brain has evolved to calculate</v>
<v Speaker 3>those statistical regularities and to</v>

799
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:35.500
<v Speaker 3>then be very careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be very risk averse and putting yourself</v>

800
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 3>in harm's way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

801
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 3>even though most Muslims are very nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very lovely,</v>

802
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I think we have enough data right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we look at the last since 2000,</v>

803
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:47.500
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>

804
00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:51.460
<v Speaker 3>one nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been over 30,000 terror attacks</v>

805
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 3>committed in the name of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

806
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 3>I challenge anybody in your comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>section to list me another ideology that</v>

807
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>comes remotely close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you added up every single other</v>

808
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:05.020
<v Speaker 3>ideology since 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't come up to 100.</v>

809
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 3>So what is the statistical numbers that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to see before you're able to</v>

810
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.080
<v Speaker 3>simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

811
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 3>let's have an honest conversation.</v>

812
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Not withstanding that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all Muslims and most are nice.</v>

813
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Is there a problem with Islam?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

814
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not radical Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not Islam Islam.</v>

815
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not militant violent extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop with the bullshit euphemisms.</v>

816
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 3>There are inherent elements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contents within Islam that are</v>

817
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 3>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not my job to find a way to get rid</v>

818
00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you wish to be part of our</v>

819
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:37.970
<v Speaker 3>western societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you need to find the way to expunge</v>

820
00:41:37.971 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do it,</v>

821
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.480
<v Speaker 3>welcome my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all brothers.</v>

822
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I should show preference to people</v>

823
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.800
<v Speaker 3>who share similar cultural values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that's.</v>

824
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 3>That's called survival instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what about people that would say</v>

825
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 3>that there's inherent problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish religion?</v>

826
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 3>There's inherent problems with</v>
<v Speaker 3>subscribing to that ideology that there</v>

827
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 3>had been persecuting Islamic people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palestine that they've been prosecuting</v>

828
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 3>and treating Islamic people as inferior</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Jewish people.</v>

829
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not necessarily saying it,</v>

830
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 3>but that's all part of ostrich logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I call the Crusades.</v>

831
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not me who actually came up</v>

832
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

833
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 3>So every time we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more like,</v>

834
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:21.074
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

835
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a way of saying like,</v>

836
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 3>but bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about the Crusades,</v>

837
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Amal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

838
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Where's that from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I first saw it and he'll be</v>

839
00:42:29.691 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 3>happy that I'm giving a shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a guy on youtube who goes by the</v>

840
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 3>name of t and crowds or Kraut and t,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a German youtuber.</v>

841
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

842
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I meant like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not from a language or anything.</v>

843
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.021
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

844
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:42.231
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

845
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:43.310
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying,</v>

846
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's Duh,</v>

847
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:44.991
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

848
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

849
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Crusades,</v>

850
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.070
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

851
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you point to some Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly reality than someone points,</v>

852
00:42:54.771 --> 00:42:56.970
<v Speaker 3>but bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about Israel but isn't ended up</v>

853
00:42:56.971 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 3>valid comparison?</v>

854
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're kind of claiming and</v>

855
00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:01.290
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

856
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.091
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

857
00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 3>but when you're saying you're Jewish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support you saying this 100 percent,</v>

858
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 3>especially considering of all people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be in some ways proud of who</v>

859
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:14.810
<v Speaker 3>you are considering that you come from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>line of oppressed people that escaped a</v>

860
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 3>horrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A no one is arguing that there is a</v>

861
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 3>monopoly of ugliness that only stems</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Islam.</v>

862
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Jews can engage in ugliness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians,</v>

863
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 3>atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why subscribed to any ideology then?</v>

864
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Because in the case of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about specifically</v>

865
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

866
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.590
<v Speaker 3>any ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any.</v>

867
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a land,</v>

868
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 3>but I reject all the religious elements</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Judaism,</v>

869
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:44.010
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why are you a Jew?</v>

870
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Because I am part of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are part of a shared history,</v>

871
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.930
<v Speaker 3>so it's like I'm Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your attack kind of thing.</v>

872
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 3>You're a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

873
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I belong to the lineage.</v>

874
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>And the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

875
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I recently put up a clip on my channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I talked about academic lineage.</v>

876
00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:03.990
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way that you could build</v>
<v Speaker 3>a genealogy of your family tree or of a</v>

877
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 3>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do what's called an academic</v>

878
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 3>genealogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

879
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.880
<v Speaker 3>my doctoral supervisor is my academic</v>
<v Speaker 3>father and then I could look to see who</v>

880
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 3>was his academic supervisor and who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>his academic supervisor and do the</v>

881
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.240
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

882
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct lineage.</v>

883
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 3>So I could literally go back to some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the founders and only three or four</v>

884
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 3>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

885
00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 3>with some of the pioneers of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychology.</v>

886
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.650
<v Speaker 3>And so I belong to that particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe,</v>

887
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes to academia when it comes to my</v>

888
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to my religious heritage.</v>

889
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I belong to a group called Jews.</v>

890
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean that all the Booga</v>
<v Speaker 3>Booga bullshit in Judaism I buy into,</v>

891
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes me already somewhat less</v>

892
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.420
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if there are any ugly elements</v>

893
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:50.280
<v Speaker 3>within Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're simply not going to be</v>

894
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 3>instantiated because I'm openly</v>
<v Speaker 3>rejecting all that shit.</v>

895
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that you as an individual</v>

896
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.560
<v Speaker 3>or me as an individual and most Jews in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the west,</v>

897
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I think would fit into my category by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

898
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 3>later we should talk about four and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half hour talk I had with a Hasid,</v>

899
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 3>a very religious Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it flying ticket to California</v>

900
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 3>on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

901
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 3>if most Muslims said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

902
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 3>there's tons of historical elements in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic societies that's beautiful.</v>

903
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Islamic architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic Science,</v>

904
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Islamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic Science,</v>

905
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:25.390
<v Speaker 3>some Islamic philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

906
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 3>one of the first intellectuals and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern history,</v>

907
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.760
<v Speaker 3>big history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so so I could be Muslim and that I come</v>

908
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 3>from a shared lineage of people and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be very proud of that,</v>

909
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 3>but I can also have the moral compass</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the moral fortitude to say,</v>

910
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:45.480
<v Speaker 3>but there is stuff in my book that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly grotesque and no amount of</v>

911
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:50.481
<v Speaker 3>obfuscation and re interpretive dancing</v>
<v Speaker 3>could alter that ugliness,</v>

912
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

913
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to take kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill,</v>

914
00:45:52.591 --> 00:45:53.101
<v Speaker 3>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill,</v>

915
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 3>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken a suppressor outbreak,</v>

916
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 3>resume killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no way to take that and</v>

917
00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 3>reinterpreted using modern sensibilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>to mean at killing with caresses,</v>

918
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not play this reform game,</v>

919
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:09.230
<v Speaker 3>so be proud of your cultural identity if</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if that incorporates an Islamic</v>

920
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:13.650
<v Speaker 3>identity grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but reject all the bullshit.</v>

921
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's where Judaism and</v>

922
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Christianity at this point is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from Islam.</v>

923
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 3>For most people who are Islamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they don't necessarily believe</v>

924
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll feel very reticent to openly</v>

925
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 3>admitted that they despise a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugliness they'll say it's not true.</v>

926
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't understand that.</v>

927
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 3>You misinterpreted that Reza Aslan</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit,</v>

928
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

929
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Speaker 3>be honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it exists.</v>

930
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Say you're rejected and let's move</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

931
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 3>but stop skating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then there's people like Majid</v>

932
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Nawaz who has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he identifies as being a Muslim,</v>

933
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 3>but he does reject those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he says that you could reform them</v>

934
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 3>and measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have had in case some of you</v>

935
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 3>viewers don't know this.</v>

936
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I invited at one point two four to chat</v>

937
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

938
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.460
<v Speaker 3>he refused because I think he refused</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

939
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I can't put intent into his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm analyzing his rejection to chat</v>

940
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because he sees that I'm</v>

941
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 3>going to call them out on a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative.</v>

942
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knows why someone rejects.</v>

943
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he openly rejected?</v>

944
00:47:21.991 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Like he has no room for it in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

945
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.760
<v Speaker 3>whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

946
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point I retract that invitation.</v>

947
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 3>So even if you want it to run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an expression in Arabic.</v>

948
00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use this for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine this is the pen.</v>

949
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 3>He's holding a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

950
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm holding the people at home</v>

951
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of guys listening.</v>

952
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This spend,</v>

953
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 3>we're a cork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cork of a wine bottle.</v>

954
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 3>There's an expression in Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'll say in Arabic.</v>

955
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Some people have heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned before.</v>

956
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.940
<v Speaker 3>The expression is this guy to bill's bb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Discardable is bb is to get drunk simply</v>

957
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.250
<v Speaker 3>by smelling the court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

958
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 3>So I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm smelling it.</v>

959
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm already getting drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what measured in there was his,</v>

960
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

961
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 3>he gets people drunk with his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

962
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 3>hopeful reform message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds so liberal.</v>

963
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 3>That sounds so hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say the expression of this scheduled</v>

964
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:13.763
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

965
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't even make that noise in my face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that this schedule booths but like,</v>

966
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.710
<v Speaker 3>but like Yanni.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

967
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:22.563
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

968
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.160
<v Speaker 3>do you want me to have the rest of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in Arabic be fascinating.</v>

969
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds cool.</v>

970
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens with a lot of the guests</v>

971
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 3>that I bring in on my show who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabic,</v>

972
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:39.300
<v Speaker 3>we always start off the star of our show</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking only in Arabic because for most</v>

973
00:48:39.611 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 3>westerners it's fetishize.</v>

974
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

975
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.540
<v Speaker 3>oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so alien to the way you speak</v>

976
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.900
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sounds right,</v>

977
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>but so going back to magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what maybe his heart is in the</v>

978
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:52.750
<v Speaker 3>right place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

979
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to infer or imply that</v>

980
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 3>he's diabolical are duplicitous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably truly believes that</v>

981
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.840
<v Speaker 3>he's doing something worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that it's not as though</v>

982
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.220
<v Speaker 3>until measured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The West came along.</v>

983
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 3>No one had ever thought about this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reforming Islam.</v>

984
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Jesus really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never thought of that in the last</v>

985
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 3>1400 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is that there are</v>

986
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 3>elements within the doctrines of Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>that simply don't permit for this</v>

987
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 3>reformation to take place and even if it</v>
<v Speaker 3>could take place,</v>

988
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 3>we don't necessarily have the time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait another 400 years while we</v>

989
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 3>deliberate how each syllable and each of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problematic passages should be</v>

990
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:38.500
<v Speaker 3>reinterpreted while people spot are</v>
<v Speaker 3>being stacked up all over the world and</v>

991
00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 3>so therefore I think that there needs to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a much more direct intervention and</v>

992
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:45.490
<v Speaker 3>what I mean by direct intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

993
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.460
<v Speaker 3>there doesn't need to be reformed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't need to be interpreted.</v>

994
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 3>It needs to be expunged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These types of ideas.</v>

995
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:56.910
<v Speaker 3>If Judaism has certain ideas that are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>belligerent to women's cliteracy,</v>

996
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:02.550
<v Speaker 3>then I want those ideas and Judaism out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't belong in the public arena of</v>

997
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

998
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did Christianity reform and Islam</v>

999
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.960
<v Speaker 3>did not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did that go about happening?</v>

1000
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Because at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

1001
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Christianity was a very repressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and the apostasy,</v>

1002
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 3>the idea of it was much more oppressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>than today.</v>

1003
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Islam is the only religion that I'm</v>

1004
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:25.991
<v Speaker 3>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1005
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's more that I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorant to where if you leave the</v>

1006
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 3>religion they can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1007
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

1008
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what God wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God wants you to die because you don't</v>

1009
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 3>believe in them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1010
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I've always said that Islam is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect meme of plex.</v>

1011
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>So are you familiar with that term</v>
<v Speaker 3>means?</v>

1012
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a meme is a term that Richard Dawkins</v>

1013
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.280
<v Speaker 3>coined in his book in 1976.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Selfish,</v>

1014
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 3>selfish gene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1015
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was analogizing the idea of a</v>

1016
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 3>gene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gene's propagate,</v>

1017
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.700
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1018
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 3>memes are packets of information that</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread from one brain to another.</v>

1019
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And so means also spread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are both a biological and a cultural</v>

1020
00:51:07.491 --> 00:51:08.324
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1021
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Both are gene spread and our ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread.</v>

1022
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:14.840
<v Speaker 3>So a meme is something that can go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you read my books,</v>

1023
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 3>I am infecting your brain with my memes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my ideas.</v>

1024
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A library is a collection of memes.</v>

1025
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Mima.</v>

1026
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Plex is a collection of means that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this case falls under a religious idea.</v>

1027
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1028
00:51:28.711 --> 00:51:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Islam is the perfect Mimo plex in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense?</v>

1029
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 3>And that it's contents are made to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread.</v>

1030
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism.</v>

1031
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned earlier Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any Jews there are in the</v>

1032
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:40.574
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1033
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.150
<v Speaker 3>John spot 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1034
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1035
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to ask you what you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just not to put you on the spot.</v>

1036
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many?</v>

1037
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Seven billion people in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would guess there would be somewhere</v>

1038
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 3>in the neighborhood of a billion Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A billion.</v>

1039
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:56.811
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1040
00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:59.030
<v Speaker 3>you want to take $500?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million maybe.</v>

1041
00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a very conservative</v>

1042
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:01.950
<v Speaker 3>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

1043
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Change it to 500 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad that we did this.</v>

1044
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be shocked how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is somewhere between 13 to 15</v>

1045
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 3>million Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is more than that in New York.</v>

1046
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Now you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just look it up.</v>

1047
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Shut the off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skype talking crazy.</v>

1048
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.090
<v Speaker 3>He's an agent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let let,</v>

1049
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.530
<v Speaker 3>let.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Zionist shell.</v>

1050
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1051
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 3>let Jamie now do his little google</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic.</v>

1052
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen to $15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million.</v>

1053
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.980
<v Speaker 3>$50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million.</v>

1054
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.280
<v Speaker 3>There's more idiots in America than</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are Jews and that's only an</v>

1055
00:52:28.281 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry guys.</v>

1056
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really it?</v>

1057
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how many Nobel Prize winners</v>

1058
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:40.250
<v Speaker 3>are Jews and 25 to 30 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible,</v>

1059
00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1060
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.283
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1061
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 3>some people will say there is a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>element,</v>

1062
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.330
<v Speaker 3>but even if here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we got?</v>

1063
00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Fourteen dollars million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,000.</v>

1064
00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Between 30 and $50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's perfectly accurate.</v>

1065
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Speaker 3>What is the enlarged?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1066
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:58.430
<v Speaker 3>The world most?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most.</v>

1067
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 3>The largest number of possibles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million.</v>

1068
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 3>You know that's like given I've never</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen 20 million.</v>

1069
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 3>It's usually the highest I've seen is 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

1070
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.270
<v Speaker 3>It says core Jewish and and large</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish.</v>

1071
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 3>What does that like dudes will get</v>
<v Speaker 3>converted because their wife makes him.</v>

1072
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uncle did that,</v>

1073
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:15.283
<v Speaker 3>but by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

1074
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.360
<v Speaker 3>by strict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by strictly conversion allows that would</v>

1075
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 3>not be allowed and not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>convert for ulterior motives.</v>

1076
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alternative motives?</v>

1077
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a spiritual awakening.</v>

1078
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went through the whole process.</v>

1079
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 3>He went to Hebrew school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole process has to be for no</v>

1080
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 3>ulterior motive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be because my wife would not</v>

1081
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:35.810
<v Speaker 3>marry me otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he did it because she wanted</v>

1082
00:53:35.811 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 3>him to do and then he decided to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was what,</v>

1083
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1084
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1085
00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.970
<v Speaker 3>let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are,</v>

1086
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:48.140
<v Speaker 3>there are about 13 to 15 million Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are one point 6 billion Muslims,</v>

1087
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 3>one fifth of humanity to every one Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 100 Muslim.</v>

1088
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Which ideology is more successful based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on propagation,</v>

1089
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Judaism.</v>

1090
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1091
00:54:02.731 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1092
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:06.610
<v Speaker 3>take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversion laws for,</v>

1093
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.250
<v Speaker 3>as you said about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it your cousin?</v>

1094
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uncle,</v>

1095
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:10.760
<v Speaker 3>my uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1096
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 3>in the way that he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>

1097
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a very assiduous process.</v>

1098
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time before and as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter of fact,</v>

1099
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:23.160
<v Speaker 3>the rabbis are supposed to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissuade you from converting to Judaism</v>

1100
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 3>because that in a sense tests your</v>
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>

1101
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 3>your desire to change an Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what you have to do to</v>

1102
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 3>convert?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1103
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.590
<v Speaker 3>I won't say it because if I actually say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in Arabic,</v>

1104
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 3>that converted converted and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I leave it,</v>

1105
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 3>but basically you just have to say the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shahada,</v>

1106
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>which it's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I testify,</v>

1107
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a once one sentence and then that's</v>

1108
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.240
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom ran.</v>

1109
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 3>If you leave your dead in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't that.</v>

1110
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:52.920
<v Speaker 3>How about laws?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laws for marriage.</v>

1111
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 3>A Muslim man can marry up to four women</v>
<v Speaker 3>including non Muslim women and convert</v>

1112
00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a Muslim woman cannot do the other</v>

1113
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 3>way around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the whole structure of Islam is built</v>

1114
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 3>on the propagation of the belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just by that,</v>

1115
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 3>which one is going to be more dangerous?</v>

1116
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>One is a proselytizing religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one you're not allowed to in</v>

1117
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Judaism to proselytize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to try to convert</v>

1118
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:23.721
<v Speaker 3>others and Islam is to proselytize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to now in different countries,</v>

1119
00:55:25.711 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 3>they'll do it in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the West where they are in the</v>

1120
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 3>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do it through interfaith</v>

1121
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.560
<v Speaker 3>exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the interfaith exchanges are always</v>

1122
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 3>the Muslim telling the non Muslim how</v>
<v Speaker 3>great our religion is and why you should</v>

1123
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 3>convert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never.</v>

1124
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 3>It's never given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a.</v>

1125
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.820
<v Speaker 3>So just going back to your early point</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Israel and so on.</v>

1126
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.871
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1127
00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Undoubtedly there are some Israelis that</v>
<v Speaker 3>do very bad things to their non Jewish</v>

1128
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No question.</v>

1129
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 3>But when we're talking about existential</v>
<v Speaker 3>threats to our western ways,</v>

1130
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 3>you and I probably don't stay up</v>
<v Speaker 3>worrying about radical Jews.</v>

1131
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:01.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1132
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.120
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1133
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what it is about people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes us so susceptible to ideological</v>

1134
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:14.241
<v Speaker 3>thinking and still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether or not it's ever expungeable</v>

1135
00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's ever something that</v>

1136
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 3>we can eradicate from the thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1137
00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 3>It just seems inherent to being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1138
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 3>So much so that I recognize it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

1139
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a perfect example.</v>

1140
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I ran into a guy just a few days ago and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

1141
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.960
<v Speaker 5>he said hello to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he explained to me that he</v>

1142
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:36.310
<v Speaker 5>trains Jujitsu with the Machados and</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately we were like brothers</v>

1143
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.230
<v Speaker 5>because that's my lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1144
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.540
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1145
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:42.580
<v Speaker 5>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like immediately.</v>

1146
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is so weird.</v>

1147
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.120
<v Speaker 5>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1148
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand like when I talk to someone</v>

1149
00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 5>like how long you train?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twelve years.</v>

1150
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:51.971
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1151
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 5>So you understand me and I understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1152
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where do you,</v>

1153
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 5>where do you train Machado's Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we come from the same thing.</v>

1154
00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:58.951
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>

1155
00:56:58.951 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 5>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a weird thing.</v>

1156
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 5>Like I'd give that guy a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know him.</v>

1157
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

1158
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 5>that's the case with religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the case with,</v>

1159
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.110
<v Speaker 5>with many things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the case with ethnic ethnicities.</v>

1160
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:16.320
<v Speaker 5>Oftentimes with even with state pride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we branch off into groups and we</v>

1161
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:22.420
<v Speaker 5>have micro groups and macro groups and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets real weird when we do this,</v>

1162
00:57:22.421 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 5>but we all do it.</v>

1163
00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:28.580
<v Speaker 4>So to speak exactly about this ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>granular way to compare it to</v>

1164
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:33.000
<v Speaker 4>compartmentalize us versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me mention the Hasidic.</v>

1165
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please do.</v>

1166
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Because the reason I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that's a good segue is</v>

1167
00:57:39.031 --> 00:57:41.580
<v Speaker 4>because I actually raised it with him on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plane.</v>

1168
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.930
<v Speaker 4>I used to live in an area in Montreal</v>
<v Speaker 4>called Mall for the Montreal is out</v>

1169
00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:46.711
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll know where it is,</v>

1170
00:57:46.711 --> 00:57:51.711
<v Speaker 4>where there are a lot of acidic Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now you would think that within this</v>

1171
00:57:51.721 --> 00:57:56.160
<v Speaker 4>very small group of people called Jews</v>
<v Speaker 4>within an even smaller group of people</v>

1172
00:57:56.161 --> 00:58:00.140
<v Speaker 4>called Hasidic Orthodox Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you're an Orthodox Jew,</v>

1173
00:58:00.141 --> 00:58:01.740
<v Speaker 4>you're an Orthodox Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1174
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.920
<v Speaker 4>on this side of the street are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Polish Orthodox Jews on this side of the</v>

1175
00:58:07.171 --> 00:58:12.171
<v Speaker 4>street are the Hungarian Orthodox Jews</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wouldn't be caught dead marrying</v>

1176
00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 4>my daughter to those heathen pigs from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other side of the street.</v>

1177
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.520
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our ability to create a US versus them</v>

1178
00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:22.280
<v Speaker 4>distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you said is,</v>

1179
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.060
<v Speaker 4>is infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

1180
00:58:24.061 --> 00:58:26.460
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate most about religion and not only</v>

1181
00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:27.294
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1182
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Certainly every abrahamic religion has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very clear delineation between us and</v>

1183
00:58:32.581 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1184
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.300
<v Speaker 4>if we are Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have in the rest of you</v>

1185
00:58:36.301 --> 00:58:39.480
<v Speaker 4>who haven't accepted Jesus are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell if you are Jewish,</v>

1186
00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.520
<v Speaker 4>they are the Jews and they are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>goals,</v>

1187
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the gentiles.</v>

1188
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.740
<v Speaker 4>If you are Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course there are US Muslim believers</v>

1189
00:58:46.741 --> 00:58:48.660
<v Speaker 4>and all of you could fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1190
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.930
<v Speaker 4>And so it's an inherent part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abrahamic faith to play on this very</v>

1191
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:56.700
<v Speaker 4>innate mechanism of tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>US versus them.</v>

1192
00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 4>It's grotesque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also what happened in Iraq when</v>

1193
00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:01.134
<v Speaker 4>we</v>

1194
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.490
<v Speaker 5>got rid of Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it created a civil war between two rival</v>

1195
00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:08.040
<v Speaker 5>factions of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shia and the Sunni,</v>

1196
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.910
<v Speaker 5>which most people had no idea that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>even a situation over there.</v>

1197
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.180
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1198
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.730
<v Speaker 4>But should we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk?</v>

1199
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>So I was very interested in asking him</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I actually thought about</v>

1200
00:59:22.131 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 4>studying scientifically as part of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>

1201
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that I study as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1202
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:27.740
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1203
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 4>I apply evolutionary psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things.</v>

1204
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 4>One of which is mating preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1205
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 4>are there certain mating preferences</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are universally true irrespective</v>

1206
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:37.640
<v Speaker 4>of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1207
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 4>And the answer of course is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whether you go to the Animal Momo</v>

1208
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 4>tribe in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a closed society,</v>

1209
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 4>or you go walk around in La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are certain things that men will</v>

1210
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 4>look for in women and other things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>women will look for.</v>

1211
00:59:48.921 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 4>And men that tend to be universal's for</v>
<v Speaker 4>clear evolutionary reasons.</v>

1212
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 4>So I was interested at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 4>studying the mating preferences of the</v>

1213
00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Hasidic community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1214
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 4>the idea being that here you're taking a</v>
<v Speaker 4>community that culturally and</v>

1215
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:06.560
<v Speaker 4>religiously is very close where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural and religious brainwashing is</v>

1216
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very strong.</v>

1217
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 4>And in this moment is movement that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're making with your hands.</v>

1218
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Does that represent the sheet with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hole in it as you're doing this thing?</v>

1219
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Keeps doing this thing with your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Must Be.</v>

1220
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:20.530
<v Speaker 4>It must be a subconscious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1221
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Is that a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's real.</v>

1222
01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm adding her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might be the ostrich thing.</v>

1223
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.570
<v Speaker 4>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a,</v>

1224
01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 4>it's a find out if we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>explaining what we're talking about,</v>

1225
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.560
<v Speaker 4>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that when a hasidic couple</v>

1226
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:36.080
<v Speaker 4>has sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a sheet between them where</v>

1227
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 4>they make a hole where the genitalia</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes and that's how you get it all.</v>

1228
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 4>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why you kept doing that.</v>

1229
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was a freudian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1230
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.040
<v Speaker 4>and so my idea was at one point is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if I can get access to the Hasidic</v>

1231
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:53.390
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which will probably not be easy to get</v>

1232
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Speaker 4>into the Hasidic community and ask them</v>
<v Speaker 4>about their mating preferences.</v>

1233
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.610
<v Speaker 4>And so it was a small idea I had over an</v>
<v Speaker 4>afternoon and then kind of dropped it</v>

1234
01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 4>and moved on to other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here I was sitting with a couple of</v>

1235
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 4>hesitant couple and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1236
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't do a scientific study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least I could come up with some</v>

1237
01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 4>anecdotes to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I actually asked them things</v>

1238
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:14.240
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1239
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you,</v>

1240
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 4>can we talk about some meeting</v>
<v Speaker 4>preferences that take place within the</v>

1241
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 4>Hasidic community?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there were some really incredible</v>

1242
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 4>insights that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1243
01:01:22.071 --> 01:01:25.490
<v Speaker 4>the Wa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wife said that one of the attributes</v>

1244
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 4>that she absolutely was looking for an</v>
<v Speaker 4>it perspective made was that he be</v>

1245
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.400
<v Speaker 4>taller than her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1246
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out that this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is called assortative mating.</v>

1247
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Birds of a feather flock together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at naturally occurring</v>

1248
01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 4>couples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is almost never the case that the</v>

1249
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:42.950
<v Speaker 4>woman is taller than the man.</v>

1250
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 4>There was actually a study done with 720</v>
<v Speaker 4>couples as single couple.</v>

1251
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 4>The woman was taller than the men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's an example of a very basic</v>

1252
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 4>physical desire and this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just need the map not not to be tall,</v>

1253
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.950
<v Speaker 4>just taller than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1254
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.000
<v Speaker 4>That was replicating in a completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>different context.</v>

1255
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And the Hasidic community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even asked them about things like,</v>

1256
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll a hasidic woman ever look at a non</v>

1257
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Hasidic guy that's walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 4>street of bad boy that has tattoos and</v>

1258
01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:18.371
<v Speaker 4>greased back here and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the swimmer's body and desire him or has</v>

1259
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 4>the cultural</v>

1260
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.520
<v Speaker 3>and religious brainwashing been so great</v>
<v Speaker 3>that her eyes are shut off to these</v>

1261
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 3>possibilities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she actually said that.</v>

1262
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the bottom line as Eo Wilson</v>

1263
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jeans hold culture on a leash.</v>

1264
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much cultural and</v>

1265
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:41.790
<v Speaker 3>religious brainwashing you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you scratch far enough,</v>

1266
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 3>you'll get the same human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I basically got from my</v>

1267
01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating way of describing</v>

1268
01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The genes hold culture,</v>

1269
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.720
<v Speaker 3>lead shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>

1270
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Well that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the o Wilson.</v>

1271
01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfect way of saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a nice.</v>

1272
01:02:56.841 --> 01:02:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then you hear a phrase and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1273
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.620
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1274
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1275
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:00.993
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1276
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I wish you could get him on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if he's now probably 85.</v>

1277
01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you know who Eo Wilson is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1278
01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So eo Wilson is a very famous,</v>

1279
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>a scientist at Harvard.</v>

1280
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I've heard the name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know.</v>

1281
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's amazing.</v>

1282
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a by training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an entomologist,</v>

1283
01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 3>a insect scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He specifically studies,</v>

1284
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social social ants basically.</v>

1285
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And so he looks at things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>reciprocal altruism,</v>

1286
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:33.900
<v Speaker 3>kin selection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these mechanisms of altruism in</v>

1287
01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 3>the context of b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another quote that he has that I</v>

1288
01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:39.990
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communism slash socialism,</v>

1289
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.720
<v Speaker 3>great system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong species.</v>

1290
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:48.030
<v Speaker 3>What he's basically saying is that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>political system of we're all equal</v>

1291
01:03:48.031 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 3>under communism is a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it applies to social ants that</v>

1292
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:54.070
<v Speaker 3>doesn't apply to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1293
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.900
<v Speaker 3>So he's got these wonderful pithy</v>
<v Speaker 3>quotes.</v>

1294
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that Robert Sapolsky is</v>

1295
01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if Robert Sapolsky is great,</v>

1296
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you need to get Eo Wilson on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast and.</v>

1297
01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Well if it's possible I'll look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did you say he is?</v>

1298
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 3>He's at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard.</v>

1299
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 3>So I'd probably have to come to him.</v>

1300
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Product Daddy travels a lot at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

1301
01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 3>It was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'd be willing.</v>

1302
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be back there eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1303
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 3>So how often do you go back to Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I haven't been in awhile.</v>

1304
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try and get there in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spring.</v>

1305
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about filming my next</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix special there was before I</v>

1306
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:28.921
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1307
01:04:28.921 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to figure it out.</v>

1308
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 3>It's either going to be there here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1309
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those was my two options.</v>

1310
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Boston or California?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very nice.</v>

1311
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Seven figure either my current or</v>
<v Speaker 3>former.</v>

1312
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1313
01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1314
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 3>so when you talk to this guy for four</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus hours,</v>

1315
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my,</v>

1316
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.310
<v Speaker 3>my wife was pissed by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1317
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Because you didn't talk to her because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she felt ignored.</v>

1318
01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:54.240
<v Speaker 3>She felt like she was getting bored and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she have to take care of the kids while</v>

1319
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I was having this one is my fight.</v>

1320
01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I thought later winter it had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful if we could have taped it and</v>

1321
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I could have released this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my show.</v>

1322
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was so honest to keep in</v>

1323
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 3>touch with this guy and so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we exchange actually asked him</v>

1324
01:05:08.881 --> 01:05:09.380
<v Speaker 3>permission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1325
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mention that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned.</v>

1326
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you mind,</v>

1327
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm going on this very popular showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you?</v>

1328
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:14.931
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1329
01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and feel free.</v>

1330
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And so it would be cool to get you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and moderate.</v>

1331
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:20.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be cool.</v>

1332
01:05:20.871 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1333
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:23.254
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1334
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 3>it was an amicable conversation and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>really pushed him very politely.</v>

1335
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at one point I said to him,</v>

1336
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:32.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be the evidence that you</v>

1337
01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:37.531
<v Speaker 3>would need to see to have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>questioning of your faith and his</v>

1338
01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 3>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a classic argument from the,</v>

1339
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know the term God of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gaps.</v>

1340
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Are you familiar with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God of the gaps is basically at one</v>

1341
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 3>point when we didn't know much in</v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1342
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 3>God could be found explaining everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1343
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Why does it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1344
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 3>God does it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We find out that there is a very clear</v>

1345
01:05:58.271 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 3>material explanation for for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightening.</v>

1346
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:06.310
<v Speaker 3>So now that's often how God goes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hide somewhere else and now he</v>

1347
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:11.370
<v Speaker 3>constantly finds the small gaps where</v>
<v Speaker 3>science hasn't yet been able to uncover</v>

1348
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:14.740
<v Speaker 3>an explanation and he hides there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called the god of the gaps</v>

1349
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:18.590
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he used the granddaddy of God,</v>

1350
01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:19.424
<v Speaker 3>of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1351
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 3>if you take me back to the Big Bang and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you show me that there was no god at</v>

1352
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:28.320
<v Speaker 3>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm willing to renounce my faith to</v>

1353
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.660
<v Speaker 3>which I answered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if I were able to do that,</v>

1354
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 3>you would still find a way to finagle</v>
<v Speaker 3>your way into justifying your belief.</v>

1355
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.770
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no amount of evidence that I</v>

1356
01:06:38.771 --> 01:06:41.950
<v Speaker 3>could ever provide you that would shake</v>
<v Speaker 3>your foundation.</v>

1357
01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:44.440
<v Speaker 3>So we really got into some heavy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1358
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the differences between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in his case he's an extremist</v>

1359
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Jew in the sense that he is the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing of Jews.</v>

1360
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come we could have this very,</v>

1361
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:59.641
<v Speaker 3>very difficult conversation and leave at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end shaking hands both richer for it</v>

1362
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 3>and no one's heads come off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1363
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 3>you were also a Jew though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1364
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.541
<v Speaker 3>did it help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1365
01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 3>what if he had that conversation with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim?</v>

1366
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that maybe maybe there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more intention but nobody's head would</v>

1367
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 3>be at least the John United Airlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1368
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.910
<v Speaker 3>My point is that I think part of Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

1369
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:20.050
<v Speaker 3>even when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1370
01:07:20.051 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 3>go to the yeshiva to study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say mood,</v>

1371
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:26.860
<v Speaker 3>is that there is this mechanism of we</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly argue about everything.</v>

1372
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is settled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to debate over everything,</v>

1373
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.440
<v Speaker 3>so you have to have that openness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit to have your ideas question and I</v>

1374
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:38.810
<v Speaker 3>think that if already Islam we're open</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that a bit more than maybe it would</v>

1375
01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 3>be in a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard some of the most compelling</v>

1376
01:07:41.201 --> 01:07:44.720
<v Speaker 3>arguments against the big bang from</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious people and what?</v>

1377
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Give me some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument against it is you are not</v>

1378
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 3>willing to believe that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>creator,</v>

1379
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.770
<v Speaker 3>that there is some sort of a system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was put in place by a much higher power</v>

1380
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 3>beyond what we can describe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're willing to believe that</v>

1381
01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 3>everything came out of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1382
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Something smaller than the head of a pin</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some reason that no one's ever</v>

1383
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 3>figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only evidence that we have is</v>

1384
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>the radio wave echoes of this event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1385
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.320
<v Speaker 3>So this is A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1386
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I've heard similar arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Thomas is an acquaintance,</v>

1387
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 3>is the guy who always argued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the twelfth century,</v>

1388
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 3>but the first mover that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>always go back and say at time zero.</v>

1389
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 3>What started that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What started the,</v>

1390
01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could ever really a</v>

1391
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>ultimately shake somebody foundations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1392
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:34.040
<v Speaker 3>There's no amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about the idea of shaking</v>

1393
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 3>someone's belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is odd that we're all willing to</v>

1394
01:08:38.871 --> 01:08:43.871
<v Speaker 3>believe the most insane version of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>creation of the universe ever without a</v>

1395
01:08:45.081 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 3>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every person of science,</v>

1396
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 3>people that believe in genes and atoms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and subatomic particles and corks and</v>

1397
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:55.430
<v Speaker 3>glue ons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they believe that at one point in</v>

1398
01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 3>time there was something that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller than the head of a pin that</v>

1399
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:04.181
<v Speaker 3>became the infinite space that we see in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of us that's constantly expanding</v>

1400
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 3>and so infant that.</v>

1401
01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that Lawrence Krauss</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1402
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 3>really fucked my mind up when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1403
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 3>He was explaining to me that when we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the universe and we're talking</v>

1404
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 3>about 13 point 7 billion years or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is you're seeing as it was.</v>

1405
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1406
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.240
<v Speaker 3>not just seeing it as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said you're only seeing the</v>

1407
01:09:23.241 --> 01:09:28.241
<v Speaker 3>observable universe because the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself is moving faster than the light</v>

1408
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.280
<v Speaker 3>that you see from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's entirely possible that it goes</v>

1409
01:09:34.281 --> 01:09:37.580
<v Speaker 3>back far further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't see it.</v>

1410
01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll listen to Richard Dawkins,</v>

1411
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:45.890
<v Speaker 3>the guy that we talked about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>about selfish gene has a wonderful</v>

1412
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 3>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called middle world.</v>

1413
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard this before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1414
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 3>but I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or jrr Tolkien's middle earth.</v>

1415
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.291
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1416
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 3>that's a load of ranks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1417
01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not too familiar with that stuff,</v>

1418
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.820
<v Speaker 3>but he talks about middle world.</v>

1419
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Speaker 3>The idea being that our brains evolved</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand phenomena at a level that</v>

1420
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 3>our brain interacts with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1421
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 3>He caused that middle world so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the cosmological level</v>

1422
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:17.960
<v Speaker 3>right at the Lawrence Krauss level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmology or at the national level,</v>

1423
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:20.390
<v Speaker 3>quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quantum physics.</v>

1424
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:25.690
<v Speaker 3>It's so esoteric that our brains haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved to understand phenomena at that</v>

1425
01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1426
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's counter intuitive for us to even do</v>

1427
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1428
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 3>think about it when you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually most physicists when they study</v>

1429
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:39.740
<v Speaker 3>things at those levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you that this stuff is so</v>

1430
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:40.490
<v Speaker 3>esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1431
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Richard Fineman the very famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>physicist,</v>

1432
01:10:42.301 --> 01:10:43.190
<v Speaker 3>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1433
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:44.050
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1434
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 3>if you think you understand quantum</v>
<v Speaker 3>physics,</v>

1435
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand quantum physics or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to that effect,</v>

1436
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:53.780
<v Speaker 3>that it is so esoteric and difficult for</v>
<v Speaker 3>human brains to understand things at</v>

1437
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:57.080
<v Speaker 3>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small or very big so,</v>

1438
01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:00.950
<v Speaker 3>but that not withstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that scientists</v>

1439
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:06.230
<v Speaker 3>succumb to belief just like religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do because scientists have</v>

1440
01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:10.910
<v Speaker 3>epistemic humility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means what I'm always</v>

1441
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 3>willing to see data if Rogan tomorrow</v>

1442
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>she comes to me with data showing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mechanisms of evolution as an</v>

1443
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:24.030
<v Speaker 2>unstated starting with Darwin are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would be a dishonest scientist to</v>

1444
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>not revise my beliefs in light of Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan's evidence.</v>

1445
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists are always open.</v>

1446
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>It's always provisional knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1447
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 2>it's only the best that we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in religion it's revealed truth.</v>

1448
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It is true because it is true because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in my book because it's true.</v>

1449
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious people are epistemologically</v>

1450
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 2>hottie they're arrogant because nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>could change their opinions.</v>

1451
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Whereas science has changed your</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions every day.</v>

1452
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're both succumbing to</v>

1453
01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:57.500
<v Speaker 2>belief systems now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily saying that I'm not,</v>

1454
01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not equating them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they're equal,</v>

1455
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:04.050
<v Speaker 2>but it is an odd belief and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily even belief,</v>

1456
01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:06.200
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an odd,</v>

1457
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an odd concept that because we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this exists and because we have</v>

1458
01:12:12.301 --> 01:12:17.301
<v Speaker 2>some sort of residual trace of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion a long time ago,</v>

1459
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 2>you can try and it's mind blowing.</v>

1460
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1461
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I probably just as a layperson in</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

1462
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:28.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one percent of what I see in a</v>

1463
01:12:28.121 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 2>national geographic on physics I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>even remotely understand,</v>

1464
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:33.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it just seems so.</v>

1465
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's not as though I'm not capable</v>
<v Speaker 2>of complex thought,</v>

1466
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's just so difficult for human</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

1467
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

1468
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 2>16 dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion light years away,</v>

1469
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1470
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.990
<v Speaker 2>for the light to travel for $16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion light years,</v>

1471
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1472
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 2>how do you understand these kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too big.</v>

1473
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the concept of life and death</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also luck.</v>

1474
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Our physical limitations because we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we live and die and we know that</v>

1475
01:12:57.571 --> 01:13:01.740
<v Speaker 2>the sun is going to burn out and we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that life on earth lives and dies and</v>

1476
01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:02.381
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1477
01:13:02.381 --> 01:13:07.381
<v Speaker 2>we impose these physical restrictions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very universe itself when in fact it</v>

1478
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:12.591
<v Speaker 2>might be some constant process of</v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding and contracting.</v>

1479
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.220
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the most disturbing ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the universe is gonna expand</v>

1480
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 2>infinitely and then contract infinitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then do it all over again.</v>

1481
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1482
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is even a correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

1483
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if maybe it's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>disputed,</v>

1484
01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but I had read once that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that the universe contracts to</v>

1485
01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:35.451
<v Speaker 2>some insanely infinite position and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>retracts down to the head of a pin</v>

1486
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:36.294
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1487
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole big bang is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual process that might take,</v>

1488
01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred trillion years or something</v>

1489
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1490
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you understand one</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1491
01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I understand zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1492
01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 2>zero point one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had this physicist on my</v>

1493
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.780
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be a fun guy to have on your</v>

1494
01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:55.770
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1495
01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.340
<v Speaker 2>his name is Lee Smolin a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who produced.</v>

1496
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.720
<v Speaker 2>The way that I discovered his work is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was looking for every possible</v>

1497
01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:10.890
<v Speaker 2>field that I could think of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory has been infused</v>

1498
01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>into field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1499
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my case,</v>

1500
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 5>I apply evolutionary psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>consumer behavior.</v>

1501
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.330
<v Speaker 5>You could study criminal criminality</v>
<v Speaker 5>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

1502
01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 5>You can study medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I was trying to come up with a</v>

1503
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 5>table that listed all of the various</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific disciplines where</v>

1504
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary principles have made</v>
<v Speaker 5>headway and the field at the highest</v>

1505
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember we were talking about middle</v>

1506
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:37.741
<v Speaker 5>world and the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He argued that the process of natural</v>

1507
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:43.321
<v Speaker 5>selection operates at the cosmological</v>
<v Speaker 5>level where this grand set of universes</v>

1508
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 5>are being selected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1509
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 5>in the same way that we select genes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1510
01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Some jeans get selected and others die</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1511
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 5>That that mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of a cosmological natural selection</v>

1512
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.960
<v Speaker 5>at the cosmological level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's how I first this.</v>

1513
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 5>It is so mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is so esoteric.</v>

1514
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:07.650
<v Speaker 5>It's so difficult to so nonpalpable that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1515
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it borders on taking mushrooms or</v>

1516
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.340
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics that that's how mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>blowing.</v>

1517
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.860
<v Speaker 5>So you should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you should check out our chat on</v>

1518
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:17.080
<v Speaker 5>my show is really cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might enjoy them.</v>

1519
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is fascinating.</v>

1520
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 5>We think of how much the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many possibilities exist in the</v>

1521
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:24.830
<v Speaker 5>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1522
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean how many different source</v>
<v Speaker 5>systems?</v>

1523
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Just hundreds of billions just in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>galaxy.</v>

1524
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:34.420
<v Speaker 5>One of hundreds of billions of gallons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like for our little tiny</v>

1525
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when we try to look at it in terms of</v>

1526
01:15:37.091 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 5>the big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not capable.</v>

1527
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 5>We don't have enough processing power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have enough hard drive space.</v>

1528
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:49.140
<v Speaker 5>We can't take all of these points of</v>
<v Speaker 5>data and bring them into our head and</v>

1529
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 5>consider them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's entirely possible that</v>

1530
01:15:52.301 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 5>everything you see in the world in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>of competition,</v>

1531
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 5>everything you see in the human world in</v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of competition,</v>

1532
01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 5>natural selection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the constant and never ending desire</v>

1533
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:05.950
<v Speaker 5>for innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for novelty,</v>

1534
01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 5>for new things.</v>

1535
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.960
<v Speaker 5>We have this constant desire to improve</v>
<v Speaker 5>upon every single thing that we've ever</v>

1536
01:16:10.961 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one ever looks at like a car,</v>

1537
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and says this is the best car ever,</v>

1538
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.400
<v Speaker 5>will not be improved upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're done.</v>

1539
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:20.120
<v Speaker 5>We don't need to make cars anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1540
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 5>They always want to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that has better airbags,</v>

1541
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:24.430
<v Speaker 5>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero to 60,</v>

1542
01:16:24.431 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 5>more protection for the passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>automated controls,</v>

1543
01:16:28.091 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 5>you know you can sit back and sleep</v>
<v Speaker 5>while your car drives you to work.</v>

1544
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.180
<v Speaker 5>There's all these things that we just</v>
<v Speaker 5>take for granted,</v>

1545
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 5>but they're always moving in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>direction of improvement and you could</v>

1546
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.310
<v Speaker 5>do that with life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go back to single celled organisms</v>

1547
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 5>which become multi celled organisms and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we always look at it like,</v>

1548
01:16:45.821 --> 01:16:47.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just a coincidence and it's</v>

1549
01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:50.200
<v Speaker 5>dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it becomes mammos and then it</v>

1550
01:16:50.201 --> 01:16:54.220
<v Speaker 5>becomes humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it becomes air plane riding,</v>

1551
01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 5>cell phone using video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having.</v>

1552
01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:00.550
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just gets more and more complex,</v>

1553
01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:01.271
<v Speaker 5>but we just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1554
01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 5>that's just coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

1555
01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Or is it moving in this constant state</v>
<v Speaker 5>of improvement until we create an</v>

1556
01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 5>artificial</v>

1557
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.520
<v Speaker 4>being that can accelerate things far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far faster than our biological</v>

1558
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.120
<v Speaker 4>limitations are capable of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not sure if this is where you</v>

1559
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:21.350
<v Speaker 4>want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as you,</v>

1560
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 4>as you were describing this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>quest for improvement,</v>

1561
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.980
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1562
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:31.150
<v Speaker 4>one of the threats of that reflects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or one of the dangers of that reflex is</v>

1563
01:17:31.551 --> 01:17:36.551
<v Speaker 4>precisely how totalitarian ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 4>develop where they argued that our</v>

1564
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.920
<v Speaker 4>current state of the world is faulty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if only you implement our ideology,</v>

1565
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:45.590
<v Speaker 4>the shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be communism.</v>

1566
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be perfect.</v>

1567
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.450
<v Speaker 4>Then it could be perfect socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1568
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there is a way by which we could</v>

1569
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:57.650
<v Speaker 4>reach that utopia if only you adhere to</v>
<v Speaker 4>our ideology.</v>

1570
01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 4>So there's a real danger in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>succumbing to that.</v>

1571
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:01.900
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the.</v>

1572
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a book by William Gardner who might come</v>

1573
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 4>on my show.</v>

1574
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a political scientist.</v>

1575
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 4>His book is called the great divide</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he actually lays out some of the</v>

1576
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 4>sort of fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 4>foundational differences between</v>

1577
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Liberals and conservatives in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their world views and how because of the</v>

1578
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 4>starting positions being sold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

1579
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 4>having no overlap between them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the venn diagrams don't overlap.</v>

1580
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.450
<v Speaker 4>That's why you ended up speaking over</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other without being able to find</v>

1581
01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 4>common grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of these differences is that an</v>

1582
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:35.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I described something similar using</v>

1583
01:18:35.061 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 4>different terms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the quote,</v>

1584
01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:42.101
<v Speaker 4>liberals and progressives view our brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>as being blank slates,</v>

1585
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's infinitely malleable and so if you</v>

1586
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 4>see differences between people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can't be because there was a starting</v>

1587
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:56.321
<v Speaker 4>point difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jordan was not innately likely</v>

1588
01:18:56.601 --> 01:19:00.650
<v Speaker 4>to be better than you in basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were some environmental conditions</v>

1589
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 4>that lead Michael Jordan to become who</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is and not get sad to be the best nba</v>

1590
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:06.134
<v Speaker 4>player ever.</v>

1591
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 4>And if only we can find the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 4>social intervention strategies,</v>

1592
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 4>then we could all have equality of</v>
<v Speaker 4>outcomes.</v>

1593
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.170
<v Speaker 4>And so that is a faulty understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 4>human nature because human nature,</v>

1594
01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:19.370
<v Speaker 4>as you of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1595
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:23.750
<v Speaker 4>it's really an interaction of our</v>
<v Speaker 4>biology and our environment.</v>

1596
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 4>But so much of the welfare state is</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on this idea that no,</v>

1597
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 4>we need more of your tax money so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could implement a social engineering</v>

1598
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:38.141
<v Speaker 4>program so that we could reach that</v>
<v Speaker 4>utopia where we're all equal outcome.</v>

1599
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 4>And frankly I think that that's complete</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>

1600
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:45.680
<v Speaker 4>It is fascinating that people seek</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort in communism and socialism for</v>

1601
01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 4>that very reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they almost are trying to slow down</v>

1602
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:50.810
<v Speaker 4>the competition that they can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1603
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1604
01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 4>I see it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by my university.</v>

1605
01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 4>So in Canada there's a very sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>social welfare states and Quebec,</v>

1606
01:19:58.130 --> 01:20:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the province where I live is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>socialist on welfare,</v>

1607
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 4>on steroids.</v>

1608
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.930
<v Speaker 4>And so in the context of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>university's,</v>

1609
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the metrics of reward are removed</v>

1610
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 4>so that we can have equality of</v>
<v Speaker 4>outcomes.</v>

1611
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 4>And the way that you instantiate that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

1612
01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unions,</v>

1613
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a very powerful union that</v>

1614
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 4>ensures that all professors are roughly</v>
<v Speaker 4>treated equally because we're all social</v>

1615
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 4>ads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a queen bee and then the rest of</v>

1616
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:28.440
<v Speaker 4>us are all equal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course humans are not equal.</v>

1617
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Some are smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some work harder,</v>

1618
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.270
<v Speaker 4>some are more apathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some are honest,</v>

1619
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 4>some are cheaters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this idea of constantly having to</v>

1620
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:41.031
<v Speaker 4>have some external agent managed the</v>
<v Speaker 4>process so that we could all be equal to</v>

1621
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:44.220
<v Speaker 4>me is grotesque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it goes back to I think probably our</v>

1622
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:46.470
<v Speaker 4>first conversation you and I had when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was saying that,</v>

1623
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to eventually come through</v>

1624
01:20:48.331 --> 01:20:51.690
<v Speaker 4>southern California because at least in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

1625
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 4>the society has been less progressive</v>
<v Speaker 4>dies by the social welfare idea.</v>

1626
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 4>Of course the Democrats are more so than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Republicans.</v>

1627
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:04.970
<v Speaker 4>But as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada is basically pure social welfare.</v>

1628
01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 4>We're all equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course Justin Trudeau is</v>

1629
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:10.320
<v Speaker 4>certainly trying to push that idea even</v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

1630
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 4>He's too handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that guy's problem he's trying to</v>

1631
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:15.960
<v Speaker 4>make up for the fact that it's beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's trying to be super sweet to</v>

1632
01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:17.460
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on up there.</v>

1633
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just put up a clip a few days ago</v>

1634
01:21:20.611 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 4>about the Ahmad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How their case do you know that is.</v>

1635
01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:26.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a few people tweeted,</v>

1636
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please talk to Joe Rogan about this.</v>

1637
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all my,</v>

1638
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:30.830
<v Speaker 4>how that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1639
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Muslim guy whose family had become</v>

1640
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 4>Canadian citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the father had taken them away.</v>

1641
01:21:39.421 --> 01:21:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I think the Pakistan at one point until</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan in another.</v>

1642
01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at one point they were living in</v>

1643
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Bali bomb territory.</v>

1644
01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:51.020
<v Speaker 4>This is 2002 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the US military had engaged in some</v>

1645
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:53.270
<v Speaker 4>firefight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1646
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 4>at one point they even lived in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>compound of bin Ladin.</v>

1647
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 4>So these were really real apple Pie</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian folks.</v>

1648
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:04.730
<v Speaker 4>And all my father who was 15 years old</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently threw a grenade engaged in a</v>

1649
01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:08.130
<v Speaker 4>firefight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed one a US soldier,</v>

1650
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 4>and I think blind that his second one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was taken to Guantanamo Bay as a 15</v>

1651
01:22:13.051 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 4>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spent many years there.</v>

1652
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.360
<v Speaker 4>He was a military tribunal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>US Guantanamo tribunals gave him a</v>

1653
01:22:21.631 --> 01:22:25.680
<v Speaker 4>symbolic sentence of 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was symbolic in that I think it</v>

1654
01:22:25.681 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 4>was only going to be a h here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They agreed on a plea deal of eight</v>

1655
01:22:29.191 --> 01:22:30.024
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1656
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Then he was extradited to Canada very</v>
<v Speaker 4>quickly after that he was released</v>

1657
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:39.330
<v Speaker 4>because you already served quite a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>years in Guantanamo and then he filed a</v>

1658
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.080
<v Speaker 4>lawsuit against the Canadian government</v>
<v Speaker 4>for not having protected his Canadian</v>

1659
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.860
<v Speaker 4>charter rights because he was a child</v>
<v Speaker 4>soldier and so on.</v>

1660
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:55.190
<v Speaker 4>And he just settled on a 10 point</v>
<v Speaker 4>$5,000,000 settlement and an official</v>

1661
01:22:57.090 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 4>apology by the Canadian government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1662
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 4>and then some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people were outraged.</v>

1663
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Most Canadians are outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you should see the comments and</v>

1664
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:08.260
<v Speaker 4>some of my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my youtube channel,</v>

1665
01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of pig are you talking to me</v>

1666
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 4>that I would not understand that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>was an innocent child soldier who.</v>

1667
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:17.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because most of us are usually hanging</v>

1668
01:23:17.411 --> 01:23:20.630
<v Speaker 4>around when we were 15 and the compound</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the law than,</v>

1669
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 4>and lobbing bombs at incoming marines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1670
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.750
<v Speaker 4>it's a very Canadian apple pie thing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1671
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reflex is not to be outraged at my</v>

1672
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 4>taxpayers are funding this guy now in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 point $5,000,000 settlement.</v>

1673
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a racist pig for not understanding</v>

1674
01:23:37.341 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 4>that this was just an innocent child</v>
<v Speaker 4>soldier at the wrong place at the wrong</v>

1675
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:41.464
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1676
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:43.840
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's look at two different things.</v>

1677
01:23:43.841 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of money they gave him.</v>

1678
01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of crazy that your tax dollars</v>

1679
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 5>go to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's look at the 15 year old kid,</v>

1680
01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you expect and what could</v>

1681
01:23:54.401 --> 01:23:59.400
<v Speaker 5>possibly be done to dissuade him from</v>
<v Speaker 5>following this path?</v>

1682
01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.530
<v Speaker 5>He's living in bin Laden's compound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about someone who's</v>

1683
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable to ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty year old men are vulnerable to</v>

1684
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:09.160
<v Speaker 5>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about a 15 year old child?</v>

1685
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:14.560
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know how much blame you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>put on a kid now when it comes to</v>

1686
01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:19.180
<v Speaker 5>throwing a bomb at someone and taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>the life of another human being.</v>

1687
01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be a lot of circumstances</v>

1688
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 5>involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to know what they are</v>

1689
01:24:24.281 --> 01:24:27.850
<v Speaker 5>before I think about any judgment</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever because I don't know.</v>

1690
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Were they shooting at him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were they shooting at someone he knew</v>

1691
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 5>someone who knew getting murdered by a</v>
<v Speaker 5>US soldier.</v>

1692
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Was he actively engaged in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>military training and considering</v>

1693
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 5>becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming a militant?</v>

1694
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:43.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 is a baby.</v>

1695
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:45.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1696
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can drive a car at 16 and Quebec.</v>

1697
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.710
<v Speaker 4>You can start driving drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1698
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.920
<v Speaker 4>At 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what is my team?</v>

1699
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1700
01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.260
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mother and father,</v>

1701
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.210
<v Speaker 4>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my father was 19.</v>

1702
01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:01.220
<v Speaker 4>My mother was almost 16 when they got</v>
<v Speaker 4>married.</v>

1703
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:05.660
<v Speaker 4>So you can procreate and have a child</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't understand the.</v>

1704
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's be real about physiologically</v>

1705
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:11.770
<v Speaker 5>your frontal cortex isn't even formed</v>
<v Speaker 5>until you're 25.</v>

1706
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 5>When you're 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not capable of making like</v>

1707
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.750
<v Speaker 5>especially living in a war zone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not capable of making moral and</v>

1708
01:25:19.751 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 5>ethical judgements above and beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology that you're being raised.</v>

1709
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1710
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:25.121
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1711
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:29.440
<v Speaker 4>I agree that most of us in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation may not have been able to</v>

1712
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 4>extricate ourselves from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what I'm going to say next doesn't</v>

1713
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 4>necessarily support the outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it gives it greater context.</v>

1714
01:25:37.331 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 4>He does come from a family if you later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you check when we get off the air,</v>

1715
01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.690
<v Speaker 4>the sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cues of this family,</v>

1716
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:51.930
<v Speaker 4>they don't seem as though they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>assimilating very nicely within Canadian</v>

1717
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>value system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

1718
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:59.250
<v Speaker 4>for most Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reflex of taking this guy who seems</v>

1719
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 4>to be quite resistant to liberty and</v>
<v Speaker 4>modernity freedoms</v>

1720
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.830
<v Speaker 3>and rewarding him with 10 point</v>
<v Speaker 3>$5,000,000,</v>

1721
01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this 10 point five Canadian.</v>

1722
01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:11.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's probably $30 American at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1723
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.900
<v Speaker 3>The doctor thought we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys were real similar.</v>

1724
01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 3>We were a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at par and I think now we're at</v>

1725
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.350
<v Speaker 3>one point three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're about 20,</v>

1726
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.760
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 percent less than you.</v>

1727
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>So that's how it was when I was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first used to go up to Montreal,</v>

1728
01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 3>like in the nineties at the par or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or different.</v>

1729
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Different the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying now the American dollar</v>

1730
01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 3>went far longer up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>

1731
01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:36.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1732
01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>it's heading back towards that now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at,</v>

1733
01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 3>not not to the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst I've ever seen.</v>

1734
01:26:42.201 --> 01:26:46.070
<v Speaker 3>It was when we lived in California in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2001 to 2003.</v>

1735
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:51.340
<v Speaker 3>At one point it was points 64 or 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's at about point 75,</v>

1736
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 3>so it's not the worst that it's ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

1737
01:26:53.631 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 3>but we're heading in that direction.</v>

1738
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:56.870
<v Speaker 3>But since we're talking about kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1739
01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.560
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'd like to talk about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that you've had Jordan</v>

1740
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Peterson on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you follow both of our respective,</v>

1741
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1742
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:09.920
<v Speaker 3>testimonies in front of the Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Senate regarding Bill 16 and you know,</v>

1743
01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I've read a lot of Jordan stuff on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him speak a lot and I've seen,</v>

1744
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I saw that one conversation that he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>on television in Canada with some person</v>

1745
01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:23.630
<v Speaker 3>who is a professor in gender studies who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is ambiguously sexual.</v>

1746
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a guy or a girl or a</v>

1747
01:27:26.961 --> 01:27:29.600
<v Speaker 3>transgender woman to man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what it seemed to be,</v>

1748
01:27:29.601 --> 01:27:30.434
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1749
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 3>And the one who was saying that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no that gender,</v>

1750
01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 3>there was no biological difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and women.</v>

1751
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is just fucking horseshit.</v>

1752
01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is just like one plus one is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too.</v>

1753
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:47.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously a broad spectrum of</v>

1754
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.960
<v Speaker 3>variation and both sexes and they kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of coalesce in the middle somewhere with</v>

1755
01:27:53.481 --> 01:27:54.111
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1756
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:57.710
<v Speaker 3>what's amazing is that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting this battle and academia</v>

1757
01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 3>precisely because of what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is introduce evolutionary</v>

1758
01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 3>psychology and the social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these types of conversations,</v>

1759
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 3>these ludicrous conversations I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing them for for much of my</v>

1760
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.490
<v Speaker 3>scientific career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's extraordinary at this point is</v>

1761
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:17.520
<v Speaker 3>that some of this nonsense is now</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming law in Canada.</v>

1762
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 3>So to kind of give you the background to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>

1763
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.940
<v Speaker 3>So I was invited both speaking by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian Senate,</v>

1764
01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:26.810
<v Speaker 3>then also to give a talk in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>parliament on Parliament Hill,</v>

1765
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.250
<v Speaker 3>but the Canadian Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the part was built [inaudible],</v>

1766
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 3>which is a bill that seeks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporate gender identity and gender</v>

1767
01:28:35.781 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 3>expression under the rubric of hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes.</v>

1768
01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way that I can</v>

1769
01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:43.460
<v Speaker 3>discriminate against you for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion or your race or your ethnicity,</v>

1770
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't discriminate against you because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your gender identity or gender</v>

1771
01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:49.970
<v Speaker 3>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then that would be a hate crime.</v>

1772
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And so I appeared in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian Senate to simply say that while</v>

1773
01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:58.220
<v Speaker 3>of course everybody's person who should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be respected and we're all equal under</v>

1774
01:28:58.221 --> 01:29:01.430
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the manner by which the bill was a</v>

1775
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 3>table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

1776
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.040
<v Speaker 4>way it was written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so vague as as it for it to be</v>

1777
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I gave examples.</v>

1778
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.180
<v Speaker 4>So let me just mentioned a few here for</v>
<v Speaker 4>your viewers.</v>

1779
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.373
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1780
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Harvard University,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their lgbtq office,</v>

1781
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 4>came out with a pamphlet that said that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of promulgating,</v>

1782
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to quote fixed binaries</v>
<v Speaker 4>and biological essentialism,</v>

1783
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 4>close quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixed binaries,</v>

1784
01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 4>means male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>

1785
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:32.900
<v Speaker 4>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentialism,</v>

1786
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.140
<v Speaker 4>is to argue that anything is biological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea of a gay thing,</v>

1787
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:41.730
<v Speaker 4>fixed binaries and biological</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentialism is a form of transphobic,</v>

1788
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 4>systemic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not violence.</v>

1789
01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Violence is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not metaphorical.</v>

1790
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:47.930
<v Speaker 4>It's not allegorical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad.</v>

1791
01:29:47.931 --> 01:29:52.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean violence in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a form of Transphobia,</v>

1792
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:55.550
<v Speaker 4>but specifically systemic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobia know,</v>

1793
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.430
<v Speaker 4>how do they define violence because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a very specific definition of</v>

1794
01:29:59.431 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I don't know how they defined it</v>

1795
01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.230
<v Speaker 4>in the general sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the desire to come up with</v>

1796
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.150
<v Speaker 4>ever broadening definitions of violence</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that any,</v>

1797
01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:13.120
<v Speaker 4>any trans question that you commit could</v>
<v Speaker 4>fit under that rubric.</v>

1798
01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Even microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>microaggression is a form of violence,</v>

1799
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1800
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 4>so then I went in front of the Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 4>Senate.</v>

1801
01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not you,</v>

1802
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.030
<v Speaker 4>you could watch this later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1803
01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:22.950
<v Speaker 4>it's on my channel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1804
01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:26.940
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single thing that I teach in my</v>

1805
01:30:26.941 --> 01:30:31.941
<v Speaker 4>courses would constitute transphobic</v>
<v Speaker 4>systemic violence based on that sort of</v>

1806
01:30:32.431 --> 01:30:33.264
<v Speaker 4>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1807
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 4>It sound scientific data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1808
01:30:35.191 --> 01:30:38.820
<v Speaker 4>So if I get up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here is how sexual selection works,</v>

1809
01:30:38.821 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sexual selection is the mechanism that</v>

1810
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.860
<v Speaker 4>explains how sex specific traits evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1811
01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:48.240
<v Speaker 4>sex specific traits evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You recognize that there is male and</v>

1812
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:50.130
<v Speaker 4>there's female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's why.</v>

1813
01:30:50.131 --> 01:30:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Human males are likely to have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually selected to be more risk</v>

1814
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.010
<v Speaker 4>takers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1815
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by engaging in that conversation,</v>

1816
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:04.220
<v Speaker 4>I would be promulgating fixed binaries</v>
<v Speaker 4>and biological essentialism,</v>

1817
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:08.040
<v Speaker 4>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transphobic violence because a</v>

1818
01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.230
<v Speaker 4>transgendered student can come up to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

1819
01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.220
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor,</v>

1820
01:31:11.221 --> 01:31:14.220
<v Speaker 4>you've thought your core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've listened to your course 13 weeks.</v>

1821
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 4>You talked about evolve mating</v>
<v Speaker 4>preferences on.</v>

1822
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Not once did you talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>non-gender,</v>

1823
01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 4>the non binary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gender fluid,</v>

1824
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.430
<v Speaker 4>the other kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

1825
01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's marginalized me.</v>

1826
01:31:25.441 --> 01:31:26.950
<v Speaker 4>That's excluded me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1827
01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.010
<v Speaker 4>you're being biased,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're being prejudicial.</v>

1828
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:34.370
<v Speaker 4>So I tried to argue that most of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal senators either laughed and</v>

1829
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:38.670
<v Speaker 4>scoffed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them accused me of being pro</v>

1830
01:31:38.671 --> 01:31:41.160
<v Speaker 4>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is on record and the Canadian</v>

1831
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a scientist.</v>

1832
01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:45.120
<v Speaker 4>What's this person's name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Senator Joel,</v>

1833
01:31:45.121 --> 01:31:47.690
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started pushing the which has now</v>

1834
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.230
<v Speaker 4>become maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an internet.</v>

1835
01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.170
<v Speaker 4>You have a conversation with them and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it in there.</v>

1836
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.540
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conversation we had was promoting</v>

1837
01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:55.610
<v Speaker 4>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said,</v>

1838
01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you respond to that when someone</v>

1839
01:31:57.241 --> 01:31:58.620
<v Speaker 4>says that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that my response,</v>

1840
01:31:58.621 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 4>which you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

1841
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.031
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1842
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:06.031
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that given the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>escape execution in Lebanon because of</v>

1843
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 4>my Jewish heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I need to be lectured about a</v>

1844
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 4>genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that sort of took them back.</v>

1845
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Now apparently later and I didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 4>this apparently later,</v>

1846
01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:18.460
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to retract some of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>comments and apologize for them.</v>

1847
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you are not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did they justify genocide?</v>

1848
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when you have your</v>

1849
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:25.570
<v Speaker 4>brain parenthesized by ostrich parasitic</v>
<v Speaker 4>syndrome.</v>

1850
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:29.080
<v Speaker 4>How does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it okay to study all of these</v>

1851
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:33.070
<v Speaker 4>behavior patterns in aunts and monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dogs and what have you,</v>

1852
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 4>but you can't with human beings because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do with human being somehow or</v>

1853
01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that you find about generalized</v>

1854
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:46.920
<v Speaker 4>behavior patterns or specific sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>preferences that somehow or another</v>

1855
01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:53.460
<v Speaker 4>marginalizes or in some way diminishes</v>
<v Speaker 4>how another person is living their life</v>

1856
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 4>to the point where it becomes violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's actually a term for what you</v>

1857
01:32:57.431 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 4>just asked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the human reticence effect</v>

1858
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:04.750
<v Speaker 4>and simply put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people are perfectly happy to</v>

1859
01:33:04.751 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 4>use evolutionary arguments to explain</v>
<v Speaker 4>the behavior of the salamander,</v>

1860
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 4>the Hyena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mosquito,</v>

1861
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:14.560
<v Speaker 4>the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you use the exact same</v>

1862
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary principle to explain human</v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomena,</v>

1863
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly it's no go.</v>

1864
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think?</v>

1865
01:33:21.431 --> 01:33:23.350
<v Speaker 4>It's because we're aspiring to something</v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1866
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because people succumb to</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrongly,</v>

1867
01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.960
<v Speaker 4>so to the idea of biological</v>
<v Speaker 4>determinism,</v>

1868
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:33.400
<v Speaker 4>they think that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you call up and explaining a</v>

1869
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a biological principle,</v>

1870
01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Speaker 4>that means you are doing to your</v>
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>

1871
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:41.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a fatalistic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of course is nonsense because</v>

1872
01:33:41.201 --> 01:33:44.380
<v Speaker 4>there's no such thing as biological</v>
<v Speaker 4>determinism because most of the things</v>

1873
01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.790
<v Speaker 4>that are triggered by our biology have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be triggered by interacting with the</v>

1874
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:49.624
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1875
01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Genes are turned on or off as a function</v>
<v Speaker 4>of environmental inputs and outputs,</v>

1876
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:59.590
<v Speaker 4>so the idea of biological determinism is</v>
<v Speaker 4>false worry.</v>

1877
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Much of what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the interaction as</v>

1878
01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Much of who we are as an interaction of</v>

1879
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:10.381
<v Speaker 4>our genes and our environments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for most people there is something</v>

1880
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:15.810
<v Speaker 4>vulgar about reducing the richness of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human condition to our biology.</v>

1881
01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:21.010
<v Speaker 4>It just feels wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This explains the behavior of the Hyena,</v>

1882
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 4>but we are above that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are cultural animals.</v>

1883
01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 4>We are prone to conditioning and</v>
<v Speaker 4>socialization and higher order</v>

1884
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:30.700
<v Speaker 4>cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could even take evolutionary</v>

1885
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:33.760
<v Speaker 4>biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these are people who are trained in</v>

1886
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:37.150
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will commit this error.</v>

1887
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's breathtaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1888
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.490
<v Speaker 4>So the classic example is a guy who is</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise an utter buffoon.</v>

1889
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:46.660
<v Speaker 4>His name is Ed Meyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fifth through eighth academic.</v>

1890
01:34:46.661 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 4>And I say this because not to denigrate</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

1891
01:34:49.061 --> 01:34:51.780
<v Speaker 4>but by zed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the letter z</v>

1892
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 4>Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So pz Myers in his claim to fame is he's</v>

1893
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:59.150
<v Speaker 4>got a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hats off to him.</v>

1894
01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 4>He's got an incredibly popular</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific,</v>

1895
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.370
<v Speaker 4>a blog called fire wrangler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

1896
01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 4>gets $100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million views or something.</v>

1897
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.190
<v Speaker 4>So he's done very well for himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's the guy who is perfectly happy</v>

1898
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 4>to use evolutionary principles to</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain the behavior of the mating</v>

1899
01:35:18.321 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1900
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Of the salamander,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I come along as an evolutionary</v>

1901
01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 4>psychologist and use the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1902
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:28.100
<v Speaker 4>the exact same logical structure to</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain human behavior,</v>

1903
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's this guy doing with this bullshit</v>

1904
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:33.530
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology stuff that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>set that pseudo science right,</v>

1905
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 4>and the the reflex he has that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because to somehow explain it for the</v>

1906
01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 4>salamander,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sense?</v>

1907
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 4>It's national geographic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but humans,</v>

1908
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not prone to biology and I'll</v>

1909
01:35:45.711 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 4>just give you two other examples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephen Jay Gould,</v>

1910
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Richard Lewington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who were very,</v>

1911
01:35:50.571 --> 01:35:54.970
<v Speaker 4>very famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harvard evolutionists also despised</v>

1912
01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:58.340
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for other reasons they were avowed</v>

1913
01:35:58.341 --> 01:36:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came sort of from the hippie</v>

1914
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 4>generation is of the market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're probably about 20 years older</v>

1915
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:03.831
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1916
01:36:03.831 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 4>one of the announced passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephen Jay Gould is that,</v>

1917
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.820
<v Speaker 4>but they were guys who thought that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology is right,</v>

1918
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 4>then they're Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit ideologies would be wrong.</v>

1919
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.900
<v Speaker 4>So they were strong anti evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology folks,</v>

1920
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.740
<v Speaker 4>even though all of their training</v>
<v Speaker 4>suggested that they should be for it.</v>

1921
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:23.480
<v Speaker 4>So they are the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1922
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:25.730
<v Speaker 4>who used to Eo Wilson I mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>

1923
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 4>So eo Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The social ads guy wrote a book called a</v>

1924
01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 4>sociobiology in 1975 where he explained</v>
<v Speaker 4>how evolutionary theory could explain</v>

1925
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:40.610
<v Speaker 4>behavior across all sorts of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was happy with the book and</v>

1926
01:36:40.611 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 4>one of the last chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he applies all these principles to the</v>

1927
01:36:44.421 --> 01:36:48.080
<v Speaker 4>human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He became persona non grata.</v>

1928
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:51.170
<v Speaker 4>He became a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't go anywhere to give a talk</v>

1929
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:54.520
<v Speaker 4>without being shouted down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not unlike how you're seeing Milo today</v>

1930
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:55.790
<v Speaker 4>being shouted down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1931
01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:00.740
<v Speaker 4>Eo Wilson went through those culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>wars 30 years ago because evolutionary</v>

1932
01:37:00.741 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 4>psychology was attacking the pet</v>
<v Speaker 4>political ideologies of his colleagues</v>

1933
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:06.070
<v Speaker 4>at Harvard.</v>

1934
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if Milo's a valid</v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison.</v>

1935
01:37:07.841 --> 01:37:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I think Jordan Peterson better</v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison.</v>

1936
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:12.280
<v Speaker 5>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because Milo is obviously a provocateur,</v>

1937
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.850
<v Speaker 5>1 trillion on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you put tea?</v>

1938
01:37:15.190 --> 01:37:17.200
<v Speaker 5>Instead of pointing the finger at</v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals?</v>

1939
01:37:17.201 --> 01:37:21.070
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't like to try to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously we're not going to,</v>

1940
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.600
<v Speaker 5>but let's discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1941
01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:25.120
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the motivation?</v>

1942
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Why do people resist these ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at the data of human interaction</v>

1943
01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:36.421
<v Speaker 5>and genetics and sexual preference?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do they resist examining these</v>

1944
01:37:37.781 --> 01:37:41.320
<v Speaker 5>factors?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it about and what is it</v>

1945
01:37:41.321 --> 01:37:44.830
<v Speaker 5>about people that like that guy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about that wants to point</v>

1946
01:37:44.831 --> 01:37:49.831
<v Speaker 5>at you for examining these factors and</v>
<v Speaker 5>call you horrific names and just for</v>

1947
01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:55.231
<v Speaker 5>looking at actual provable data data</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can mean you could show it,</v>

1948
01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.140
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

1949
01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 4>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's reviewed.</v>

1950
01:37:58.171 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 4>You can what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is?</v>

1951
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:03.120
<v Speaker 4>What's the motivation is it's ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 4>ego driven.</v>

1952
01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:08.150
<v Speaker 4>So in the case of those Harvard folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are committed Marxists,</v>

1953
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If evolutionary psychology is right,</v>

1954
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 4>therefore my pet political ideology is</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

1955
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 4>therefore I have to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one example.</v>

1956
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do a.</v>

1957
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.790
<v Speaker 4>suppose I am a overweight woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1958
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:25.660
<v Speaker 4>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get much action on the mating</v>

1959
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.870
<v Speaker 4>market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of two things can happen.</v>

1960
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.910
<v Speaker 4>I could either believe that there is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved preference that men have for</v>

1961
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:37.911
<v Speaker 4>certain universal standards of beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I could go for the much more a</v>

1962
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:44.460
<v Speaker 4>comforting message,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that these beauty standards are</v>

1963
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.590
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexist,</v>

1964
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal standards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if only men would stop being shallow</v>

1965
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 4>and buying into these Hollywood images</v>
<v Speaker 4>than myself,</v>

1966
01:38:55.650 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 4>this beautiful 800 pound woman would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting all the action in the world.</v>

1967
01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:04.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's nothing wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that there are outside forces that</v>

1968
01:39:04.711 --> 01:39:07.470
<v Speaker 4>are causing these arbitrary preferences</v>
<v Speaker 4>to arise.</v>

1969
01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Naomi Wolf wrote a book and the early</v>

1970
01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:12.960
<v Speaker 4>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1971
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:18.260
<v Speaker 4>the beauty myth that sold millions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>copies where she argued that there is no</v>

1972
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:20.400
<v Speaker 4>such thing as universal standards of</v>
<v Speaker 4>beauty.</v>

1973
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:23.400
<v Speaker 4>It's all a beauty myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the patriarchy that imposes these</v>

1974
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:26.520
<v Speaker 4>beauty myths on women to attack their</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of self.</v>

1975
01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a woman who doesn't score well,</v>

1976
01:39:29.370 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 4>even if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a man,</v>

1977
01:39:30.541 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know that women prefer men of</v>

1978
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:35.130
<v Speaker 4>high status,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1979
01:39:35.131 --> 01:39:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I could do one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could get out there and shake my butt</v>

1980
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:42.510
<v Speaker 4>and get the status right Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gave him all this stuff that you</v>

1981
01:39:42.511 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to work hard for all your</v>

1982
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:47.520
<v Speaker 4>success so that you could then hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 4>do well on the mating market,</v>

1983
01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I could say,</v>

1984
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:51.510
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are all arbitrary standards.</v>

1985
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:52.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and adjust world.</v>

1986
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:57.570
<v Speaker 4>My being a lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apathetic Beta male would just be as</v>

1987
01:39:57.571 --> 01:40:01.320
<v Speaker 4>worthy of love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think ultimately there is an</v>

1988
01:40:01.321 --> 01:40:06.321
<v Speaker 4>element to biological based explanations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's unhopeful to most people,</v>

1989
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:11.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that we could all be anything</v>

1990
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:15.420
<v Speaker 4>is a lot more hopeful and the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could all be anything unconstrained</v>

1991
01:40:15.421 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 4>by biology only exists in the recesses</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ideologues.</v>

1992
01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 4>The world is not made up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

1993
01:40:22.921 --> 01:40:25.020
<v Speaker 4>People are more symmetric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1994
01:40:25.021 --> 01:40:27.060
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>symmetric,</v>

1995
01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 4>you're doomed to a life of celibacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

1996
01:40:30.211 --> 01:40:35.160
<v Speaker 4>the fact that Brad Pitt Brad Pitt is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is considered handsome because he</v>

1997
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:39.450
<v Speaker 4>exhibits certain cues that women all</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the world agree are beautiful.</v>

1998
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:43.770
<v Speaker 4>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is something very non hopeful</v>

1999
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:48.030
<v Speaker 4>about buying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that we are biological beings.</v>

2000
01:40:48.031 --> 01:40:52.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more comforting to know we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are infinitely malleable and filthy</v>

2001
01:40:52.711 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 4>social bubble because</v>

2002
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 5>then any of us could be anything given</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right conditions.</v>

2003
01:40:57.430 --> 01:41:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I could be the next lionelle messy</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hopeful and therefore I'd like to</v>

2004
01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:05.420
<v Speaker 5>subscribe to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's absolutely something to</v>

2005
01:41:05.421 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's also this very</v>

2006
01:41:09.101 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 5>strange and vague possibility that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>are aspiring to a higher standard</v>

2007
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:18.190
<v Speaker 5>because we recognize that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>are evolving and that we're moving into</v>

2008
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:21.940
<v Speaker 5>some strange place where we're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're no longer just creatures of flesh</v>

2009
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:25.930
<v Speaker 5>and that this need to put people on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2010
01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Even playing field is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a part of this aspiration.</v>

2011
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.480
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think there's these</v>
<v Speaker 5>influences and I definitely think there</v>

2012
01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:38.620
<v Speaker 5>are these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that look at</v>

2013
01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:41.320
<v Speaker 5>beautiful people and they get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a.</v>

2014
01:41:41.321 --> 01:41:45.490
<v Speaker 5>there's a way that they do it where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel that they're justified in being</v>

2015
01:41:45.491 --> 01:41:48.790
<v Speaker 5>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they can see a guy like the rock</v>

2016
01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.100
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's as big,</v>

2017
01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 5>handsome man as big burly man and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that guy's a fucking idiot.</v>

2018
01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.730
<v Speaker 5>Immediately me and while that guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably reads a lot,</v>

2019
01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.080
<v Speaker 5>he's probably smart as hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2020
01:41:59.081 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 5>and he's obviously very ambitious so he</v>
<v Speaker 5>can control his mind.</v>

2021
01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's very disciplined.</v>

2022
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.840
<v Speaker 5>He controls his mind far better than a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of overweight people that would</v>

2023
01:42:07.841 --> 01:42:12.841
<v Speaker 5>criticize him and call him a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile they let their body rot to</v>

2024
01:42:13.181 --> 01:42:16.240
<v Speaker 5>the state of decay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is not an intellectual thing to do</v>

2025
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 5>if you're looking at your body and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a as a finite resource and how do you</v>

2026
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.170
<v Speaker 5>manage that resource?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2027
01:42:22.171 --> 01:42:23.950
<v Speaker 5>very poorly for eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ring dings,</v>

2028
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.220
<v Speaker 5>drinking fucking soda and smoking</v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes and then talking about the</v>

2029
01:42:27.221 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 5>rock being an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2030
01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are obviously strom and</v>

2031
01:42:30.641 --> 01:42:35.641
<v Speaker 5>exemptions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wonder if what we're doing with</v>

2032
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:41.130
<v Speaker 5>what's going on in Canada and this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this liberal social justice warrior</v>

2033
01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 5>approach to everybody being equal and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>

2034
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 5>let's try to make them equal and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's anybody that's superior to try</v>

2035
01:42:49.751 --> 01:42:54.250
<v Speaker 5>to push them down and bring the Brown</v>
<v Speaker 5>people up and I wonder if we're trying</v>

2036
01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 5>to achieve some sort of equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of balance,</v>

2037
01:42:58.001 --> 01:43:02.350
<v Speaker 5>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of state where we're no longer</v>

2038
01:43:02.351 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 5>just monkeys were no longer just</v>
<v Speaker 5>creatures of,</v>

2039
01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to fuck her because she's got big</v>

2040
01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 5>tits.</v>

2041
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 5>These are base ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are base instincts that it's fine</v>

2042
01:43:12.881 --> 01:43:17.470
<v Speaker 5>if we observe them in Benobos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't want to see them in Harvard</v>

2043
01:43:17.471 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 5>educated kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2044
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 5>So the male gaze becomes problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2045
01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.200
<v Speaker 5>A man staring at a woman becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 5>microaggression.</v>

2046
01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:28.210
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's wearing almost nothing.</v>

2047
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:32.110
<v Speaker 5>She's got a short skirt on and painted</v>
<v Speaker 5>toes and you want to look.</v>

2048
01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.450
<v Speaker 5>You can't help yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The jeans come firing up.</v>

2049
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 5>You must suppress those because we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually moving past the flesh and you</v>

2050
01:43:38.891 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 5>are of the new generation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new generation that will someday be</v>

2051
01:43:41.891 --> 01:43:46.891
<v Speaker 5>neutered and there'll be some non binary</v>
<v Speaker 5>expression of your humanity that exists</v>

2052
01:43:47.981 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 5>as an Avatar and some virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 5>world that you'll be forced to subscribe</v>

2053
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 4>to when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you joined Yale,</v>

2054
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you talk about the male</v>

2055
01:43:56.511 --> 01:43:58.430
<v Speaker 4>gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if we've discussed this on</v>

2056
01:43:58.431 --> 01:44:02.480
<v Speaker 4>this show before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's precisely this type of thinking</v>

2057
01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:07.481
<v Speaker 4>that causes the western feminists to</v>
<v Speaker 4>view the Burka is liberating and the</v>

2058
01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:12.420
<v Speaker 4>bikini as a patriarchal oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2059
01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2060
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:17.930
<v Speaker 4>The to the extent that the male gaze as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a form of visual rape,</v>

2061
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:21.290
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that should be condemned.</v>

2062
01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:25.100
<v Speaker 4>That should be stopped because it is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>type of assault in quotes,</v>

2063
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:26.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Burka.</v>

2064
01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 4>By removing that male gaze becomes</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberating.</v>

2065
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not an argument that I'm making</v>

2066
01:44:31.011 --> 01:44:31.730
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2067
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:34.160
<v Speaker 4>I've heard this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>

2068
01:44:34.161 --> 01:44:39.161
<v Speaker 4>when a woman wears the Brazilian a Thong</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and I look at her and have the</v>

2069
01:44:39.171 --> 01:44:44.171
<v Speaker 4>exact same predictable response that</v>
<v Speaker 4>most men would have because it's an</v>

2070
01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 4>evolved response.</v>

2071
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.453
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2072
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:50.450
<v Speaker 4>that's bad because we are part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patriarchy and we are succumbing to this</v>

2073
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:51.650
<v Speaker 4>rape urge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2074
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:55.370
<v Speaker 4>So this is so when I talk about ostrich</v>
<v Speaker 4>parasitic syndrome,</v>

2075
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't just use it as a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's genuinely the case that people's</v>

2076
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:04.100
<v Speaker 4>minds are becoming infected with such</v>
<v Speaker 4>garbage that they're incapable to</v>

2077
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 4>rationalize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to think would reason.</v>

2078
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.840
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I ended up doing most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2079
01:45:08.841 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 4>That's what Jordan Peterson ends up</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing most of the time,</v>

2080
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:14.990
<v Speaker 4>which is we are committed to truth</v>
<v Speaker 4>unencumbered by political correctness.</v>

2081
01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Earlier you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be some,</v>

2082
01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can we get ourselves out of</v>

2083
01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 4>succumbing to this tribalism and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only way you could do it,</v>

2084
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:26.360
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying that anybody can</v>
<v Speaker 4>reach that level,</v>

2085
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:29.930
<v Speaker 4>is to simply be dedicated to the pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of truth.</v>

2086
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:33.060
<v Speaker 4>When I was on Sam Harris Show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2087
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:34.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier this year,</v>

2088
01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.080
<v Speaker 4>about six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven months ago,</v>

2089
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.700
<v Speaker 4>he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there any,</v>

2090
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:42.200
<v Speaker 4>a research question that you would not</v>
<v Speaker 4>tackle in your,</v>

2091
01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:45.140
<v Speaker 4>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your scientific career that is too</v>

2092
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 4>taboo?</v>

2093
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:47.750
<v Speaker 4>And my answer was no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2094
01:45:48.110 --> 01:45:53.090
<v Speaker 4>As long as you address the question</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly and objectively,</v>

2095
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:55.640
<v Speaker 4>there is nothing that should be off</v>
<v Speaker 4>limits,</v>

2096
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because then it becomes very easy to</v>

2097
01:45:56.991 --> 01:45:57.291
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2098
01:45:57.291 --> 01:45:59.480
<v Speaker 4>sex differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't study that because then it</v>

2099
01:45:59.481 --> 01:46:02.360
<v Speaker 4>will marginalize one sex or the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>race differences.</v>

2100
01:46:02.361 --> 01:46:04.370
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't study them for the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2101
01:46:04.371 --> 01:46:06.410
<v Speaker 4>So on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That becomes forbidden knowledge.</v>

2102
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:10.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest ideal that any honest person</v>

2103
01:46:10.311 --> 01:46:13.670
<v Speaker 4>should pursue is the pursuit of truth</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly an intellectual.</v>

2104
01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.370
<v Speaker 4>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be encumbered by political</v>

2105
01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:18.230
<v Speaker 4>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just pursue the truth.</v>

2106
01:46:18.231 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the reasons for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson's message and my message</v>

2107
01:46:22.191 --> 01:46:25.940
<v Speaker 4>has resonated now with a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because at least they see that we are</v>

2108
01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.540
<v Speaker 4>ascribing to that ideal to the best of</v>
<v Speaker 4>our abilities.</v>

2109
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:33.420
<v Speaker 4>What if that truth hurts your feelings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you're feeling.</v>

2110
01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm triggered.</v>

2111
01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:42.530
<v Speaker 4>I believe I used the f word was this</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2112
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:43.870
<v Speaker 4>I was an effect on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2114
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:48.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bunch of different things going</v>

2115
01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 4>on all at once and</v>

2116
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.520
<v Speaker 5>there's obviously some tribalism going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on even amongst these social justice</v>

2117
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 5>warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a virtue signaling people who are</v>

2118
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:03.890
<v Speaker 5>trying to get as much credit as much</v>
<v Speaker 5>social justice warrior street credit as</v>

2119
01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:08.370
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what happened with Bret Weinstein</v>

2120
01:47:08.371 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 5>up in Evergreen college and when I had</v>
<v Speaker 5>him on,</v>

2121
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:16.131
<v Speaker 5>I just read some recent thing where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doubling down on their hate of</v>

2122
01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:18.740
<v Speaker 5>him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2123
01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're accusing him of all of this by</v>

2124
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:25.920
<v Speaker 5>simply going on the Tucker Carlson show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2125
01:47:25.921 --> 01:47:28.590
<v Speaker 5>here's what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huffington post,</v>

2126
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 5>which is a really left leaning</v>
<v Speaker 5>establishment,</v>

2127
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:35.640
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if any website is left leaning,</v>

2128
01:47:35.641 --> 01:47:37.980
<v Speaker 5>it's Huffington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think they have some great</v>

2129
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:39.060
<v Speaker 5>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2130
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I'm not critical of all</v>
<v Speaker 5>their stuff,</v>

2131
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 5>but it's very left leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like openly regard.</v>

2132
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.640
<v Speaker 5>They had a piece breaking down how</v>
<v Speaker 5>preposterous these students are and the</v>

2133
01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 5>faculty and the president and what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have done to Bret Weinstein and</v>

2134
01:47:55.711 --> 01:48:00.711
<v Speaker 5>criticized each step of it by showing a</v>
<v Speaker 5>transcription of his conversation on the</v>

2135
01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:07.050
<v Speaker 5>Tucker Carlson show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which lasted like five minutes I think.</v>

2136
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they called Tucker Carlson alt right.</v>

2137
01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2138
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.040
<v Speaker 5>You redefining outright now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2139
01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I've been called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2140
01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Dave Rubin and I are leaders of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ultra.</v>

2141
01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.490
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're leaders.</v>

2142
01:48:20.491 --> 01:48:23.220
<v Speaker 5>We the actual leaders of the alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a tweet about this,</v>

2143
01:48:23.221 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 5>like the fact that they can call Dave</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rubin,</v>

2144
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:31.490
<v Speaker 5>who is a gay man who's married to a man</v>
<v Speaker 5>who used to be on the young Turks who's</v>

2145
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.260
<v Speaker 5>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is Jewish and I mean I guess I</v>

2146
01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:37.680
<v Speaker 5>called him a progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it progressive in the idea that he,</v>

2147
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.880
<v Speaker 5>he wants progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the real broad term of</v>

2148
01:48:41.881 --> 01:48:45.840
<v Speaker 5>progressive progress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning equality for all but honest,</v>

2149
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:48.990
<v Speaker 5>honest about the approach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would consider him probably more</v>

2150
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.200
<v Speaker 5>of a libertarian bent if you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get like political,</v>

2151
01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 5>which I guess I'm sort of in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of progressive slash libertarian left</v>

2152
01:48:57.481 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 5>leaning thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also believe in a lot of right</v>

2153
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.770
<v Speaker 5>things as well.</v>

2154
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:02.603
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2155
01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:05.130
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that competition is probably</v>

2156
01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:06.510
<v Speaker 5>ultimately good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2157
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:11.630
<v Speaker 5>And I think that blaming other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>for your lack of success is really easy</v>

2158
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 5>and it's something that people do all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

2159
01:49:13.831 --> 01:49:16.170
<v Speaker 5>But when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at things in that way,</v>

2160
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:21.410
<v Speaker 5>then you're diminishing the struggles</v>
<v Speaker 5>that downtrodden people and minorities</v>

2161
01:49:22.411 --> 01:49:24.860
<v Speaker 5>and the oppressed and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

2162
01:49:24.861 --> 01:49:25.694
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2163
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 5>small groups that have been somehow</v>
<v Speaker 5>another marginalized there.</v>

2164
01:49:30.421 --> 01:49:33.480
<v Speaker 5>You're diminishing their struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is absolutely not the case.</v>

2165
01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:38.280
<v Speaker 5>But there have been people that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>emerged from those groups and done</v>

2166
01:49:38.281 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 5>amazing things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Oh,</v>

2167
01:49:40.141 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 5>those are outliers and you can't hold</v>
<v Speaker 5>people up to the standards of those</v>

2168
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.360
<v Speaker 5>outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2169
01:49:45.361 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 5>the real problem is that the is stacked</v>

2170
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 3>in the favor of these white men who</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced white privilege.</v>

2171
01:49:51.881 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 3>And what we really need to do is squash</v>
<v Speaker 3>white men.</v>

2172
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2173
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory about all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2174
01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I called it collective Munchhausen.</v>

2175
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've said this before.</v>

2176
01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Please go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go again though.</v>

2177
01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I'd like this to stand alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2178
01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:13.990
<v Speaker 3>So remember how earlier I said that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest ideal should be the pursuit of</v>

2179
01:50:13.991 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2180
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 3>So the currency that I operate in is</v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuing truth.</v>

2181
01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Wherever that leads me a banker cares</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the bottom line.</v>

2182
01:50:21.251 --> 01:50:23.320
<v Speaker 3>How much money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many Zeros there are in his bank,</v>

2183
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:24.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my case.</v>

2184
01:50:24.461 --> 01:50:27.910
<v Speaker 3>It's truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in the social justice warriors</v>

2185
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:33.300
<v Speaker 3>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's how much eagle strokes he or she</v>

2186
01:50:33.521 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 3>gets by proclaiming unique victimhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>status.</v>

2187
01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I call this collective</v>

2188
01:50:38.741 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Munchhausen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 2010,</v>

2189
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I had published a paper in a medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>journal where I was looking at a</v>

2190
01:50:45.311 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 3>specific form of Munchhausen Syndrome as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychiatric condition where someone</v>

2191
01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.200
<v Speaker 3>feigns illness to get attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get empathy,</v>

2192
01:50:53.201 --> 01:50:54.034
<v Speaker 3>to get sympathy.</v>

2193
01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:56.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a real psychiatric condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lady who's got it.</v>

2194
01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2195
01:50:58.820 --> 01:50:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2196
01:50:59.730 --> 01:51:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I later I will write a Munchausen</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syndrome by proxy is a different</v>

2197
01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.440
<v Speaker 3>situation where you try to get your ego</v>
<v Speaker 3>stroked by harming someone else and then</v>

2198
01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:18.400
<v Speaker 3>getting the rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>

2199
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:19.600
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2200
01:51:19.601 --> 01:51:22.810
<v Speaker 3>at biological mother who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has this condition,</v>

2201
01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 3>you will harm your child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your biological child,</v>

2202
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.350
<v Speaker 3>so that then you could take him to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital and people say,</v>

2203
01:51:29.351 --> 01:51:30.131
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor you,</v>

2204
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:35.131
<v Speaker 3>you've got a sick alien child and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get your your or orgiastic</v>

2205
01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 3>orgasmic strokes by getting that</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and that empathy,</v>

2206
01:51:39.461 --> 01:51:42.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or You could do it if you have a pet or</v>

2207
01:51:42.191 --> 01:51:45.370
<v Speaker 3>sometimes with elderly parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but usually it's your biological child.</v>

2208
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:48.190
<v Speaker 3>So I was writing a paper trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain this from an evolutionary</v>

2209
01:51:48.191 --> 01:51:50.260
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how this pathology could arise,</v>

2210
01:51:50.590 --> 01:51:54.550
<v Speaker 3>and so that's how the psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndrome wasn't in my radar.</v>

2211
01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:59.680
<v Speaker 3>And then as I started seeing all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors navigating the</v>

2212
01:51:59.681 --> 01:52:02.260
<v Speaker 3>world through a game of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics,</v>

2213
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:07.270
<v Speaker 3>where the highest goal you can achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be declared the winner of the</v>

2214
01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.730
<v Speaker 3>oppression Olympics game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2215
01:52:09.731 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not the pursuit of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not making the most money.</v>

2216
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:16.450
<v Speaker 3>It's can I be anointed as the guy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest.</v>

2217
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 3>And I call this collective Munchhausen</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it becomes a form of</v>

2218
01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Munchhausen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the collective level.</v>

2219
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you another example as</v>

2220
01:52:24.991 --> 01:52:29.380
<v Speaker 3>voting for Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Donald Trump won the election,</v>

2221
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.160
<v Speaker 3>just on my facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>private personal facebook page,</v>

2222
01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I would see people outdoing each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost as if it were satirical in terms</v>

2223
01:52:39.641 --> 01:52:43.810
<v Speaker 3>of their collective Munchausen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a brown woman who was attending</v>

2224
01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:46.340
<v Speaker 3>this university now that Donald Trump</v>

2225
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 4>has won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid to go to classes.</v>

2226
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:51.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just think about how outrageous that</v>

2227
01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 4>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you may like or dislike Donald</v>

2228
01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you genuinely believe that your</v>

2229
01:52:57.051 --> 01:53:01.630
<v Speaker 4>ability to take classes and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit college and main is going to be</v>

2230
01:53:01.631 --> 01:53:04.430
<v Speaker 4>affected?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to experience personal</v>

2231
01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:09.010
<v Speaker 4>safety because Donald Trump is setting</v>
<v Speaker 4>up roadblocks so that he could create</v>

2232
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 4>internment camps for all women of color</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that they get gang raped.</v>

2233
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:15.920
<v Speaker 4>What is the fear that you have that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are literally right,</v>

2234
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 4>but they're testifying they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>testifying to and so it becomes this</v>

2235
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.480
<v Speaker 4>collective psychosis where the way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I win is by demonstrating that I am the</v>

2236
01:53:26.991 --> 01:53:29.510
<v Speaker 4>biggest victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's what social justice</v>

2237
01:53:29.511 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 4>warriors do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they have to win that game.</v>

2238
01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 4>And so there is no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Bret Weinstein example is those</v>

2239
01:53:37.341 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 4>guys seeking to win those Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you say that?</v>

2240
01:53:41.661 --> 01:53:44.570
<v Speaker 4>You could come on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you know what kinds of victims we</v>

2241
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 4>are and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2242
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:48.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a complete departure from reason.</v>

2243
01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:49.970
<v Speaker 4>It's grotesque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a psychiatric condition,</v>

2244
01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.190
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird</v>

2245
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:53.750
<v Speaker 5>prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is though,</v>

2246
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.840
<v Speaker 5>and how it's almost one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you as a professor are not really</v>

2247
01:53:58.971 --> 01:54:03.080
<v Speaker 5>allowed to discuss with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are exhibiting that behavior because</v>

2248
01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:05.520
<v Speaker 5>then you're diminishing their fear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2249
01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.050
<v Speaker 5>You're diminishing or marginalizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

2250
01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.350
<v Speaker 5>their own personal issues that they feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have.</v>

2251
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Except except because I always can pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>out my victimology card which usually</v>

2252
01:54:19.971 --> 01:54:24.860
<v Speaker 4>outranks all of them because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming while sitting at Wellesley</v>

2253
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:27.950
<v Speaker 4>paying $60,000 that they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>marginalized.</v>

2254
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I say I'm not sure if I can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic because let me tell you my</v>

2255
01:54:32.241 --> 01:54:33.580
<v Speaker 4>personal history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what,</v>

2256
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2257
01:54:33.730 --> 01:54:37.680
<v Speaker 5>Did with that guy and I'm in the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he accused you of genocide.</v>

2258
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.370
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've hit them with braces.</v>

2259
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.050
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like suck it stupid.</v>

2260
01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.580
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now</v>

2261
01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:43.503
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit.</v>

2262
01:54:43.630 --> 01:54:46.360
<v Speaker 4>The only way I could improve my score as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have jokingly said,</v>

2263
01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 4>is if I self identify as a woman,</v>

2264
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:52.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm transgendered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you shave though?</v>

2265
01:54:53.010 --> 01:54:56.220
<v Speaker 5>If you self identified as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you have to assume the appearance</v>

2266
01:54:56.221 --> 01:54:57.300
<v Speaker 5>of a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2267
01:54:57.301 --> 01:54:59.580
<v Speaker 5>if really appearances don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2268
01:54:59.610 --> 01:55:01.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a woman with a penis.</v>

2269
01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.750
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this whole idea that beauty</v>

2270
01:55:03.751 --> 01:55:07.290
<v Speaker 5>standards are bullshit and that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>constructed by the patriarchy.</v>

2271
01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.120
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you grow a big old Santa</v>
<v Speaker 5>Claus?</v>

2272
01:55:09.121 --> 01:55:11.040
<v Speaker 5>Beard steel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still identify with a woman.</v>

2273
01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm with you.</v>

2274
01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.190
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2275
01:55:14.191 --> 01:55:15.330
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's set the trend.</v>

2276
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:18.420
<v Speaker 5>But where do we draw the line though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I have no problem with someone</v>

2277
01:55:18.421 --> 01:55:20.310
<v Speaker 5>identifying as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to be a woman,</v>

2278
01:55:20.311 --> 01:55:22.410
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

2279
01:55:22.650 --> 01:55:23.251
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2280
01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:24.960
<v Speaker 5>where.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where do we draw the line though?</v>

2281
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:27.510
<v Speaker 5>Where are you allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are you?</v>

2282
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:30.660
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how out there can you get before I'm</v>

2283
01:55:30.661 --> 01:55:31.351
<v Speaker 5>allowed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2284
01:55:31.351 --> 01:55:32.790
<v Speaker 5>that guy might be fucking crazy.</v>

2285
01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard about this new?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this new,</v>

2286
01:55:34.901 --> 01:55:39.901
<v Speaker 4>I think called I think cis sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard this?</v>

2287
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I covered it in one of my sad</v>

2288
01:55:42.671 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

2289
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 3>basically the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

2290
01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.630
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a heterosexual male and CIS</v>

2291
01:55:49.631 --> 01:55:50.830
<v Speaker 3>gendered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2292
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Which is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a real expression,</v>

2293
01:55:53.401 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 3>but it is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'll all expressions are created by</v>

2294
01:55:55.411 --> 01:55:56.071
<v Speaker 3>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2295
01:55:56.071 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 3>So very true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some humans,</v>

2296
01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:02.190
<v Speaker 3>except so you and I wish to mate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

2297
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:04.320
<v Speaker 3>hence we are heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we?</v>

2298
01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>

2299
01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.080
<v Speaker 3>stay with me now at by you restricting</v>
<v Speaker 3>your preference to this old antiquated</v>

2300
01:56:17.730 --> 01:56:20.730
<v Speaker 3>term of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they have vaginas.</v>

2301
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 3>You're actually engaging in a form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIS,</v>

2302
01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:28.640
<v Speaker 3>CIS sexism because there are women who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have nine inch penises who should also</v>

2303
01:56:30.421 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 3>be privy to your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by you saying,</v>

2304
01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:36.780
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm attracted to women,</v>

2305
01:56:37.290 --> 01:56:39.780
<v Speaker 3>but only the women that are cis</v>
<v Speaker 3>gendered,</v>

2306
01:56:39.781 --> 01:56:43.680
<v Speaker 3>that have female genitalia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a form of CIS sexism.</v>

2307
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:48.510
<v Speaker 3>This idea is not being promulgated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you even saying that you have a</v>

2308
01:56:48.511 --> 01:56:53.511
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual orientation towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological women as a form of</v>

2309
01:56:53.671 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Transphobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not unlike by the way.</v>

2310
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Here's another example of racialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of this?</v>

2311
01:56:58.201 --> 01:56:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2312
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I love this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it fantastic?</v>

2313
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.880
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how far can we take this?</v>

2314
01:57:05.881 --> 01:57:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Like how we far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2315
01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So you think that you think the fulcrum</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not going to start swinging the other</v>

2316
01:57:10.741 --> 01:57:12.750
<v Speaker 3>way at some point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure it will.</v>

2317
01:57:12.751 --> 01:57:14.400
<v Speaker 3>And it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's one of the reasons</v>

2318
01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:17.400
<v Speaker 3>why Donald Trump got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is people are so upset with political</v>

2319
01:57:17.401 --> 01:57:19.740
<v Speaker 3>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went with the exact opposite,</v>

2320
01:57:19.741 --> 01:57:24.741
<v Speaker 3>which is buffoonery outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 3>braggadocious male buffoonery.</v>

2321
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it is.</v>

2322
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a braggadocious buffoon and in a</v>

2323
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 3>lot of respects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the way he talks about his</v>

2324
01:57:33.061 --> 01:57:37.410
<v Speaker 3>ratings and ones talks about himself in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third person,</v>

2325
01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was describing Kanye west and</v>

2326
01:57:39.781 --> 01:57:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Kanye loves trump mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine saying that about</v>

2327
01:57:42.841 --> 01:57:46.170
<v Speaker 3>yourself and describing yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 3>third person,</v>

2328
01:57:46.171 --> 01:57:47.850
<v Speaker 3>but a famous person loving you.</v>

2329
01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre.</v>

2330
01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:53.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people who follow me think that</v>

2331
01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I joked that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they think that I have these trump</v>

2332
01:57:56.881 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 3>posters in my room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's my big hero,</v>

2333
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:01.740
<v Speaker 3>which of course he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

2334
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I truly don't have a dog in this</v>

2335
01:58:03.751 --> 01:58:06.240
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they think that is</v>

2336
01:58:06.241 --> 01:58:10.650
<v Speaker 3>because I offered prior to the election</v>
<v Speaker 3>being done,</v>

2337
01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I offered some compelling reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological reasons why people might</v>

2338
01:58:16.351 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 3>vote for Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most famously,</v>

2339
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:23.331
<v Speaker 3>perhaps in my chat with Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I explained the psychological mechanisms</v>

2340
01:58:23.851 --> 01:58:27.840
<v Speaker 3>that could lead to otherwise perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable people to vote for trump,</v>

2341
01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:33.230
<v Speaker 3>simply proposing these was complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>unacceptable.</v>

2342
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:38.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Scott Adams and Scott Adams is lost</v>

2343
01:58:38.011 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars for simply stating</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he believes that Donald trump</v>

2344
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:46.110
<v Speaker 5>is a very persuasive person and</v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly predicting that that power of</v>

2345
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.340
<v Speaker 5>persuasion would allow him to win the</v>
<v Speaker 5>presidency.</v>

2346
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:50.860
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't even vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scott Adams says,</v>

2347
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:52.720
<v Speaker 5>because he talked so much about</v>
<v Speaker 5>politics,</v>

2348
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:54.250
<v Speaker 5>he does not want to have a dog in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>

2349
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:57.190
<v Speaker 5>so he doesn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He told me that on the podcast.</v>

2350
01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.410
<v Speaker 5>And so people think that he's a trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>supporter.</v>

2351
01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:01.120
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm absolutely not a trump supporter.</v>

2352
01:59:01.121 --> 01:59:03.070
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm analyzing the human beings.</v>

2353
01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so here's.</v>

2354
01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.620
<v Speaker 4>So just to kind of repeat what I told</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam.</v>

2355
01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.820
<v Speaker 4>So they are different decision rules</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one can use when they're making a</v>

2356
01:59:11.821 --> 01:59:13.420
<v Speaker 4>choice between different competing</v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative.</v>

2357
01:59:13.421 --> 01:59:15.150
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're choosing between cars,</v>

2358
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:17.820
<v Speaker 4>each car is defined by many attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2359
01:59:17.821 --> 01:59:21.030
<v Speaker 4>It's gas efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the power of its engine.</v>

2360
01:59:21.031 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 4>It's price and so on and so there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways that I could apply a</v>

2361
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:27.100
<v Speaker 4>decision rule and choosing between car</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2362
01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:29.730
<v Speaker 4>car b,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here's one rule I could look at,</v>

2363
01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 4>take all the attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them together,</v>

2364
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:34.350
<v Speaker 4>multiply them by the importance weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>of each attribute,</v>

2365
01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:37.830
<v Speaker 4>and pick the best product,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so using that decision rule,</v>

2366
01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:41.070
<v Speaker 4>maybe Hillary Clinton would have won</v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe if you put all the</v>

2367
01:59:41.071 --> 01:59:44.370
<v Speaker 4>attributes together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she ends up scoring higher than Donald</v>

2368
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's another the decision rule.</v>

2369
01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:49.590
<v Speaker 4>It's called the lexical graphic rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lexical graphical rule basically says,</v>

2370
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:52.560
<v Speaker 4>I simply look at my most important</v>
<v Speaker 4>attribute.</v>

2371
01:59:53.010 --> 01:59:56.820
<v Speaker 4>What's the attribute that I care most</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm making the choice within this</v>

2372
01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:59.970
<v Speaker 4>category,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I simply choose the alternative that</v>

2373
01:59:59.971 --> 02:00:02.280
<v Speaker 4>scores higher on that most important</v>
<v Speaker 4>attribute.</v>

2374
02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.100
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it were a cars,</v>

2375
02:00:05.370 --> 02:00:07.380
<v Speaker 4>I only care about the power of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>engine,</v>

2376
02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:10.440
<v Speaker 4>so I choose car a because it has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger power engine,</v>

2377
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the case of Donald Trump versus</v>

2378
02:00:12.841 --> 02:00:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suppose that my lexical graphic rule is</v>

2379
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:19.980
<v Speaker 4>I care only about the position on</v>
<v Speaker 4>immigration.</v>

2380
02:00:20.490 --> 02:00:23.310
<v Speaker 4>That's my decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing I look at.</v>

2381
02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very reasonable for people to think</v>

2382
02:00:25.711 --> 02:00:30.711
<v Speaker 4>that Donald trump had a more</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative view on immigration than</v>

2383
02:00:31.201 --> 02:00:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I use that decision rule,</v>

2384
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.900
<v Speaker 4>that psychological rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would choose Donald Trump.</v>

2385
02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:40.930
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't make me a guy who is</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping with my sister and I'm a tooth</v>

2386
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:43.500
<v Speaker 4>tooth toothless sky and Arkansas and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hick.</v>

2387
02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:47.850
<v Speaker 4>It simply means that I'm using a</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular decision rule that causes me</v>

2388
02:00:47.851 --> 02:00:49.770
<v Speaker 4>to choose Donald Trump over Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton.</v>

2389
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:51.420
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all I did,</v>

2390
02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:54.090
<v Speaker 4>not unlike what Scott Adams did his own</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2391
02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.890
<v Speaker 4>his offer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the different psychological processes by</v>

2392
02:00:58.891 --> 02:01:02.970
<v Speaker 4>which a very reasonable person can end</v>
<v Speaker 4>up choosing Donald trump rather than</v>

2393
02:01:02.971 --> 02:01:05.640
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's unbelievable.</v>

2394
02:01:05.641 --> 02:01:07.530
<v Speaker 4>The kind of flack I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy because it's,</v>

2395
02:01:07.531 --> 02:01:07.700
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

2396
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:10.110
<v Speaker 5>your absolute area of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2397
02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:12.500
<v Speaker 5>it's what your education is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what you teach.</v>

2398
02:01:12.501 --> 02:01:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so strange that if it doesn't jive</v>

2399
02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:20.120
<v Speaker 5>with people's belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get upset at you for teaching</v>

2400
02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:22.220
<v Speaker 5>something that's science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2401
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call this by the way,</v>

2402
02:01:23.421 --> 02:01:24.260
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

2403
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.970
<v Speaker 5>I used to love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got sad,</v>

2404
02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:29.570
<v Speaker 5>but roof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I used to love you got sat,</v>

2405
02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 5>but trump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate you,</v>

2406
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:33.380
<v Speaker 5>but I just love saying that though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to stay,</v>

2407
02:01:33.381 --> 02:01:36.860
<v Speaker 5>love saying that they love to try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>instill a seed of regret.</v>

2408
02:01:36.861 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 5>Not just criticism but regret because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's more painful,</v>

2409
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like to say,</v>

2410
02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 5>I just think you're a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2411
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:44.960
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well fuck you.</v>

2412
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:46.370
<v Speaker 5>You're not my fan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into you.</v>

2413
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:51.400
<v Speaker 5>What's the number one source of flack</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you receive from your gigantic fan</v>

2414
02:01:51.521 --> 02:01:53.970
<v Speaker 5>base?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2415
02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.430
<v Speaker 5>the one issue that triggers the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal to you.</v>

2416
02:01:58.880 --> 02:01:59.900
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2417
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 5>To me like personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2418
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 5>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're a great guy,</v>

2419
02:02:03.801 --> 02:02:06.500
<v Speaker 5>but my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're such an idiot because of x.</v>

2420
02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:09.310
<v Speaker 5>what's x?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many things we did.</v>

2421
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 5>We did a three hour podcasts just to</v>
<v Speaker 5>name them all.</v>

2422
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:15.050
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot of facts wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of things I remember incorrectly</v>

2423
02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.660
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of these free form</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations,</v>

2424
02:02:17.661 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 5>like we're having a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not planned out.</v>

2425
02:02:20.301 --> 02:02:22.310
<v Speaker 5>The subjects aren't planned out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular,</v>

2426
02:02:22.311 --> 02:02:26.240
<v Speaker 5>like the divergent paths that we take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes we'll go down a path and I'll</v>

2427
02:02:26.241 --> 02:02:29.090
<v Speaker 5>go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was that story about that thing,</v>

2428
02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:32.530
<v Speaker 5>and I'll get that shit wrong all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time because there's just,</v>

2429
02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as good as my memory is and it's pretty</v>

2430
02:02:34.341 --> 02:02:38.000
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just a certain amount of data</v>

2431
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:41.840
<v Speaker 5>that you could instantaneously call up</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the.</v>

2432
02:02:41.841 --> 02:02:45.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you ask me questions about</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain things that are in my constant</v>

2433
02:02:45.741 --> 02:02:48.560
<v Speaker 5>day to day existence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe perhaps standup comedy or</v>

2434
02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:49.670
<v Speaker 5>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

2435
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.780
<v Speaker 5>I can give you a staggering amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>information off the top of my head,</v>

2436
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2437
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 5>we talk about in these podcasts.</v>

2438
02:02:58.190 --> 02:02:59.570
<v Speaker 5>It's just people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2439
02:02:59.571 --> 02:03:00.680
<v Speaker 5>you should have prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2440
02:03:00.681 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it because it's no,</v>

2441
02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:05.000
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation so interesting.</v>

2442
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.270
<v Speaker 5>So in that sense I'm giving myself would</v>
<v Speaker 5>get out of jail free pass.</v>

2443
02:03:08.271 --> 02:03:10.860
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

2444
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:12.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean getting things wrong is probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big one.</v>

2445
02:03:12.741 --> 02:03:13.790
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2446
02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:15.860
<v Speaker 5>Talking over people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being a meathead,</v>

2447
02:03:16.150 --> 02:03:19.850
<v Speaker 5>all those things I'm guilty of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think probably the number one thing</v>

2448
02:03:19.851 --> 02:03:24.380
<v Speaker 5>for me over the past few months has been</v>
<v Speaker 5>this trump thing where people simply</v>

2449
02:03:24.381 --> 02:03:27.110
<v Speaker 5>can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think I'm his waterboy,</v>

2450
02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 5>which of course I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm simply saying,</v>

2451
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:30.020
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2452
02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:33.350
<v Speaker 5>very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People could have converged to a trump</v>

2453
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:34.670
<v Speaker 5>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vote,</v>

2454
02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.120
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think that's like one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>those 140 character criticisms?</v>

2455
02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:40.160
<v Speaker 5>Like it's really like I've been called a</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump supporter.</v>

2456
02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:43.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm 100 percent not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because of the fact that it's a</v>

2457
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:45.550
<v Speaker 5>cruel thing to say to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2458
02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:46.490
<v Speaker 5>still loving trump.</v>

2459
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:47.570
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking idiot.</v>

2460
02:03:47.571 --> 02:03:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Like loving trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2461
02:03:49.341 --> 02:03:52.350
<v Speaker 5>What am I gonna have a seven minute long</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit about him in my act,</v>

2462
02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.540
<v Speaker 5>like loving them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you talking about it?</v>

2463
02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:58.400
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't matter because by saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they could diminish you.</v>

2464
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:59.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a racist,</v>

2465
02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:00.411
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2466
02:04:00.411 --> 02:04:01.740
<v Speaker 5>you're a sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2467
02:04:01.810 --> 02:04:02.171
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2468
02:04:02.171 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 5>you're like the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the craziest ones is someone.</v>

2469
02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:10.660
<v Speaker 5>If someone gets unfairly or unjustly or</v>
<v Speaker 5>inaccurately accused of rape,</v>

2470
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:15.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Immediately that person's a rapist and</v>

2471
02:04:15.711 --> 02:04:20.540
<v Speaker 5>they did it and it is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult to exonerate yourself from</v>

2472
02:04:20.541 --> 02:04:22.790
<v Speaker 5>that and people that had been accused of</v>
<v Speaker 5>rape.</v>

2473
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean not people like bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get accused of it 50 fucking times or</v>

2474
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 5>something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've known people that were accused</v>

2475
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:34.280
<v Speaker 5>of rape and it was all a lie and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>

2476
02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 5>It was done by an ex and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who is a scorned lover</v>

2477
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:43.250
<v Speaker 2>and it was angry and they wanted to cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst possible light on this person</v>

2478
02:04:43.381 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>in order to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them some tastes of the pain that</v>

2479
02:04:46.561 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>they feel from rejection or from</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>

2480
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>And this is not uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know what the statistics</v>

2481
02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:58.731
<v Speaker 2>are as far as a false rape accusations</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus actual rape versus people who</v>

2482
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 2>were raped who don't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either one does not invalidate the</v>

2483
02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By saying that a lot of women actually</v>

2484
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:07.770
<v Speaker 2>have been raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which neither you nor I would ever argue</v>

2485
02:05:07.771 --> 02:05:08.604
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2486
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>and it's a horrible crime and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible fucking thing to do to a person</v>

2487
02:05:13.261 --> 02:05:16.050
<v Speaker 2>to take away their humanity in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does not.</v>

2488
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:20.460
<v Speaker 2>That does not somehow or another make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2489
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.760
<v Speaker 2>That people have false rape accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2490
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 2>that's a horrific thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can quantify what's worse or</v>

2491
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 2>what's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2492
02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 2>and I think we would all agree that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably worse to be physically raped</v>

2493
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:36.390
<v Speaker 2>than it is to be accused of rape when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't do it,</v>

2494
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but they're both gross.</v>

2495
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.400
<v Speaker 2>But you have these things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually written about this.</v>

2496
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the punishments for</v>
<v Speaker 2>false accusations of rape are too lax?</v>

2497
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Because I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they don't know what they</v>

2498
02:05:49.831 --> 02:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that they should be</v>

2499
02:05:51.691 --> 02:05:53.010
<v Speaker 2>pretty horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2500
02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Almost to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost the same amount of what he would</v>

2501
02:05:57.121 --> 02:05:59.120
<v Speaker 2>have spent in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2502
02:05:59.130 --> 02:06:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe like 70 percent I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think false rape accusations,</v>

2503
02:06:03.751 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 2>especially if you like really chase it</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and try to give this person locked</v>

2504
02:06:07.441 --> 02:06:10.680
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so much wrong with that.</v>

2505
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:14.640
<v Speaker 2>It might be like 70 percent of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent,</v>

2506
02:06:14.641 --> 02:06:16.440
<v Speaker 2>meaning like 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>

2507
02:06:16.650 --> 02:06:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say a number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's as bad as physically</v>

2508
02:06:19.921 --> 02:06:22.380
<v Speaker 2>raping someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in the neighborhood.</v>

2509
02:06:22.381 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 2>But I mean think of it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to get too philosophical everyday</v>

2510
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>that a guy spends in prison as a falsely</v>
<v Speaker 2>accused rapist while you,</v>

2511
02:06:31.861 --> 02:06:34.860
<v Speaker 2>the woman who falsely accused him is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in your house.</v>

2512
02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean you are a quote committing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime every day of his life,</v>

2513
02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>every everyday that you don't step</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

2514
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.260
<v Speaker 2>punishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punishing,</v>

2515
02:06:43.261 --> 02:06:43.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2516
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to diminish that one act of rape,</v>

2517
02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but you are raping this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically every if not literally</v>

2518
02:06:50.641 --> 02:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>because he probably is going to be raped</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prison for having that accusation on</v>

2519
02:06:55.561 --> 02:06:56.394
<v Speaker 2>top of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2520
02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a targeted person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive person,</v>

2521
02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 2>so in a sense you're almost as</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabolical as a true rapist because you</v>

2522
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>are living with that false information</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyday you're going to buy your</v>

2523
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:12.180
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes and groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unencumbered by the fact that there is a</v>

2524
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 2>guy sitting in prison who was probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>passing some very ugly moments because</v>

2525
02:07:17.161 --> 02:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you are unwilling to correct the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've done,</v>

2526
02:07:19.801 --> 02:07:22.590
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's a pretty diabolical</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who does that.</v>

2527
02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:24.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a diabolical person.</v>

2528
02:07:24.841 --> 02:07:27.930
<v Speaker 2>The problem is whenever you bring up</v>
<v Speaker 2>this diabolical person,</v>

2529
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you automatically get lumped in with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who has some sort of an enabler,</v>

2530
02:07:33.151 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>some cis gendered male</v>

2531
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.250
<v Speaker 5>privileged piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't care about actual rape</v>

2532
02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 5>victims because you're more concerned</v>
<v Speaker 5>with men who get falsely accused of</v>

2533
02:07:42.491 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 5>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just another thing.</v>

2534
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:47.410
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not diminishing the actual crime of</v>

2535
02:07:47.411 --> 02:07:49.150
<v Speaker 5>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the worst things in the</v>

2536
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:51.400
<v Speaker 5>world next to murder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a horrific,</v>

2537
02:07:51.401 --> 02:07:56.170
<v Speaker 5>terrifying aspect of human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're even capable of doing that,</v>

2538
02:07:56.710 --> 02:08:01.710
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't mean that false rape</v>
<v Speaker 5>accusations aren't also a horrific</v>

2539
02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 5>aspect of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just a lot of shitty behavior</v>

2540
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:09.880
<v Speaker 5>that people exhibit and as soon as we</v>
<v Speaker 5>lock ourselves into these,</v>

2541
02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 5>these little groups that will always</v>
<v Speaker 5>blindly support.</v>

2542
02:08:14.410 --> 02:08:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Like I have this bit I've been doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>lately about a bumper sticker.</v>

2543
02:08:17.411 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 5>I saw a girl's car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it said girls kick ass.</v>

2544
02:08:20.850 --> 02:08:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Like you imagine if a guy had a bumper</v>
<v Speaker 5>sticker that said boys kick ass.</v>

2545
02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:28.810
<v Speaker 5>It's so you're signing off on $160</v>
<v Speaker 5>million people.</v>

2546
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:32.320
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's one of those things where we'll</v>

2547
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:37.321
<v Speaker 5>allow that because we all agree that</v>
<v Speaker 5>women have a harder go of it in this</v>

2548
02:08:38.441 --> 02:08:41.110
<v Speaker 5>country in particular and other</v>
<v Speaker 5>countries far more so.</v>

2549
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we could go back to ideology for the</v>

2550
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:45.730
<v Speaker 5>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we're talking to</v>

2551
02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:46.970
<v Speaker 4>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2552
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:48.710
<v Speaker 4>speaking of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2553
02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:50.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we've mentioned this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone on this show,</v>

2554
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:53.090
<v Speaker 4>a two of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of whom I know.</v>

2555
02:08:53.091 --> 02:08:53.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other one,</v>

2556
02:08:53.721 --> 02:08:58.721
<v Speaker 4>not so much if at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book around 2000 or 2002,</v>

2557
02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:04.130
<v Speaker 4>offering an adaptive evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation for rape he had.</v>

2558
02:09:04.131 --> 02:09:05.760
<v Speaker 4>There Ya go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to hear anything more</v>

2559
02:09:05.761 --> 02:09:06.690
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2560
02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:08.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2561
02:09:08.541 --> 02:09:12.680
<v Speaker 4>So actually I'll tell you their names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Randy Thornhill,</v>

2562
02:09:12.681 --> 02:09:14.360
<v Speaker 4>who's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very serious scientists,</v>

2563
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:16.610
<v Speaker 4>and Craig Palmer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wrote a book,</v>

2564
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:21.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in 2000 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't of course,</v>

2565
02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.570
<v Speaker 4>justifying rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>condoning it.</v>

2566
02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:24.621
<v Speaker 4>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2567
02:09:24.621 --> 02:09:29.570
<v Speaker 4>if you wish to understand rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you better have a good scientific</v>

2568
02:09:29.571 --> 02:09:33.970
<v Speaker 4>basis for why it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and therefore they offered something</v>

2569
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:35.240
<v Speaker 4>adaptive argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which by the way,</v>

2570
02:09:35.241 --> 02:09:37.040
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the main things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will hate.</v>

2571
02:09:37.041 --> 02:09:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Evolution psychology commit as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fallacy.</v>

2572
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:41.720
<v Speaker 4>They think that when you explain a</v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon,</v>

2573
02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:44.870
<v Speaker 4>you are justifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you explain why men and women</v>

2574
02:09:44.871 --> 02:09:48.350
<v Speaker 4>might cheat on one another and</v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamous unions or you're offering a</v>

2575
02:09:48.351 --> 02:09:50.720
<v Speaker 4>scientific justification for cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're not.</v>

2576
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My rebuttal is the guy who studies</v>

2577
02:09:54.051 --> 02:09:55.490
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an oncologist.</v>

2578
02:09:55.670 --> 02:09:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean he is for pancreatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer?</v>

2579
02:09:57.651 --> 02:09:58.640
<v Speaker 4>He's justifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2580
02:09:58.641 --> 02:10:01.250
<v Speaker 4>he's just trying to explain why</v>
<v Speaker 4>pancreatic cancer happens.</v>

2581
02:10:01.251 --> 02:10:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Is that across</v>

2582
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:02.750
<v Speaker 5>the board though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2583
02:10:02.751 --> 02:10:07.751
<v Speaker 5>what if you try to explain why people</v>
<v Speaker 5>commit violent crimes or explain why</v>

2584
02:10:08.181 --> 02:10:10.580
<v Speaker 5>people steal things from stores?</v>

2585
02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.680
<v Speaker 4>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are certain phenomena that</v>

2586
02:10:14.681 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 4>triggered that response more than others</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an open empirical question.</v>

2587
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:22.000
<v Speaker 4>What's the quality of the phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 4>that causes you to react that way or</v>

2588
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:22.460
<v Speaker 4>not?</v>

2589
02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that it's most likely the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stronger person who seems to have the</v>

2590
02:10:26.331 --> 02:10:31.100
<v Speaker 5>privilege victimizing the weaker person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps males versus females,</v>

2591
02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:32.360
<v Speaker 4>child abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one.</v>

2592
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 4>So actually feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2593
02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:35.300
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the book,</v>

2594
02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:38.390
<v Speaker 4>so the book that got me into</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology,</v>

2595
02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2596
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:41.510
<v Speaker 4>I've mentioned this story before and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not on the show.</v>

2597
02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 4>It was my first semester as a doctoral</v>
<v Speaker 4>student at Cornell and the professor,</v>

2598
02:10:46.221 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 4>this was an advanced social psychology</v>
<v Speaker 4>course and the professor assigned the</v>

2599
02:10:48.831 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 4>book called homicide by two pioneers of</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology,</v>

2600
02:10:53.301 --> 02:10:57.260
<v Speaker 4>husband and wife team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Margo Wilson and Martin Daly where the</v>

2601
02:10:57.261 --> 02:11:02.261
<v Speaker 4>book is about understanding patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminality via an evolutionary lens.</v>

2602
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:08.050
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things in the book that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had struck me as so powerful was looking</v>

2603
02:11:08.781 --> 02:11:13.781
<v Speaker 4>at child abuse in the home and then the</v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstration that there's a very clear</v>

2604
02:11:14.001 --> 02:11:17.460
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary reason why that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me ask you that.</v>

2605
02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.250
<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We discussed this before in this show.</v>

2606
02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:20.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't recall.</v>

2607
02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Can you guess at all?</v>

2608
02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the number one greatest</v>

2609
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:30.890
<v Speaker 4>predictor of there being a child abuse</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the home?</v>

2610
02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.000
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>

2611
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.200
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's poverty.</v>

2612
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:36.860
<v Speaker 4>You might say it's probably parents that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were abused as children.</v>

2613
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.230
<v Speaker 4>No bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bigger than that,</v>

2614
02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:44.231
<v Speaker 4>much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one factor is 100 fold greater</v>

2615
02:11:44.361 --> 02:11:45.210
<v Speaker 4>than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>

2616
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 4>typically when you say a what's called</v>
<v Speaker 4>an odds,</v>

2617
02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:52.730
<v Speaker 4>likelihood ratio one point two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have a 20 percent greater chance</v>

2618
02:11:52.731 --> 02:11:57.110
<v Speaker 4>of getting cancer if you smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just having one point,</v>

2619
02:11:57.111 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 4>two greater odds is considered a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>number here.</v>

2620
02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:03.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you a hundred fold greater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's something that's almost never</v>

2621
02:12:03.411 --> 02:12:07.400
<v Speaker 4>seen in science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does having a step parent in the</v>

2622
02:12:07.401 --> 02:12:11.510
<v Speaker 4>home</v>
<v Speaker 4>now think again here,</v>

2623
02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 4>another animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to get the people who don't like 100</v>

2624
02:12:15.531 --> 02:12:16.970
<v Speaker 4>times greater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is this.</v>

2625
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:22.190
<v Speaker 4>So actually it's now been called the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cinderella effect because their Ela,</v>

2626
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2627
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:24.490
<v Speaker 4>She shows the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2628
02:12:24.491 --> 02:12:29.491
<v Speaker 4>the evil step mother loves her two</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological daughters but hates the</v>

2629
02:12:30.141 --> 02:12:32.150
<v Speaker 4>stepdaughter Cinderella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's okay.</v>

2630
02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Now think about with lions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2631
02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:39.980
<v Speaker 4>In a lion pride,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a one or two dominant males who</v>

2632
02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.930
<v Speaker 4>who control and protect the pride and</v>
<v Speaker 4>who control sexual access to the</v>

2633
02:12:44.931 --> 02:12:49.460
<v Speaker 4>females.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's constant testing of these males</v>

2634
02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:54.760
<v Speaker 4>by bands of young males who are looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take over and for awhile the resident</v>

2635
02:12:55.071 --> 02:12:59.810
<v Speaker 4>males went out and then eventually they</v>
<v Speaker 4>lose when they lose and they're either</v>

2636
02:12:59.811 --> 02:13:04.811
<v Speaker 4>killed or banished from the pride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the first thing that the new</v>

2637
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:08.060
<v Speaker 4>incoming bosses do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill the boobies.</v>

2638
02:13:08.210 --> 02:13:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill the babies.</v>

2639
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:14.550
<v Speaker 4>What happens to the females that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lionesses one,</v>

2640
02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.620
<v Speaker 4>they killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go into estrus,</v>

2641
02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead of playing Barry White Music</v>

2642
02:13:20.031 --> 02:13:23.000
<v Speaker 4>and the violin to get them in the mood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed their children and they get in</v>

2643
02:13:23.001 --> 02:13:23.451
<v Speaker 4>the mood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2644
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:24.590
<v Speaker 4>Nature is brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2645
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the context of humans,</v>

2646
02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:31.900
<v Speaker 4>when you have a step parent who is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>biologically linked</v>

2647
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>to the child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it simply increases the likelihood of</v>

2648
02:13:35.731 --> 02:13:39.840
<v Speaker 3>there being abuse right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now usually when you explain this,</v>

2649
02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.610
<v Speaker 3>what is the first thing that people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2650
02:13:41.611 --> 02:13:44.100
<v Speaker 3>well I grew up with a stepfather and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do this to me.</v>

2651
02:13:44.101 --> 02:13:46.060
<v Speaker 3>You're an asshole or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2652
02:13:46.210 --> 02:13:48.660
<v Speaker 3>but what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means it's okay to do it because</v>

2653
02:13:48.661 --> 02:13:52.350
<v Speaker 3>you're explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look how they can flate explaining a</v>

2654
02:13:52.351 --> 02:13:54.900
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon with justifying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

2655
02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.040
<v Speaker 3>So I think rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>child abuse and probably marital</v>

2656
02:13:59.041 --> 02:14:04.041
<v Speaker 3>infidelity are the three evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that when you explain using an</v>

2657
02:14:04.831 --> 02:14:06.990
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go completely Wacko.</v>

2658
02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

2659
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that it's.</v>

2660
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:15.460
<v Speaker 3>You almost can't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>

2661
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Forbidden in Islam village as per my</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with Sam Harris,</v>

2662
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:22.830
<v Speaker 3>avoid that topic because you'll get too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much flack and that's dangerous.</v>

2663
02:14:22.831 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Nothing should be forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these scientists that wrote this</v>

2664
02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:27.420
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they were examining rape and the</v>

2665
02:14:27.421 --> 02:14:29.850
<v Speaker 3>causes of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the repercussions?</v>

2666
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was invited.</v>

2667
02:14:32.221 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 3>So around the Thorn Hill is at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of New Mexico and he's still</v>

2668
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:37.260
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>

2669
02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 3>When when he invited me to his group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invited me to give a talk at the</v>

2670
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:44.610
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and I went out for a while and I</v>

2671
02:14:44.611 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 3>asked him that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said at one point there had to be</v>

2672
02:14:47.491 --> 02:14:52.491
<v Speaker 3>constant police patrols because of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the death threats and so on that he,</v>

2673
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:55.580
<v Speaker 3>that he was getting nih.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect that at this point in a</v>

2674
02:14:55.581 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 3>subsided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 15,</v>

2675
02:14:57.211 --> 02:15:00.240
<v Speaker 3>16 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the book first came out,</v>

2676
02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 3>it was dangerous to be around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thornhill.</v>

2677
02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so bizarre where people that you</v>

2678
02:15:04.831 --> 02:15:06.210
<v Speaker 3>would think of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2679
02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:08.790
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you think of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are liberal and progressive,</v>

2680
02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:12.360
<v Speaker 3>you think these are nonviolent folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just want peace and happiness and</v>

2681
02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look what happened in Evergreen.</v>

2682
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what Bret Weinstein</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about,</v>

2683
02:15:17.131 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 3>the threats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden you've got</v>

2684
02:15:19.021 --> 02:15:23.280
<v Speaker 3>vigilante patrols with tasers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball bats and these are kids that</v>

2685
02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:26.910
<v Speaker 3>are running around trying to justify</v>
<v Speaker 3>using violence because someone doesn't</v>

2686
02:15:26.911 --> 02:15:30.510
<v Speaker 3>agree with their thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole idea of it was a day of</v>

2687
02:15:30.511 --> 02:15:32.880
<v Speaker 3>absence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day of inclusion or does it day of</v>

2688
02:15:32.881 --> 02:15:33.714
<v Speaker 3>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2689
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:37.940
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea was that white people</v>
<v Speaker 3>should stay home just once.</v>

2690
02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:39.450
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking racist,</v>

2691
02:15:39.451 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 3>like you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

2692
02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:45.720
<v Speaker 3>as he self describes as a deeply</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive person in all my</v>

2693
02:15:45.721 --> 02:15:49.440
<v Speaker 3>conversations with him indicate that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge way.</v>

2694
02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just a really open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive guy who he doesn't,</v>

2695
02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:57.570
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't want racism against white</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to exist any more than he wants</v>

2696
02:15:57.571 --> 02:15:59.550
<v Speaker 3>it against black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But by the way,</v>

2697
02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he came on my show too.</v>

2698
02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:05.760
<v Speaker 3>We had a great chat and second hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now interrupted.</v>

2699
02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:06.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2700
02:16:06.031 --> 02:16:07.420
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2701
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if full hiding,</v>

2702
02:16:10.111 --> 02:16:14.010
<v Speaker 3>but he certainly not on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he said.</v>

2703
02:16:14.011 --> 02:16:15.880
<v Speaker 3>He had to move his family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2704
02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Even know where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe I shouldn't say weird.</v>

2705
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2706
02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the comments section,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if the same thing happened when</v>

2707
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:27.600
<v Speaker 3>he came on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed at the animus that he was</v>

2708
02:16:27.601 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>being levied at him from people who were</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2709
02:16:30.311 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is part of the problem.</v>

2710
02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:37.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a progressive who created the</v>
<v Speaker 3>monster that is now biting his ass,</v>

2711
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:41.480
<v Speaker 3>and so let him let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let let the snake and so on.</v>

2712
02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Charitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't get.</v>

2713
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:43.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get that,</v>

2714
02:16:43.811 --> 02:16:48.760
<v Speaker 3>but I do understand why fools would</v>
<v Speaker 3>think because he's not real true.</v>

2715
02:16:48.761 --> 02:16:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Progressives like non ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>based progressive.</v>

2716
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:53.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2717
02:16:53.310 --> 02:16:55.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing to note until the</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that,</v>

2718
02:16:55.691 --> 02:16:57.790
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should all be the same regardless of</v>

2719
02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:00.910
<v Speaker 3>your dreadlocks or a shaved head or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're white or black or.</v>

2720
02:17:01.390 --> 02:17:04.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sexual preference.</v>

2721
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if a man is only sexually attracted</v>

2722
02:17:08.741 --> 02:17:11.440
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he says I am sexually attractive,</v>

2723
02:17:11.441 --> 02:17:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I prefer white women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a fucking racist.</v>

2724
02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 3>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer black women.</v>

2725
02:17:17.170 --> 02:17:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Like Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spice it weird.</v>

2726
02:17:19.810 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2727
02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:22.320
<v Speaker 3>this cuts both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2728
02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:27.360
<v Speaker 3>and I actually commented on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say I'm attracted to overweight</v>

2729
02:17:27.611 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are objectifying and fetishizing are</v>

2730
02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:35.620
<v Speaker 3>corpulent bodies or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they'll say.</v>

2731
02:17:35.970 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 3>That's what they'll sell the</v>
<v Speaker 3>complainer's I should be happy.</v>

2732
02:17:38.141 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Somebody likes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say I don't like fat women</v>

2733
02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then of course you're,</v>

2734
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you're so.</v>

2735
02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with black women,</v>

2736
02:17:45.941 --> 02:17:46.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

2737
02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have a preference for black</v>

2738
02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:49.480
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2739
02:17:49.481 --> 02:17:52.810
<v Speaker 3>It's the old stereotype of the sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>black woman with a beautiful behind.</v>

2740
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:54.730
<v Speaker 3>You're objectifying us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're racist.</v>

2741
02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2742
02:17:55.991 --> 02:17:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I really don't like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2743
02:17:57.461 --> 02:17:59.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body types of black women.</v>

2744
02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I prefer Asian women while you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

2745
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 3>So all roads lead to you being an</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

2746
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.890
<v Speaker 3>If you like them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>

2747
02:18:05.891 --> 02:18:07.030
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>

2748
02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 3>What if you just say you just enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>dating black women because of the way</v>

2749
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:14.070
<v Speaker 3>the communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some race,</v>

2750
02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.130
<v Speaker 3>someone will probably accusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen at correcting somebody for their</v>

2751
02:18:18.131 --> 02:18:21.460
<v Speaker 3>grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's part of their dialect is racist.</v>

2752
02:18:21.461 --> 02:18:23.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Ebonics.</v>

2753
02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:24.433
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2754
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I was coming when we were coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to a song by a see</v>

2755
02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Sierra Sierra general.</v>

2756
02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.470
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2757
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:35.290
<v Speaker 3>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a hip hop singer and at one point</v>

2758
02:18:35.291 --> 02:18:37.930
<v Speaker 3>in one of the songs she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you is.</v>

2759
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:40.000
<v Speaker 3>There you is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I told my wife,</v>

2760
02:18:40.001 --> 02:18:40.781
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2761
02:18:40.781 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 3>it really pisses me off when they commit</v>
<v Speaker 3>these grammatical errors.</v>

2762
02:18:43.970 --> 02:18:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that an art thing?</v>

2763
02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I might say something</v>
<v Speaker 3>grammatically incorrect on stage,</v>

2764
02:18:48.761 --> 02:18:50.770
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funnier than saying it correctly.</v>

2765
02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2766
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:55.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing it because it is part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of the contextualized shtick,</v>

2767
02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:58.000
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that what she's kind of doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rap song?</v>

2768
02:18:58.210 --> 02:18:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2769
02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:00.410
<v Speaker 3>It's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2770
02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it just rhymes better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you are.</v>

2771
02:19:02.831 --> 02:19:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Don't say there you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if it's.</v>

2772
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to run what rhymes with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fizz fizz.</v>

2773
02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't sit in champagne.</v>

2774
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Get my fears it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look over there.</v>

2775
02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:16.210
<v Speaker 3>There you is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should have been a rapper,</v>

2776
02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:16.991
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2777
02:19:16.991 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 3>you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said that.</v>

2778
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:21.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that you were attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>black women.</v>

2779
02:19:21.311 --> 02:19:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Might be racist or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear the latest with the new,</v>

2780
02:19:24.341 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letter that was uncovered from Tupac</v>

2781
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Shakur to a white chicks that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2782
02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.740
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he broke up with her because she</v>

2783
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:35.990
<v Speaker 3>was a white woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke up with Madonna.</v>

2784
02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:36.883
<v Speaker 3>Madonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2785
02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:40.130
<v Speaker 3>She was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just trying to find an excuse.</v>

2786
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:42.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't ever change,</v>

2787
02:19:42.670 --> 02:19:44.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't change the fact that you're</v>

2788
02:19:44.121 --> 02:19:45.620
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

2789
02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:47.630
<v Speaker 3>But imagine that the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2790
02:19:47.631 --> 02:19:48.230
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2791
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:50.570
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she had written him a letter saying,</v>

2792
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:51.440
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear Tupac,</v>

2793
02:19:51.441 --> 02:19:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I would have loved to continue this</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

2794
02:19:52.911 --> 02:19:55.880
<v Speaker 3>but given that you're a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her career would be over.</v>

2795
02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:59.180
<v Speaker 3>But him saying it to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually said,</v>

2796
02:19:59.181 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2797
02:20:00.470 --> 02:20:03.020
<v Speaker 3>if you date me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it appears as though you're an exciting</v>

2798
02:20:03.021 --> 02:20:05.750
<v Speaker 3>cool woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I continue to date you,</v>

2799
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:08.210
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the people that made me who I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am would,</v>

2800
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>I would lose credit with the credit.</v>

2801
02:20:11.350 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was thrown that posted correctly.</v>

2802
02:20:13.431 --> 02:20:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Probably still would have stuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's probably annoying.</v>

2803
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 3>She probably talks too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably talks about herself in the</v>

2804
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:25.400
<v Speaker 3>third person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump probably likes you.</v>

2805
02:20:25.470 --> 02:20:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to admit something now that's</v>

2806
02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 3>going to come back to the hotline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2807
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My cousin and I.</v>

2808
02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>

2809
02:20:35.430 --> 02:20:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Drove to Toronto to see Madonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have done that.</v>

2810
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a fantastic performer.</v>

2811
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:45.290
<v Speaker 3>She was a huge superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still kind of is.</v>

2812
02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm just joking around about being her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her being annoying.</v>

2813
02:20:47.691 --> 02:20:50.840
<v Speaker 3>It's just a funny thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always big madonna fan when I was</v>

2814
02:20:50.841 --> 02:20:51.674
<v Speaker 3>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2815
02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:55.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is beautiful and interesting and bold</v>

2816
02:20:55.281 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get that without a certain</v>

2817
02:20:57.381 --> 02:20:59.690
<v Speaker 3>amount of ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to mock that ego is like,</v>

2818
02:20:59.691 --> 02:21:00.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2819
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2820
02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:03.040
<v Speaker 3>that's who she was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2821
02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:04.050
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2822
02:21:04.050 --> 02:21:06.290
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm with Tupac is doing this.</v>

2823
02:21:06.430 --> 02:21:10.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's kind of like locked into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics of the 19 nineties.</v>

2824
02:21:10.311 --> 02:21:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

2825
02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:13.220
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're probably the epitome of that,</v>

2847
02:22:04.431 --> 02:22:05.251
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2848
02:22:05.251 --> 02:22:08.780
<v Speaker 3>This is a group that I grew up listening</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all the way back in Lebanon when I</v>

2849
02:22:08.781 --> 02:22:13.781
<v Speaker 3>was a kid and I've made contact with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>representatives of the lead singer and</v>

2850
02:22:15.051 --> 02:22:16.690
<v Speaker 3>he said that he will come on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2851
02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting.</v>

2852
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 3>So all the people that I've had on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

2853
02:22:20.301 --> 02:22:23.300
<v Speaker 3>all of whom had been lovely and</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplished people I think,</v>

2854
02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:26.700
<v Speaker 3>and I hope I'm not being insulting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

2855
02:22:26.701 --> 02:22:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm as excited to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking to anyone which shows,</v>

2856
02:22:29.311 --> 02:22:30.540
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power of music,</v>

2857
02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:33.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As much as I am in speaking to this</v>

2858
02:22:33.241 --> 02:22:34.240
<v Speaker 3>gentleman.</v>

2860
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:43.290
<v Speaker 3>That's actually not the singer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a set of bare chest under a suit coat.</v>

2861
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:47.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy that's rustled Thompkins</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jr.</v>

<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>

2864

<v Speaker 3>very high with his voice.</v>

02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 3>dance and move back then everyone waS</v>
<v Speaker 3>like synchronized and there was like a</v>

2868
02:23:06.601 --> 02:23:09.960
<v Speaker 3>thing they used to do together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that doesn't really happen</v>

2869
02:23:09.961 --> 02:23:11.610
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what happened where people</v>

2870
02:23:11.611 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 3>decided that synchronized singing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>five men together stage.</v>

2871
02:23:14.971 --> 02:23:16.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not cool anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is five men moving their arms and</v>

2875
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:27.540
<v Speaker 3>singing in synchronicity while people</v>
<v Speaker 3>dance slowly,</v>

2876
02:23:27.541 --> 02:23:30.210
<v Speaker 3>which no one does anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one dances like that anymore.</v>

2879
02:23:34.441 --> 02:23:36.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know someone needs to bring back the</v>

2880
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:39.000
<v Speaker 3>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>train it in 2001.</v>

2881
02:23:39.001 --> 02:23:43.230
<v Speaker 3>When we lived in southern California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the crazy idea of calling the</v>

2882
02:23:43.231 --> 02:23:48.231
<v Speaker 3>representatives of the stylistics to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much it would cost to hire them for</v>

2883
02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.220
<v Speaker 3>private concert.</v>

2884
02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:53.550
<v Speaker 3>Somehow I thought that a professor had</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough of a salary.</v>

2885
02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:57.130
<v Speaker 3>The higher the stylistics for a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>concert.</v>

2886
02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:58.940
<v Speaker 3>How many people apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2887
02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I just had this fantasy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2888
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:06.110
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be amazing to invite people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to apparently a much poorer than I think</v>

2889
02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I am?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's five dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually.</v>

2891
02:24:10.290 --> 02:24:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was something in the order.</v>

2892
02:24:12.181 --> 02:24:13.510
<v Speaker 3>this is 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 years ago it was,</v>

2893
02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe half a million dollars.</v>

2894
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:21.110
<v Speaker 3>The cost of flying them in their fee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I went to uc irvine was not paying me</v>

2895
02:24:22.201 --> 02:24:23.850
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact number,</v>

2896
02:24:23.851 --> 02:24:25.500
<v Speaker 3>but it was much more than I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>afford.</v>

2897
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were you hoping for?</v>

2898
02:24:27.061 --> 02:24:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Like 10 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 thouSand,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2900
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.770

<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

2901
02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had joe rogan money,</v>

2902
02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.390
<v Speaker 3>but I only have mere professor money</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's even 50,000.</v>

2903
02:24:43.390 --> 02:24:45.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like I wouldn't spend that much</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2904
02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:47.610
<v Speaker 3>It's christ.</v>

<v Speaker 3>have to give back?</v>

2917

<v Speaker 3>How much the record</v>

2918
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>companies would have to give back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was established and it was</v>

2919
02:25:27.131 --> 02:25:28.540
<v Speaker 2>stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of the.</v>

2920
02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:31.300

<v Speaker 2>Can we do it or would they were they?</v>

<v Speaker 2>to the people listening right now on</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>

2926
02:25:42.291 --> 02:25:45.010
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to hear shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what we'll do.</v>

2927
02:25:45.250 --> 02:25:49.960
<v Speaker 2>We will synchronize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie will tell you what this is and you</v>

2928
02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:52.130
<v Speaker 2>can synchronize it doesn't even work</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2929
02:25:52.131 --> 02:25:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Can you open up to youtube windows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put up the.</v>

2930
02:25:54.131 --> 02:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I can put the video in the corner so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see what we're up a 56 second video</v>

2931
02:25:58.331 --> 02:26:01.130
<v Speaker 2>called led up verse spirit stairway to</v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven comparison.</v>

2932
02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 2>So we'll have to kind of talk a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of it.</v>

2933
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are listening to this</v>

2934
02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.510
<v Speaker 2>live streaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get this,</v>

2935
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:09.610
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to be blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead air.</v>

2936
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:14.910
<v Speaker 2>So this is the originAl song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the led zeppelIn version.</v>

2937
02:26:15.070 --> 02:26:19.400
<v Speaker 2>This is the song that lead's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been fucking ripped off exactly.</v>

2938
02:26:19.490 --> 02:26:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Like dude is 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like 80 percent or 70 percent.</v>

2939
02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:28.870
<v Speaker 2>That's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stole this.</v>

2940
02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>This band opened for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2941
02:26:30.890 --> 02:26:34.000
<v Speaker 2>it's only one of many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of influences that</v>

2942
02:26:34.001 --> 02:26:37.720
<v Speaker 2>they had from old blues songs that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>added to some of their songs,</v>

2943
02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:41.770
<v Speaker 2>which is more forgivable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a kin to what they do today with</v>

2944
02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 2>rap music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sampling,</v>

2945
02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:45.550
<v Speaker 2>which I don't have any problem with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2946
02:26:45.551 --> 02:26:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it kind of enhances it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and makes you think about the old song.</v>

2947
02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 2>But this is agregious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was their position?</v>

2948
02:26:52.841 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It just happened by fluke that we came</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with the same notes,</v>

2949
02:26:55.690 --> 02:26:59.260
<v Speaker 2>just hired the best lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got themselves some jews.</v>

2950
02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that nsma?</v>

2951
02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:04.870
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At being lawyers.</v>

2952
02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:07.870
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you play the okay as both of them.</v>

2953
02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll play the play the second part of</v>

2954
02:27:12.281 --> 02:27:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first one is stairway to heaven.</v>

2955
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a better version of it.</v>

2956
02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the compare it.</v>

2957

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's not it.</v>

2966
02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:42.680
<v Speaker 2>The taurus is the sound you're listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to right now.</v>

2972
02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:02.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a better system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That riff is the part that's in</v>

2973
02:28:02.151 --> 02:28:03.170
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2974
02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was one of the other songs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other songs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2978
02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Not withstanding the potential for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>having done some unsavory things.</v>

2979
02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:13.760
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't.</v>

2991
02:28:51.531 --> 02:28:52.364
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2992
02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pays to be super famous I guess.</v>

2993
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of Janet Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 2>marrying some oil sha?</v>

2994
02:28:58.610 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 2>She's full on burka.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burka,</v>

2995
02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well some of those videos need to be</v>

2996
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:09.020
<v Speaker 2>expunged from our collective memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she pulled the tid out at the</v>

2997
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:12.260
<v Speaker 2>superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jay z and kanye paid $6,000,000 to</v>

2998
02:29:12.261 --> 02:29:17.261
<v Speaker 2>perform in dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

2999
02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:20.450
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a place that you would be</v>

3000
02:29:20.451 --> 02:29:25.451
<v Speaker 2>invited for a very large sum of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would refuse because you</v>

3001
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:30.680
<v Speaker 2>disagree politically or ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>would whatever that person was inviting</v>

3002
02:29:30.681 --> 02:29:33.080
<v Speaker 2>you stands for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3003
02:29:33.081 --> 02:29:34.360
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly they didn't.</v>

3004
02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:37.220
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know they were bought for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some price.</v>

3005
02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit different what they do</v>

3006
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:41.410
<v Speaker 2>because they would go over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3007
02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess they would know like what their</v>
<v Speaker 2>material would be,</v>

3008
02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:47.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they went over there to perform</v>

3009
02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:52.340
<v Speaker 2>99 problems like jay z's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lyrics are out there,</v>

3010
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:53.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say like,</v>

3011
02:29:53.181 --> 02:29:55.190
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would like you going to give you 6</v>

3012
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.880
<v Speaker 2>million bucks.</v>

3013
02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:58.520
<v Speaker 2>We want you to sing 99 problems and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different songs.</v>

3014
02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:00.470
<v Speaker 2>The lyrics are clearly established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3015
02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 2>But if someone like me went over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did comedy,</v>

3016
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:04.460
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3017
02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:06.890
<v Speaker 2>who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it who?</v>

3018
02:30:06.990 --> 02:30:11.370
<v Speaker 2>One of the guests I had in the past?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3019
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:13.820
<v Speaker 2>house parks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was house parks that went</v>

3020
02:30:13.821 --> 02:30:18.821
<v Speaker 2>over to dubai and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had did a bit and he was told by one</v>

3021
02:30:19.581 --> 02:30:23.630
<v Speaker 2>of the people in the audience that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be arrested because he</v>

3022
02:30:23.631 --> 02:30:27.530
<v Speaker 2>referred to one of the royal family by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong name.</v>

3023
02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Call them sir instead of your highness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they were going to arrest him.</v>

3024
02:30:32.511 --> 02:30:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then some other member of the royal</v>

3025
02:30:34.671 --> 02:30:37.430
<v Speaker 2>family stepped in and stopped it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said no,</v>

3026
02:30:37.431 --> 02:30:40.770
<v Speaker 2>he was respectful and he just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the traditional protocol,</v>

3027
02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but they were ready to lock him up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cage because he used the wrong</v>

3028
02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:45.553
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>

3029
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Not even in a disrespectful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3030
02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just called him sir.</v>

3031
02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:52.670
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:30:52.671 --> 02:30:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not the place that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

3033
02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:56.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

3034
02:30:56.421 --> 02:30:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in any place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look man,</v>

3035
02:30:58.641 --> 02:31:00.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem with Canada right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and know.</v>

3036
02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what happened in vancouver.</v>

3037
02:31:02.481 --> 02:31:04.730
<v Speaker 2>We're a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was heckled by these lesbians.</v>

3038
02:31:04.731 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And shit all over them.</v>

3039
02:31:06.261 --> 02:31:11.261
<v Speaker 2>And then they sued him and won because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had done something to violate their</v>

3040
02:31:11.631 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 2>human rights because they were heckling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just him,</v>

3041
02:31:14.061 --> 02:31:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but people before him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were disrupting a live performance.</v>

3042
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:19.160
<v Speaker 2>So do you think</v>

3043
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 4>this trend of famous comics refusing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>perform at universities is only going to</v>

3044
02:31:28.411 --> 02:31:32.190
<v Speaker 4>continue to increase or again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have we reached the maximum and now</v>

3045
02:31:32.191 --> 02:31:34.650
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be blow back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I know jerry seinfeld doesn't do</v>

3046
02:31:34.651 --> 02:31:36.800
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris rock doesn't do it right.</v>

3047
02:31:37.060 --> 02:31:40.780
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done it since 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it was the last time I did a show</v>

3048
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:43.330
<v Speaker 5>it as a cost center set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3049
02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:45.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they have enough life</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

3050
02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:47.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to talk to people that have</v>

3051
02:31:47.771 --> 02:31:48.461
<v Speaker 5>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

3052
02:31:48.461 --> 02:31:52.540
<v Speaker 5>when I talked to people I want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>to someone who has had affairs,</v>

3053
02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:55.030
<v Speaker 5>love affairs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has,</v>

3054
02:31:55.031 --> 02:32:00.031
<v Speaker 5>had jobs and been fired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has had education and as I want someone</v>

3055
02:32:00.251 --> 02:32:03.370
<v Speaker 5>with life experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not there's anything wrong with being 18</v>

3056
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:05.200
<v Speaker 5>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>

3057
02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:08.980
<v Speaker 5>but I want someone who's got some living</v>
<v Speaker 5>under their belt so they know what the</v>

3058
02:32:08.981 --> 02:32:10.220
<v Speaker 5>fuck I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3059
02:32:10.330 --> 02:32:12.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have to explain</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything I don't want.</v>

3060
02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:14.860
<v Speaker 5>I did a concert once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a concert,</v>

3061
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:17.920
<v Speaker 5>but did a show once in the university</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was talking about something sexual</v>

3062
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:20.530
<v Speaker 5>and I saw this bewildered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks in the audience.</v>

3063
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:23.230
<v Speaker 5>How many people are virgins?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3064
02:32:23.231 --> 02:32:25.420
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even raise your hand because I</v>

3065
02:32:25.421 --> 02:32:26.350
<v Speaker 5>don't incriminate you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3066
02:32:26.351 --> 02:32:29.290
<v Speaker 5>just blink real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they started laughing,</v>

3067
02:32:29.291 --> 02:32:31.330
<v Speaker 5>but it got real uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3068
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:32.680
<v Speaker 5>would you again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3069
02:32:32.681 --> 02:32:34.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna even look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3070
02:32:34.271 --> 02:32:37.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to look at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you say that I would be out of</v>

3071
02:32:37.421 --> 02:32:40.940
<v Speaker 5>line if I said 10 percent of you were</v>
<v Speaker 5>virgins and the place went?</v>

3072
02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:41.870
<v Speaker 5>They went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3073
02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:42.840
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

3074
02:32:42.841 --> 02:32:44.860
<v Speaker 5>It's probably about right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People like yelling.</v>

3075
02:32:44.861 --> 02:32:46.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

3076
02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Ten percent of you are virgins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like if there's 200 people,</v>

3077
02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.390
<v Speaker 5>each one of you are fucking virgin is</v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

3078
02:32:52.391 --> 02:32:54.940
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of people and it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than that.</v>

3079
02:32:54.970 --> 02:32:57.250
<v Speaker 5>They're probably being modest or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>being honest about it.</v>

3080
02:32:57.490 --> 02:33:00.100
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not nothing wrong with being</v>

3081
02:33:00.101 --> 02:33:02.710
<v Speaker 5>college obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as far as like where I want to</v>

3082
02:33:02.711 --> 02:33:04.090
<v Speaker 5>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a lot of,</v>

3083
02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I have a day,</v>

3084
02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:07.300
<v Speaker 5>there's 24 hours in that day.</v>

3085
02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:09.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a lot of hours to perform</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night.</v>

3086
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:12.310
<v Speaker 5>If I'm performing at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get a couple of hours.</v>

3087
02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:13.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like,</v>

3088
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:16.780
<v Speaker 5>I like doing actual comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like doing what I do and then one of the</v>

3089
02:33:16.781 --> 02:33:21.730
<v Speaker 5>things about comedy is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's different than any other art form</v>

3090
02:33:21.731 --> 02:33:24.370
<v Speaker 5>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you go to see music,</v>

3091
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:26.260
<v Speaker 5>like you know what you're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

3092
02:33:26.261 --> 02:33:27.630
<v Speaker 5>you don't usually just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3093
02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:28.990
<v Speaker 5>live music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3094
02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.000
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's hope that it's something I'm</v>

3095
02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:32.230
<v Speaker 5>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3096
02:33:32.231 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 5>we're going to see jay z followed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnny Cash followed by loretta lynn.</v>

3097
02:33:36.490 --> 02:33:37.720
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be that way.</v>

3098
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:40.450
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna go to a rock and roll club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go to the viper room,</v>

3099
02:33:40.451 --> 02:33:43.450
<v Speaker 5>most likely gonna hear some rock and</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll and he'd go to a country western</v>

3100
02:33:43.451 --> 02:33:43.961
<v Speaker 5>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3101
02:33:43.961 --> 02:33:44.794
<v Speaker 5>you get to see that.</v>

3102
02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:48.520
<v Speaker 5>I think with standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people get upset if you're not doing</v>

3103
02:33:48.521 --> 02:33:52.000
<v Speaker 5>like what appeals to them and their</v>
<v Speaker 5>sensibility.</v>

3104
02:33:52.001 --> 02:33:55.240
<v Speaker 5>So I like to go to nightclubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I like,</v>

3105
02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:57.130
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even do corporate gigs.</v>

3106
02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I get a lot of offers to do these</v>
<v Speaker 5>corporate gigs and they'll,</v>

3107
02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:02.710
<v Speaker 5>they'll pay you a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There'll be to tame the audience.</v>

3108
02:34:02.711 --> 02:34:04.570
<v Speaker 5>They won't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a,</v>

3109
02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:07.470
<v Speaker 5>it's not a real comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you guys are paying.</v>

3110
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:10.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like your gad sad paying 50 grand</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have these guys singing your</v>

3111
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:12.490
<v Speaker 5>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some weird ego thing,</v>

3112
02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:15.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw my friend dana white,</v>

3113
02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 5>who is the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's head of the ufc.</v>

3114
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:23.220
<v Speaker 5>He had a birthday party years back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stone temple pilots played for that dude</v>

3115
02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:24.850
<v Speaker 5>died of an overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RIght.</v>

3116
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:27.850
<v Speaker 5>And man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody was fucking paying attention.</v>

3117
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:31.540
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stone temple pilots mean they kinda got</v>

3118
02:34:31.541 --> 02:34:32.680
<v Speaker 5>everybody to pay attention.</v>

3119
02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Got everybody moved towards the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people a didn't know to expect stone</v>

3120
02:34:36.851 --> 02:34:41.020
<v Speaker 5>temple pilots who was a big surprise and</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I even introduced them,</v>

3121
02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:43.990
<v Speaker 5>when I introduce stone temple pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people didn't even think that it was</v>

3122
02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:46.810
<v Speaker 5>really going to be stone temple pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3123
02:34:46.811 --> 02:34:49.420
<v Speaker 5>happy birthday to dana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thanked him for everything and then I</v>

3124
02:34:49.421 --> 02:34:51.580
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to blow your mind right</v>

3125
02:34:51.581 --> 02:34:52.540
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3126
02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:55.420
<v Speaker 5>stone temple pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they came out and it was really</v>

3127
02:34:55.421 --> 02:34:57.910
<v Speaker 5>stone temple pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went hard.</v>

3128
02:34:58.120 --> 02:34:59.470
<v Speaker 5>They did there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really,</v>

3129
02:34:59.471 --> 02:35:03.100
<v Speaker 5>really impressive stuff because they did</v>
<v Speaker 5>their full on concert,</v>

3130
02:35:03.310 --> 02:35:06.280
<v Speaker 5>like a 100 percent all out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was intense.</v>

3131
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 5>It was really amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't a lot of people paying</v>

3132
02:35:09.311 --> 02:35:10.780
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And while I was,</v>

3133
02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:12.910
<v Speaker 5>while I was sitting there watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3134
02:35:12.911 --> 02:35:13.541
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3135
02:35:13.541 --> 02:35:15.350
<v Speaker 5>never again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm never doing.</v>

3136
02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'd already decided I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do it.</v>

3137
02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:20.210
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't going to do that anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember</v>

3138
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:23.670
<v Speaker 4>that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in our first chat several years</v>

3139
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:25.680
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has resonated and stuck with me,</v>

3140
02:35:25.681 --> 02:35:30.681
<v Speaker 4>you were comparing your career as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup comic or in fighting to the</v>

3141
02:35:33.271 --> 02:35:37.200
<v Speaker 4>truth that comes in science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're comparing that to acting,</v>

3142
02:35:37.201 --> 02:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>which is very ephemera and fuzzy and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were saying basically,</v>

3143
02:35:40.321 --> 02:35:41.730
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're a scientist,</v>

3144
02:35:41.731 --> 02:35:44.790
<v Speaker 4>you have to present stuff and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>either right or wrong and people are</v>

3145
02:35:44.791 --> 02:35:47.760
<v Speaker 4>going to judge you and you analogized it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to comedy.</v>

3146
02:35:47.761 --> 02:35:51.240
<v Speaker 4>You get up in front of a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you either know you're either funny or</v>

3147
02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:52.980
<v Speaker 4>you're going to bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get up to fight.</v>

3148
02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:55.740
<v Speaker 4>You either are ready or are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get pummeled.</v>

3149
02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:58.890
<v Speaker 4>And I thought that was a really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>analogy because there's truth and</v>

3150
02:35:58.891 --> 02:35:59.940
<v Speaker 4>honesty in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3151
02:35:59.941 --> 02:36:01.860
<v Speaker 4>There is no way to wing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a comic.</v>

3152
02:36:01.861 --> 02:36:04.340
<v Speaker 4>You get up and you better be funny,</v>

3153
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.781
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3154
02:36:04.781 --> 02:36:08.080
<v Speaker 5>but it's very subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one thing to make might make you</v>

3155
02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:10.900
<v Speaker 5>laugh is different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone might think is terrible.</v>

3156
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:14.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>fans of certain comedians that other</v>

3157
02:36:14.621 --> 02:36:17.350
<v Speaker 5>people think or how awful it just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>music,</v>

3158
02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain types of.</v>

3159
02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:20.200
<v Speaker 5>It's all subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3160
02:36:20.210 --> 02:36:25.210
<v Speaker 5>it's like when you consider art,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's really like fighting even it's</v>

3161
02:36:25.301 --> 02:36:30.301
<v Speaker 5>like who's not necessarily even who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily better.</v>

3162
02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:34.000
<v Speaker 5>SometImes it's like what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

3163
02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:38.140
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes dudes collide heads and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes the course of a fight and it's</v>

3164
02:36:38.141 --> 02:36:42.370
<v Speaker 5>not because of skill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because in the moment something</v>

3165
02:36:42.371 --> 02:36:45.970
<v Speaker 5>happened chaotic or someone got poked in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the eye and they couldn't see well,</v>

3166
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:48.820
<v Speaker 5>and then they got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they the worst fighter?</v>

3167
02:36:49.390 --> 02:36:51.880
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like sometimes there's a.</v>

3168
02:36:51.881 --> 02:36:56.230
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of unpredictable</v>
<v Speaker 5>variables that come into place.</v>

3169
02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Here's a guy that I recently discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an italian comedian Who had an hbo</v>

3170
02:37:02.871 --> 02:37:04.430
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

3171
02:37:04.590 --> 02:37:07.050
<v Speaker 5>sebastian sebastian maniscalco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a buddy of mine.</v>

3172
02:37:07.051 --> 02:37:08.620
<v Speaker 5>He's been on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No kidding.</v>

3173
02:37:08.621 --> 02:37:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Hilarious.</v>

3174
02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:10.360
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live it.</v>

3175
02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Usually when I watch standup comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3176
02:37:12.001 --> 02:37:13.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll laugh a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is funny that,</v>

3177
02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 4>but that guy in that</v>

3178
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:17.840
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've probably watched shows on showtime.</v>

3179
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I literally could not stop laughing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because somehow his humor very much</v>

3181
02:37:23.511 --> 02:37:27.580
<v Speaker 2>resonated with some of our sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle eastern italian.</v>

3182
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just get so gravitate towards him</v>

3183
02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:33.800
<v Speaker 2>just this guy's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>

3184
02:37:33.801 --> 02:37:35.630
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3185
02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:38.450
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody hates that guy.</v>

3186
02:37:38.610 --> 02:37:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy is loved in the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

3187
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:42.283
<v Speaker 2>but does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he.</v>

3188
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Has he been known for a long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing it for a long time and</v>

3189
02:37:45.831 --> 02:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>he's an interesting case because when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>first started out he wasn't doing that</v>

3190
02:37:49.161 --> 02:37:49.851
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3191
02:37:49.851 --> 02:37:52.280
<v Speaker 2>he had a really work hard at it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become who he is,</v>

3192
02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but he stuck with it and chipped away at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and got better and better and better.</v>

3193
02:37:56.361 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't see him for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had taken mY hiatus from the</v>

3194
02:38:00.891 --> 02:38:05.891
<v Speaker 2>comedy store and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him on showtime when I wasn't at</v>

3195
02:38:06.831 --> 02:38:07.820
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store anymore.</v>

3196
02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was so fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>

3197
02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I remember tweeting at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I got ahold of him,</v>

3198
02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:13.881
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3199
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:15.620
<v Speaker 2>that was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

3200
02:38:15.621 --> 02:38:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And I had heard that he was doing really</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3201
02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:22.160
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't seen him perform and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably like six years,</v>

3202
02:38:22.161 --> 02:38:24.340
<v Speaker 2>five or six years at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3203
02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:27.470
<v Speaker 2>he just had gotten so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an eighth right.</v>

3204
02:38:27.471 --> 02:38:30.350
<v Speaker 2>You agree that much of our humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3205
02:38:30.351 --> 02:38:32.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that you could teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a workshop.</v>

3206
02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to be funny one.</v>

3207
02:38:33.941 --> 02:38:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

3208
02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:35.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3209
02:38:35.241 --> 02:38:37.070
<v Speaker 2>you either have that delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3210
02:38:37.071 --> 02:38:39.620
<v Speaker 2>how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say you have an ember.</v>

3211
02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:40.633
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

3212
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:42.020
<v Speaker 2>if your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an ember,</v>

3213
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:44.720
<v Speaker 2>you could become really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've met a lot of people that sucked</v>

3214
02:38:44.721 --> 02:38:47.750
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning and they just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

3215
02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:49.670
<v Speaker 2>They because they really worked hard at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3216
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:52.550
<v Speaker 2>And here's the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is like,</v>

3217
02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:55.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this relates to what we've been talking</v>

3218
02:38:55.011 --> 02:38:58.790
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being objective about the actual root</v>

3219
02:38:58.791 --> 02:39:02.510
<v Speaker 2>cause of why people like you or don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you try to figure out what,</v>

3220
02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:06.590
<v Speaker 2>what it is about what you're doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like and correct it.</v>

3221
02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get better,</v>

3222
02:39:07.611 --> 02:39:10.490
<v Speaker 2>improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the onlY way to improve is not blame</v>

3223
02:39:10.491 --> 02:39:11.360
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3224
02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you're a bunch of sTupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people do do that.</v>

3225
02:39:16.161 --> 02:39:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And the people that do make those</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuses and don't instead look</v>

3226
02:39:20.631 --> 02:39:21.940
<v Speaker 2>internally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3227
02:39:21.941 --> 02:39:23.630
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes you can have a bad side</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got to say,</v>

3228
02:39:23.631 --> 02:39:24.464
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what man,</v>

3229
02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I fucked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jusT wasn't tuned in.</v>

3230
02:39:27.411 --> 02:39:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta I gotta readjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

3231
02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I was sick that day and there's</v>

3232
02:39:31.821 --> 02:39:34.790
<v Speaker 2>always reasons necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3233
02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:36.680
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily excuses rather,</v>

3234
02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:40.340
<v Speaker 2>but you got to examine those</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable moments and some people</v>

3235
02:39:40.341 --> 02:39:44.210
<v Speaker 2>excuse themselves by that by saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience sucked or you know,</v>

3236
02:39:44.211 --> 02:39:47.750
<v Speaker 2>these people are assholes or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are stupid.</v>

3237
02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:51.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of excuses that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>make and it's super critical that you</v>

3238
02:39:51.501 --> 02:39:53.710
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look at data,</v>

3239
02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.220
<v Speaker 2>look at the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you juke in terms of actionable</v>

3240
02:39:58.221 --> 02:40:00.290
<v Speaker 2>feedback?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you look for it from other</v>

3241
02:40:00.291 --> 02:40:03.560
<v Speaker 2>professional comics because you trust</v>
<v Speaker 2>their opinions more?</v>

3242
02:40:03.561 --> 02:40:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Or are you looking for the civilians in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience to give you that feedback?</v>

3243
02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:09.680
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one is more actionable from your</v>

3244
02:40:09.681 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>perspective as you're trying to improve</v>
<v Speaker 2>your craft is very problematic to play</v>

3245
02:40:13.981 --> 02:40:16.890
<v Speaker 2>for the comedians because comedians like</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird shit,</v>

3246
02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.970
<v Speaker 2>like we might like something completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>obscure that we don't see common,</v>

3247
02:40:21.330 --> 02:40:24.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an audience might not be laughing</v>

3248
02:40:24.331 --> 02:40:29.331
<v Speaker 2>and you might hear one comment in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back of their own fucking ridiculous and</v>

3249
02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:32.940
<v Speaker 2>the audience doesn't think it's funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a trap that the</v>

3250
02:40:32.941 --> 02:40:37.941
<v Speaker 2>comedians will fall into with a start</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing for their peers specifically.</v>

3251
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:42.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of guys that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to call anybody out,</v>

3252
02:40:42.421 --> 02:40:45.330
<v Speaker 2>but there's people that have ruined</v>
<v Speaker 2>their career because they essentially</v>

3253
02:40:45.331 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>became the comic place to the back of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room and the audience didn't think</v>

3254
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:53.850
<v Speaker 2>they were funny and essentially they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of people who try to be funny</v>

3255
02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.480
<v Speaker 2>and instead exonerating themselves for</v>
<v Speaker 2>many real pressure to be funny because</v>

3256
02:40:59.671 --> 02:41:01.380
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to make comics laugh.</v>

3257
02:41:01.381 --> 02:41:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comic's comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3258
02:41:03.330 --> 02:41:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real comics are comics comp,</v>

3259
02:41:05.231 --> 02:41:10.050
<v Speaker 2>like dave chappelle's a comic's comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he kills the audience too because</v>

3260
02:41:10.051 --> 02:41:13.230
<v Speaker 2>he's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the full package where there's</v>

3261
02:41:13.231 --> 02:41:16.590
<v Speaker 2>a lot of comics that bomb in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience,</v>

3262
02:41:16.591 --> 02:41:20.540
<v Speaker 2>but you'll have 20 guys in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room that think it's cool to chuckle</v>

3263
02:41:20.541 --> 02:41:25.541
<v Speaker 2>at obscure references and very bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 2>words that get used in some sort of</v>

3264
02:41:25.681 --> 02:41:27.630
<v Speaker 2>strange weather would be sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3265
02:41:27.631 --> 02:41:27.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3266
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to follow his references takes you</v>

3267
02:41:30.751 --> 02:41:33.030
<v Speaker 2>like a flow chart of 20 pages long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3268
02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I talked to norm mcdonald about him</v>
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>

3269
02:41:34.641 --> 02:41:35.281
<v Speaker 2>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3270
02:41:35.281 --> 02:41:35.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3271
02:41:35.851 --> 02:41:37.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not really that smart.</v>

3272
02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Has really know those words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a one.</v>

3273
02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

3274
02:41:41.310 --> 02:41:44.040
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just finds out words that people</v>

3275
02:41:44.041 --> 02:41:47.130
<v Speaker 2>don't know and he uses them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people laugh even though they don't know</v>

3276
02:41:47.131 --> 02:41:50.340
<v Speaker 2>what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone played a joke on him once</v>

3277
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.640
<v Speaker 2>where they use some reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use some refereNce on Dennis Miller</v>

3278
02:41:56.221 --> 02:41:57.210
<v Speaker 2>that they made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3279
02:41:57.211 --> 02:42:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it was dom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rera used a reference on Dennis Miller</v>

3280
02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:04.380
<v Speaker 2>that he's fade up and dennis started</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing at it even though it wasn't</v>

3281
02:42:04.381 --> 02:42:06.780
<v Speaker 2>real because it was like something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be like,</v>

3282
02:42:06.781 --> 02:42:11.770
<v Speaker 2>cool to know tom to remember that door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was like his,</v>

3283
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:12.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3284
02:42:12.451 --> 02:42:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I fucked him with his own thing.</v>

3285
02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I tricked him with his own trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3286
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:22.830
<v Speaker 2>he just used a reference that isn't real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just can't,</v>

3287
02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3288
02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:27.450
<v Speaker 2>because people don't like to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3289
02:42:27.451 --> 02:42:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't like to say what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck does that mean?</v>

3290
02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of saying what does that</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

3291
02:42:31.621 --> 02:42:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I look,</v>

3292
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I've had 900 plus podcast with 700</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wave fucking smarter than me.</v>

3293
02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So like I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't knoW what that means.</v>

3294
02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to be mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a weird thing where people</v>

3295
02:42:44.671 --> 02:42:49.410
<v Speaker 2>don't like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they equate not having information with</v>

3296
02:42:49.411 --> 02:42:51.630
<v Speaker 2>somehow and they're being less</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>

3297
02:42:51.690 --> 02:42:53.990
<v Speaker 2>which is a really bizarre thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3298
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:57.420
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if you're talking to someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>about something that you couldn't</v>

3299
02:42:57.421 --> 02:42:59.520
<v Speaker 2>possibly have data on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

3300
02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3301
02:43:01.771 --> 02:43:02.970
<v Speaker 2>A video game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3302
02:43:02.971 --> 02:43:04.560
<v Speaker 2>that you don't play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's it about?</v>

3303
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Like how's it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's okay,</v>

3304
02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:08.430
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as it's something about like</v>

3305
02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:11.740
<v Speaker 2>some sort of cultural reference or</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps a book that maybe you should</v>

3306
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:14.200
<v Speaker 2>have initiatives you to admit that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

3307
02:43:14.290 --> 02:43:15.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3308
02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:18.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to be somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

3309
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you feel diminished by information or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of it.</v>

3310
02:43:20.801 --> 02:43:25.801
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny that you say this because</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my classes students will oftentimes</v>

3311
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:29.400
<v Speaker 2>ask me a question and that has me</v>
<v Speaker 2>stumped and I will usually answer it.</v>

3312
02:43:29.410 --> 02:43:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't know the answer.</v>

3313
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Could you send me an email so I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>look it up?</v>

3314
02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:36.730
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they are really impressed by that.</v>

3315
02:43:36.731 --> 02:43:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Honesty Was impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3316
02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hear you.</v>

3317
02:43:40.391 --> 02:43:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the military I guess.</v>

3318
02:43:42.370 --> 02:43:44.710
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I know something,</v>

3319
02:43:45.130 --> 02:43:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I come out with the bravado of I know my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

3320
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.943
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3321
02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:51.610
<v Speaker 2>So have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the humility to know what you know</v>

3322
02:43:51.611 --> 02:43:53.320
<v Speaker 2>and what you don't know as the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying says,</v>

3323
02:43:53.321 --> 02:43:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have um,</v>

3324
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:56.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3325
02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:59.830
<v Speaker 2>what you would say bravado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pride of hard work.</v>

3326
02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've accumulated a massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of knowledge of from seeking this</v>

3327
02:44:04.721 --> 02:44:07.480
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and studying very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that you should be</v>

3328
02:44:07.481 --> 02:44:10.600
<v Speaker 2>proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that you look at.</v>

3329
02:44:10.601 --> 02:44:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're proud of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not diminishing other people that</v>

3330
02:44:13.571 --> 02:44:15.510
<v Speaker 2>don't have that information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just saying like,</v>

3331
02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:17.860
<v Speaker 2>this is what I know to be true and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fact.</v>

3332
02:44:17.861 --> 02:44:20.410
<v Speaker 2>This is undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a beautiful thing that you</v>

3333
02:44:20.411 --> 02:44:22.720
<v Speaker 2>could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about something that you</v>

3334
02:44:22.721 --> 02:44:23.650
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3335
02:44:23.770 --> 02:44:26.350
<v Speaker 2>That will give the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

3336
02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:30.120
<v Speaker 2>that will give them so much more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of respect for you venture than</v>

3337
02:44:30.490 --> 02:44:34.210
<v Speaker 2>horse shooting around and pretending</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such a weird thing that people</v>

3338
02:44:34.211 --> 02:44:34.750
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3339
02:44:34.750 --> 02:44:36.520
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

3340
02:44:36.970 --> 02:44:41.500
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes they want you to weigh in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>things as a scientist,</v>

3341
02:44:41.501 --> 02:44:44.770
<v Speaker 2>which you don't feel that your area of</v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise would allow you to and they</v>

3342
02:44:44.771 --> 02:44:48.160
<v Speaker 2>get frustrated because then they feel as</v>
<v Speaker 2>though you're equivocating.</v>

3343
02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:49.001
<v Speaker 2>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3344
02:44:49.001 --> 02:44:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not willing to make that</v>

3345
02:44:51.251 --> 02:44:52.960
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that level of certainty,</v>

3346
02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:55.600
<v Speaker 2>but they want it because that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>headline has to say.</v>

3347
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And then they get frustrated that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>tippy toeing,</v>

3348
02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:02.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just being humble about what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>true and what I don't think I'm</v>

3349
02:45:02.470 --> 02:45:04.310
<v Speaker 2>knowledgeable enough to say it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3350
02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I've had people get upset at me about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about a upcoming martial</v>

3351
02:45:09.131 --> 02:45:12.340
<v Speaker 2>arts fights because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give predictions.</v>

3352
02:45:12.341 --> 02:45:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

3353
02:45:13.271 --> 02:45:17.100
<v Speaker 2>very rarely give predictions unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some gross mismatch.</v>

3354
02:45:17.101 --> 02:45:20.380
<v Speaker 2>It really shouldn't be happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place because you really have no</v>

3355
02:45:20.381 --> 02:45:21.450
<v Speaker 2>idea what's going to happen.</v>

3356
02:45:21.470 --> 02:45:24.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a high likelihood that something</v>
<v Speaker 2>might happen.</v>

3357
02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:29.131
<v Speaker 2>If I look at the way one guy moves</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus another guy moves and I go into</v>

3358
02:45:29.531 --> 02:45:34.531
<v Speaker 2>my database of experiences of seeing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of live competition and knowing what</v>

3359
02:45:36.251 --> 02:45:39.130
<v Speaker 2>one person is capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can make.</v>

3360
02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I can make a statement with reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainty,</v>

3361
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:46.780
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if they were injured in</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

3362
02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they come into the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

3363
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're breaking up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their girlfriend.</v>

3364
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they got staph infection</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks before the fight and run ended</v>

3365
02:45:55.061 --> 02:45:57.190
<v Speaker 2>up biotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many variables.</v>

3366
02:45:57.340 --> 02:45:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they might get</v>
<v Speaker 2>headbutted like we've talked about</v>

3367
02:45:59.831 --> 02:46:03.340
<v Speaker 2>earlier or they might have an injury</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the middle of the fight,</v>

3368
02:46:03.341 --> 02:46:05.530
<v Speaker 2>like something goes wrong and their knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows out.</v>

3369
02:46:05.531 --> 02:46:08.470
<v Speaker 2>There's so many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has the thing between the boxer and the</v>

3370
02:46:08.471 --> 02:46:09.630
<v Speaker 2>mma guy happened yet?</v>

3371
02:46:10.510 --> 02:46:11.300
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thIs is.</v>

3372
02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I love when someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3373
02:46:13.821 --> 02:46:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I love that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not.</v>

3374
02:46:15.241 --> 02:46:17.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not criticizing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love when someone is so far</v>

3375
02:46:17.721 --> 02:46:20.330
<v Speaker 2>removed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still aware of something</v>

3376
02:46:20.331 --> 02:46:22.520
<v Speaker 2>that's like a big cultural event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3377
02:46:22.521 --> 02:46:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it takes place August 26th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even I,</v>

3378
02:46:25.941 --> 02:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm an unbelievable novice when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this stuff.</v>

3379
02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I think I could make a prediction here</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of your huge podcast that the</v>

3380
02:46:33.021 --> 02:46:35.060
<v Speaker 2>mma guys going to get trashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

3381
02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that most likely he is</v>

3382
02:46:39.111 --> 02:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>going to lose a boxing match to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxer that has every little.</v>

3383
02:46:43.791 --> 02:46:45.540
<v Speaker 2>What's the point of this fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for,</v>

3384
02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:49.130
<v Speaker 2>for my name thIng,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to see a figure skater</v>

3385
02:46:49.131 --> 02:46:52.440
<v Speaker 2>play hockey against wayne gretzky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3386
02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:57.380
<v Speaker 2>So why would the mma guy put himself up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that potential humiliation,</v>

3387
02:46:57.381 --> 02:47:00.740
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar dollar bills.</v>

3388
02:47:00.741 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Y'all been on your show?</v>

3390
02:47:03.171 --> 02:47:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have had them on back before he</v>

3391
02:47:05.211 --> 02:47:07.310
<v Speaker 2>blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's too big now.</v>

3392
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I refer to him as a conrad last time or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3393
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>all of combat sports.</v>

3399

<v Speaker 2>He became so famous so quick and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

3400
02:47:28.030 --> 02:47:30.450
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real unicorn in a lot of ways.</v>

3401
02:47:30.490 --> 02:47:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Get so many different things going for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

3402
02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Handsome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal knockout artists,</v>

3403
02:47:35.541 --> 02:47:38.780
<v Speaker 2>predicts outcomes and pulls them off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3404
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:41.600
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been incredibly successful in a</v>

3405
02:47:41.601 --> 02:47:42.920
<v Speaker 2>short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

3406
02:47:42.921 --> 02:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>two world titles in two different weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes and is arguably the greatest</v>

3407
02:47:47.601 --> 02:47:50.540
<v Speaker 2>trash talker ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trashed talks better than anybody</v>

3408
02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.020
<v Speaker 2>because that right there is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big thing that's going on today,</v>

3409
02:47:54.021 --> 02:47:54.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3410
02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:56.370
<v Speaker 2>The press conference or actually I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the thing,</v>

3411
02:47:56.371 --> 02:48:00.770
<v Speaker 2>they're scalping tickets outside of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 40 bucks right now to my 40.</v>

3412
02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:01.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was free.</v>

3413
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my nephew is probably all over that</v>

3414
02:48:04.341 --> 02:48:05.090
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3415
02:48:05.090 --> 02:48:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:48:06.250 --> 02:48:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

3417
02:48:08.410 --> 02:48:10.790
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the press conference itself will be</v>

3418
02:48:10.791 --> 02:48:15.620
<v Speaker 2>a show because this guy is so good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting people riled up and talk and</v>

3419
02:48:15.650 --> 02:48:17.330
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's half the fun.</v>

3420
02:48:17.331 --> 02:48:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I was too young to appreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mohammed ali days,</v>

3421
02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that when muhammad</v>
<v Speaker 2>ali was challenging sonny liston,</v>

3422
02:48:25.761 --> 02:48:29.480
<v Speaker 2>like half of the fun was mohammed ali</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and shit.</v>

3423
02:48:29.481 --> 02:48:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's crazy.</v>

3424
02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:36.060
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the mechanism When I take</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some random person online and I just</v>

3425
02:48:36.441 --> 02:48:39.590
<v Speaker 2>have fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people miss understand this to</v>

3426
02:48:39.591 --> 02:48:41.150
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting pissed.</v>

3427
02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing bantering.</v>

3428
02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually doing this with a smile on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face,</v>

3429
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:47.510
<v Speaker 2>but they think of it as though I'm.</v>

3430
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:49.490
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just trash talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3431
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing,</v>

3432
02:48:50.931 --> 02:48:53.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like engaging with people you don't</v>

3433
02:48:53.601 --> 02:48:55.760
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes that person's insane and</v>

3434
02:48:55.761 --> 02:49:00.080
<v Speaker 2>then they'll make it a career to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>after god sat all day long.</v>

3435
02:49:00.081 --> 02:49:04.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interacting with people in text</v>

3436
02:49:04.911 --> 02:49:07.120
<v Speaker 2>form is very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3437
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

3438
02:49:09.111 --> 02:49:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't get social cues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can adjust.</v>

3439
02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:12.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3440
02:49:12.331 --> 02:49:16.260
<v Speaker 2>like in our conversation we're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth and you say</v>

3441
02:49:16.261 --> 02:49:20.520
<v Speaker 2>something and I react to it and we laugh</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we see eaCh other.</v>

3442
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:23.190
<v Speaker 2>all that's missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're writing things,</v>

3443
02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if someone like writes a blog</v>

3444
02:49:26.041 --> 02:49:27.540
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody listens to what you've said</v>

3445
02:49:27.541 --> 02:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>on this podcast and they write a blog</v>
<v Speaker 2>about you defining you,</v>

3446
02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.490
<v Speaker 2>he Is a man that does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole career is this and you read</v>

3447
02:49:35.491 --> 02:49:35.580
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3448
02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Like sam harris was just explaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to me that someone did about</v>

3449
02:49:39.301 --> 02:49:41.160
<v Speaker 2>him and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it and I was like,</v>

3450
02:49:41.161 --> 02:49:44.310
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is such a weird way to describe and</v>

3451
02:49:44.311 --> 02:49:47.760
<v Speaker 2>interact with the person that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never even met credible to write a one</v>

3452
02:49:47.761 --> 02:49:50.160
<v Speaker 2>sided thing where you don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>

3453
02:49:50.370 --> 02:49:52.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really know him.</v>

3454
02:49:52.230 --> 02:49:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3455
02:49:53.250 --> 02:49:54.780
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen some videos,</v>

3456
02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:59.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe the excuse me to interrupt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would muster such animus</v>

3457
02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:01.710
<v Speaker 2>towards a person that you haven't met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3458
02:50:01.711 --> 02:50:02.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3459
02:50:02.071 --> 02:50:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fortunate enough to not have too</v>

3460
02:50:03.721 --> 02:50:07.410
<v Speaker 2>many of these haters and trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is one or two guys that have</v>

3461
02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:11.730
<v Speaker 2>come to my attention that it seems as</v>
<v Speaker 2>though they spend 90 percent of their</v>

3462
02:50:11.731 --> 02:50:14.970
<v Speaker 2>day doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trashed stuff about me and you think,</v>

3463
02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>what could it be that I could so trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>in them that they would construe it as a</v>

3464
02:50:20.821 --> 02:50:24.810
<v Speaker 2>valuable use of their time to take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone whom they've never even met.</v>

3465
02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:29.910
<v Speaker 2>But somehow they're pissed at you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think it's a worthwhile cause to</v>

3466
02:50:30.270 --> 02:50:31.600
<v Speaker 2>trash talk you all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3467
02:50:31.601 --> 02:50:34.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even if they have a valid point,</v>

3468
02:50:34.231 --> 02:50:38.430
<v Speaker 2>there becomes some sort of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic slash parasitic relationship</v>

3469
02:50:38.730 --> 02:50:42.810
<v Speaker 2>with the person that you're criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you are inexorably connected to</v>

3470
02:50:42.811 --> 02:50:44.280
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are your enemy.</v>

3471
02:50:44.281 --> 02:50:48.900
<v Speaker 2>You think about them all the time and by</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue that you become part of them or</v>

3472
02:50:48.901 --> 02:50:52.350
<v Speaker 2>they become part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird thing about thinking,</v>

3473
02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:55.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're on stage and you are</v>

3474
02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:58.080
<v Speaker 2>giving a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the more amazing things that</v>

3475
02:50:58.081 --> 02:51:01.980
<v Speaker 2>happens when someone is on stage talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about something is you allow them to</v>

3476
02:51:01.981 --> 02:51:05.520
<v Speaker 2>kind of think for you in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are,</v>

3477
02:51:05.730 --> 02:51:08.610
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons why it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so important to be articulate and so</v>

3478
02:51:08.611 --> 02:51:13.611
<v Speaker 2>important to be very aware of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say in advance.</v>

3479
02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:17.580
<v Speaker 2>the point where it comes out smoothly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's good entertainment value to</v>

3480
02:51:17.581 --> 02:51:20.500
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's pleasing to listen to it</v>

3481
02:51:20.501 --> 02:51:24.240
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aware of how annoying certain</v>

3482
02:51:24.241 --> 02:51:27.210
<v Speaker 2>speech patterns can be and you avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

3483
02:51:27.390 --> 02:51:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of how compelling are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech patterns can be new.</v>

3484
02:51:30.021 --> 02:51:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Embrace those and so it makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasing for the person to listen to so</v>

3485
02:51:33.181 --> 02:51:37.350
<v Speaker 2>they can just sit back and listen to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about evolutionary psychology.</v>

3486
02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when a person sucks at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like grading.</v>

3487
02:51:41.101 --> 02:51:43.140
<v Speaker 2>It's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets in your head.</v>

3488
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:46.020
<v Speaker 2>You're not connected with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowing them to think about</v>

3489
02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:46.913
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3490
02:51:47.140 --> 02:51:47.800
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3491
02:51:47.800 --> 02:51:51.090
<v Speaker 2>that happens with comedy too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when someone is really good,</v>

3492
02:51:51.091 --> 02:51:54.540
<v Speaker 2>like you see it like a great comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a louis c care,</v>

3493
02:51:54.541 --> 02:51:56.630
<v Speaker 2>someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's on stage and he's,</v>

3494
02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:57.900
<v Speaker 2>he's really in the groove.</v>

3495
02:51:58.050 --> 02:51:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of allowing him to think for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3496
02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:04.230
<v Speaker 2>You're like letting him take the reins</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your imagination and your mind and</v>

3497
02:52:04.231 --> 02:52:06.160
<v Speaker 2>your visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>

3498
02:52:06.161 --> 02:52:08.110
<v Speaker 2>it must be a tough job because I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3499
02:52:08.530 --> 02:52:11.410
<v Speaker 2>what if you just had a fight with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife?</v>

3500
02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I've had that before piss right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in 10 minutes I don't give a shit</v>

3501
02:52:16.151 --> 02:52:18.220
<v Speaker 2>about your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to perform.</v>

3502
02:52:18.221 --> 02:52:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of comedy you have?</v>

3503
02:52:20.711 --> 02:52:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're sam kennison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably better because your ankle</v>

3504
02:52:23.441 --> 02:52:24.710
<v Speaker 2>onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck.</v>

3505
02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Like he would go onstage probably angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pumped.</v>

3506
02:52:28.631 --> 02:52:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really depends on what you're trying</v>

3507
02:52:30.251 --> 02:52:33.780
<v Speaker 2>to do and it also depends on like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight was about whether or not you</v>

3508
02:52:33.781 --> 02:52:38.781
<v Speaker 2>were wrong or she was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be way better off going onstage</v>

3509
02:52:39.310 --> 02:52:42.170
<v Speaker 2>if someone wronged me versus if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

3510
02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Deb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have I wrong.</v>

3511
02:52:43.650 --> 02:52:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3512
02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:47.620
<v Speaker 2>that's intrusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts in your head.</v>

3513
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3514
02:52:48.250 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3515
02:52:49.931 --> 02:52:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Just in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reexamining your own behavior</v>

3516
02:52:52.271 --> 02:52:55.060
<v Speaker 2>patterns and finding fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Numb and just fine.</v>

3517
02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:57.310
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the last thing I ever want to do</v>

3518
02:52:57.311 --> 02:53:00.280
<v Speaker 2>is treat someone wrong and then go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

3519
02:53:00.430 --> 02:53:02.600
<v Speaker 2>But if someone treated me like shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then went on stage,</v>

3520
02:53:03.070 --> 02:53:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I probably feel exonerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3521
02:53:06.001 --> 02:53:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I'd feel like I'd feel I'd probably be</v>
<v Speaker 2>energized,</v>

3522
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3523
02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what,</v>
