40
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

41
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>that's why I hate when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she sends me separate ones.</v>

42
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me find it.</v>

43
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the best underwear I've ever </v>

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you one without any,</v>

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>any preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what.</v>

46
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to buy cheap underwear.</v>

47
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I used to buy underwear and like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

48
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:33.051
<v Speaker 1>Those little plastic packages that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get at like Walmart or something like </v>

49
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just throw it in the cart and keep </v>

50
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.761
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they started sending me these </v>

51
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Mondays I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it just underwear like what's </v>

52
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>this is one big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>P,</v>

54
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the average man doesn't change his </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwear more often than every seven </v>

55
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

56
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Like the average male buys a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwear and keep that rotten but </v>

57
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>filter for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

58
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>And they're not that comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

59
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.600
<v Speaker 1>they also that weird hole in the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one understands that shit was </v>

60
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.801
<v Speaker 1>made during the depression when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand how to really pay out </v>

61
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>of your own music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that whole?</v>

62
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Nobody uses that guy down the hall.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so that your cool all day long.</v>

69
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.860

98
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:00.340

<v Speaker 1>for a business with one to 20 employees.</v>

103
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting to me is that </v>

104
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 1>companies are starting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually 11 to 20 employees a </v>

<v Speaker 1>business with 11 to 20 employees.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what they've,</v>

108
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>what they've done is they've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to make you feel better about your</v>

109
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>provider.</v>

110
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Like for a lot of people sell cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>providers,</v>

111
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>just this big company and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their rules and if you don't,</v>

112
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>if you go over your cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you money,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have to pay some sort of an early </v>

116
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>termination fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tings removed,</v>

117
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No early termination fees,</v>

118
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>no cancellation fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just cancel.</v>

119
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:03.371
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to be a part of them </v>

120
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:03.371
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>

121
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't have contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any of that stuff.</v>

122
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.780
<v Speaker 1>You use what you use and that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for it.</v>

123
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't have like x amount of minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>per month.</v>

124
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It used to be that you would buy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of minutes a month,</v>

125
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>like 100 minutes a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you only use 70 of those minutes,</v>

126
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you never got credited for those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>

127
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So Ting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it first.</v>

128
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>The first way they did it was the credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

129
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>They decided to give people the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and credit their next bill and then</v>

130
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:30.101
<v Speaker 1>they decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we charging them for stuff </v>

131
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:30.101
<v Speaker 1>they're not using anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>

132
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's just set it up so that we charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for what they use and in doing so</v>

133
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you will most certainly save money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most logical and reasonable way</v>

134
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>to provide cell phone service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

135
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why anybody would not want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just do it that way.</v>

136
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 1>The only reason is it benefits the cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone providers to charge you a fixed </v>

137
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

138
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Then when you go over that fixed rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit you with the overage charge and</v>

139
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>if you go under that fixed rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to their benefit.</v>

140
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So 10 cut all that stuff out and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>they provide you with an awesome service</v>

141
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.920
<v Speaker 1>with a great company using the sprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>backbone and they do it completely </v>

142
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>ethically and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like doing business with them.</v>

143
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>They're the official cell phone provider</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this podcast.</v>

144
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>The phone that we use when I coordinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>guests and make calls and stuff,</v>

145
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is all through Tang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Rogan.ting.com,</v>

146
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you will save 25 bucks off of any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their devices and they have all the </v>

147
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>finest android devices in stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the one that I have is the Samsung </v>

148
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Galaxy s five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty awesome and it has a lot</v>

149
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>of features that like even with the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphones that are coming out,</v>

150
00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have like it's water </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant,</v>

151
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>which I don't understand why these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are making electronic devices </v>

152
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>that aren't water resistant.</v>

153
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 1>When they can make ones that are water </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant.</v>

154
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It just seems logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Rogan.ting.com,</v>

155
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you can find all the various devices and</v>

<v Speaker 1>One of those people that realize is </v>

<v Speaker 1>most of the time you don't really need </v>

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll take these offices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not wearing them.</v>

175
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Good to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Good to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to see you.</v>

178
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Returning from floating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your tweet</v>

179
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 3>showed a picture of a look like someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in space.</v>

180
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 3>That's how it felt to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to thank you for this because</v>

181
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 3>you are the guy who turned me onto </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating.</v>

182
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 3>I never did it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spoke to me about it last year.</v>

183
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I was so harassed and so rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got.</v>

184
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 3>I never got a chance to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'd do it when I got back to </v>

185
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 3>England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen,</v>

186
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.710
<v Speaker 3>so I got in touch with your friend crash</v>
<v Speaker 3>few weeks before I came out here and he </v>

187
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:24.171
<v Speaker 3>very kindly fitted me in and I think his</v>
<v Speaker 3>place is called float lab technologies </v>

188
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 3>and they're in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there in Venice beach,</v>

189
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.790
<v Speaker 3>so it's a totally new experience for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what made the experience even more </v>

190
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.511
<v Speaker 3>surreal and special because I had asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>for an appointment fairly late in the </v>

191
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:35.511
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

192
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he needed more notice.</v>

193
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 3>He's constantly booked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he could give me was the two rooms,</v>

194
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:47.301
<v Speaker 3>one for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one for my wife Santha at midnight at </v>

195
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 3>midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two nights in a row,</v>

196
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 3>and actually there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating at midnight,</v>

197
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really special.</v>

198
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't do any floating during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

199
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good time.</v>

200
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:03.261
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we went along to Venice beach and </v>

201
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.440
<v Speaker 3>park the car and crash came out and took</v>
<v Speaker 3>us in.</v>

202
00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:10.441
<v Speaker 3>And first of all he showed us his </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection of African masks and he has </v>

203
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:14.781
<v Speaker 3>got the most amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly fearsome collection of African </v>

204
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 3>masks up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really incredible.</v>

205
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Actually it is a deep guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

206
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a trip thinking about a lot of,</v>

207
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been,</v>

208
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I've spent a lot of time in Africa.</v>

209
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a collection like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just just amazing dog on,</v>

210
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:31.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the really fascinating peoples </v>

211
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:31.161
<v Speaker 3>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their mass.</v>

212
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Then he takes us down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks us through what it is.</v>

213
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.100
<v Speaker 3>you go into this room and in it I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen in some places they have like a pod</v>

215
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:43.090
<v Speaker 3>where you close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you close a lit of.</v>

216
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a bigger room than that.</v>

217
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 3>And there's a big full size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feels like a huge metal safe.</v>

218
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have trust issues,</v>

219
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit,</v>

220
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:57.591
<v Speaker 3>you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to close yourself up in a </v>

221
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:57.591
<v Speaker 3>huge metal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe in the darkness.</v>

222
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 3>It takes a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.380
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of courage is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say is required to do that at </v>

224
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.470
<v Speaker 3>midnight on Venice beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we did it.</v>

225
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

226
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 3>we got in there at certain warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get the salty water in</v>

227
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 3>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

228
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:15.801
<v Speaker 3>it's a big distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get it in your ears </v>

229
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 3>because it's got a block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you wear ear plugs.</v>

230
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just go in with my ears.</v>

231
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would prefer to because because the </v>

232
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 3>feeling of being completely deaf was </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly slightly alarming for me.</v>

233
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Although I realize a sensory deprivation</v>
<v Speaker 3>is part of the deal.</v>

234
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

235
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you close the door,</v>

236
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:37.431
<v Speaker 3>there's a towel hanging off the back of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door in case you do get salty water </v>

237
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 3>in your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you just lie down in this,</v>

238
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess body temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say line solution in which it's in,</v>

239
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 3>which is impossible to sink and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in the darkness completely </v>

240
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without sensation,</v>

241
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>totally by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time in</v>

242
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.100
<v Speaker 3>a way ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what sometimes we're </v>

243
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.281
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to be completely alone in total </v>

244
00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:05.911
<v Speaker 3>darkness suspended in that amniotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluid,</v>

245
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:11.341
<v Speaker 3>that strange say line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say line solution with no sensations </v>

246
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 3>coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sounds,</v>

247
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.430
<v Speaker 3>no light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an extraordinary opportunity to </v>

248
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.430
<v Speaker 3>meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reflect,</v>

249
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Speaker 3>to just drift away into another place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not theirs.</v>

250
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.490
<v Speaker 3>The only danger I would say it happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

251
00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:31.491
<v Speaker 3>I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it difficult to shut down my </v>

252
00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mind is always running and,</v>

253
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.440
<v Speaker 3>and a few times it when I was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to let everything go everyday </v>

254
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 3>concerns and worries came back in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>started and started annoying me.</v>

255
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 3>But most of the time I was able to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and it felt like I was.</v>

256
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I was weightless and I was floating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>floating in space.</v>

257
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:53.641
<v Speaker 3>That's why I posted that picture on </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook today because that's what it </v>

258
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:53.641
<v Speaker 3>felt like.</v>

259
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes I didn't know whether I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was horizontal or vertical.</v>

260
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I felt sometimes like I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>vertically floating vertically.</v>

261
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a very odd sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

262
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that I got into deeply </v>
<v Speaker 3>trippy space,</v>

263
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 3>but I did have fundamental visions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patterns.</v>

264
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Lights started to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started to generate purple.</v>

265
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Purple Strips of light started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appear,</v>

266
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 3>which certainly would not there in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the darkness with me.</v>

267
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was interesting.</v>

268
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:26.671
<v Speaker 3>But most of all was just very relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just very relaxing to let go,</v>

269
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:33.050
<v Speaker 3>be completely supported by this soft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentle water drift,</v>

270
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 3>drift away into the realms of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

271
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it was a wonderful experience and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better about it the second day.</v>

272
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Then I did the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first day was some unfamiliarity.</v>

273
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.951
<v Speaker 3>The second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second night last night was just </v>

274
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:46.951
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

275
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's all about.</v>

276
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all about getting used to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

277
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And the more you get used to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

278
00:13:49.761 --> 00:13:52.460
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is to slip into the deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deeper states.</v>

279
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first time.</v>

280
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:59.591
<v Speaker 1>It's very alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so odd and is also kind of bump </v>

281
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:00.290
<v Speaker 1>against the sides and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashes.</v>

282
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:02.570
<v Speaker 1>African mosques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

283
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.710
<v Speaker 1>You probably shouldn't show you those </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you go into total darkness in a </v>

284
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.820
<v Speaker 1>meat locker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

285
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you.</v>

286
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

287
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.290
<v Speaker 1>The second day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second day so much better and so </v>

288
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.870
<v Speaker 1>much so it's made me think maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should get myself a flute thing.</v>

289
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely should.</v>

290
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having one.</v>

291
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I love knowing that anytime I want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there I could just go in there how </v>

292
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 1>they loads and loads of money or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they okay?</v>

293
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are loads and loads of money.</v>

294
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially the flash ones.</v>

295
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.430
<v Speaker 1>The crash ones rather the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original one that I got which was a </v>

296
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Samadhi tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was like six or $7,000,</v>

297
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but crashes are more like 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

298
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Because his car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like buying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like buying a car and it's also,</v>

300
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.170
<v Speaker 1>it has these incredible filters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's set up through like he has it set </v>

301
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>up like the one that I have in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one that goes in it,</v>

302
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a commercial grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtration system,</v>

303
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.250
<v Speaker 1>like he filters things through ozone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these different various </v>

304
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>steps that it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's written like an entire,</v>

305
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.060
<v Speaker 1>like multi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many pages.</v>

306
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 50 or 60 page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A booklet on the necessity for different</v>

307
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:17.550
<v Speaker 1>types of filtration and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

308
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's an obsessive guy and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with tanks has made.</v>

309
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy in Austin that has some </v>

310
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>really amazing tanks to that does it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit differently.</v>

311
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:33.281
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does it through a company that makes </v>

312
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:38.261
<v Speaker 1>boats and his are really excellent too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crash is like the leader of the </v>

313
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the master of the game.</v>

314
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.840
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing like his stuff when </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff came out.</v>

315
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Now there's guys like the guy in Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

316
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.600
<v Speaker 1>in Austin rather that is elevating his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

317
00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I spent some time there and checked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>his facility.</v>

318
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's friends with my friend Aubrey.</v>

319
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

320
00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.280
<v Speaker 1>what crash did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no innovation going on in the </v>

321
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>United States when it came to float </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

322
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 1>There was like the standard somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>tank,</v>

323
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 1>which is really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

324
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:10.391
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely get a cool </v>

325
00:16:10.391 --> 00:16:10.391
<v Speaker 1>experience in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some,</v>

326
00:16:10.391 --> 00:16:10.391
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:16:10.391 --> 00:16:13.991
<v Speaker 1>home models that a few people had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he did is he just took </v>

328
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 1>everything to the next level and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

329
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:18.920
<v Speaker 1>these steel modular boxes that it fits </v>
<v Speaker 1>together perfectly.</v>

330
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 1>More sound deadening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more insulation,</v>

331
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.520
<v Speaker 1>better filtration system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger reinforced sides because if </v>

332
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:32.951
<v Speaker 1>somebody wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would kind of go out on the sides a </v>

333
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.991
<v Speaker 1>little bit from the water and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would rot and like you had to get </v>

334
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 1>things replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fixed everything he fixed.</v>

335
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:41.651
<v Speaker 1>There was an issue with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the linings would burn out sometimes </v>

336
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:46.061
<v Speaker 1>because of the heat pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pads with short out it would burn </v>

337
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:47.480
<v Speaker 1>through the linings and then would leak </v>
<v Speaker 1>water everywhere.</v>

338
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 1>He fixed that by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

339
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 1>by setting like this redundant system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having to heat pads too,</v>

340
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>so if one burns out you have a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>one ready to go.</v>

341
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And then secondly he put these thick </v>
<v Speaker 1>pond filters.</v>

342
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't use like the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>filters that a lot of people do.</v>

343
00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Not filters rather liners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His liners are very thick.</v>

344
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.850
<v Speaker 1>They're for like Koi ponds.</v>

345
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.250
<v Speaker 1>So he's done a lot of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really figured out a lot of </v>

346
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.371
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place to go if you're lucky </v>

347
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:15.371
<v Speaker 1>enough to live in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also if you're lucky enough to</v>

348
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>be able to get in now because now he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>booked way in advance.</v>

349
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what I found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I read it to him.</v>

350
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:24.881
<v Speaker 1>I wrote to him at least four weeks ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were just no slots available </v>

351
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

352
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that's why he gave me the two midnight </v>
<v Speaker 1>slot.</v>

353
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So that actually I'm really glad he gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the midnight slot.</v>

354
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to do it late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way to dentist.</v>

355
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's opening a new unit in Westwood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

356
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Where there'll be seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

358
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Even seven's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's not.</v>

359
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could open up one somewhere that has</v>

360
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>50 and that soccer would be filled all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

361
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It will be 20 million people in la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's not so many other doing this </v>

362
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 1>in La right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few,</v>

363
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

364
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I think people are starting to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of it now and it's growing.</v>

365
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll amazing experience what one </v>

366
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.971
<v Speaker 1>question I have and wonder about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about if you have a joint before </v>

367
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you get in or take some psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that do?</v>

368
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's like to not do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that before you go in and do that.</v>

369
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Every soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not suicide been,</v>

370
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 1>but I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the um,</v>

371
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:22.150
<v Speaker 1>the pot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edibles are the way to go for about </v>

372
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 1>an hour before a terrifying supply of </v>
<v Speaker 1>edibles.</v>

373
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally.</v>

374
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get in there.</v>

375
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

376
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:36.531
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'd like to do as well if I </v>

377
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:36.531
<v Speaker 1>hadn't given up many years ago.</v>

378
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:41.020
<v Speaker 1>It makes me very humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about getting in </v>

379
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.020
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a.</v>

380
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>and because I've done it so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

381
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 1>because I have the tank in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super comfortable,</v>

382
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get relaxed with floating.</v>

383
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a normal thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're on the edibles to,</v>

384
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 1>it just takes you to these really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

385
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No moments of paranoia or fear,</v>

386
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you're just calm there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that I'm,</v>

387
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good with that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I had real problems with </v>

388
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>paranoia and fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to do everything I do</v>

389
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

390
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I do this live,</v>

391
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I do when I do commentary for</v>

392
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>the UFC that's live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very Edgy.</v>

393
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things are all live and </v>

394
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 1>they're all depend on maintaining your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanity under sometimes pretty intense </v>

395
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

396
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

397
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have those,</v>

398
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 1>those paranoia or fear issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I certainly feel the,</v>

399
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

400
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't indulge them and I feel the</v>

401
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:48.321
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a lot of ways not indulge </v>

402
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:48.321
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

404
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of controlling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>

405
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I kind of equate it to just the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to communicate on the Internet and the </v>

406
00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:01.431
<v Speaker 1>ability to access information on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet is led us to this weird place </v>

407
00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>where if you want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your day could be filled with horror.</v>

408
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.230
<v Speaker 1>You could just go everyday to the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible websites and see the most </v>

409
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:14.181
<v Speaker 1>horrific videos and the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs and see the world in the </v>

410
00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:18.141
<v Speaker 1>worst possible light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you chose to just immerse yourself.</v>

411
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watch the news.</v>

412
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even worse the news.</v>

413
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really wanted to really change </v>

414
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.890
<v Speaker 1>the way you saw the world when you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>live on a beautiful treeline street with</v>

415
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:30.830
<v Speaker 1>the nicest neighbors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

416
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the cutest little dogs bark in and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>life looks beautiful,</v>

417
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but through the portal that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

418
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you can immerse yourself in twisted </v>
<v Speaker 1>sadistic minds and,</v>

419
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you have this decision to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not do that.</v>

420
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

421
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sort of reinforcing that decision and</v>

422
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 1>in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>making those choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You build up your resistance to doing </v>

424
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.591
<v Speaker 1>things that are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build up your resistance to </v>

425
00:21:01.591 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 1>indulging in negative thoughts and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense I think it's good,</v>

426
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.400
<v Speaker 1>like one of the weirdest things is have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen someone who's never been </v>

427
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>in any sort of a conflict type </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

428
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 1>but they get thrown into one and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a panic attack and they </v>

429
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 1>hyperventilate and they don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

430
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen many times and then </v>

431
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.431
<v Speaker 1>I've seen other people that are in panic</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations or or rather high stress </v>

432
00:21:23.431 --> 00:21:27.301
<v Speaker 1>situations a lot and they know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay calm and keep cool and I think </v>

433
00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>sometimes your life can depend on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

434
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a killer scuba diving,</v>

435
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 1>which I did a lot of panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panic will kill you.</v>

436
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of scuba diving.</v>

437
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:41.191
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that being a 100 </v>

438
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:42.950
<v Speaker 1>feet down in the ocean where the winds </v>
<v Speaker 1>are moving occurrence.</v>

439
00:21:42.951 --> 00:21:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banging you against rocks and stuff.</v>

440
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.920
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be your lays it down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you really gone.</v>

441
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole nother world.</v>

443
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I did some snorkeling recently with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>

444
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I was in Hawaii and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did it with my four year old </v>

445
00:21:59.380 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

446
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I took her with me into the water and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:06.751
<v Speaker 1>she had the mask on and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like looking down and seeing the </v>

448
00:22:06.751 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>dolphins swimming under us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing,</v>

449
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>really incredibly rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they come and scan,</v>

450
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

451
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they just swam underneath us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they really didn't give a shit about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really kind of one of those weird </v>

453
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 1>looking things up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

454
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a,</v>

455
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.050
<v Speaker 1>it's an eyeopener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how little of a shit dolphins care.</v>

456
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're not trying to capture </v>

457
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:31.740
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more people,</v>

458
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoid the boat,</v>

459
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came near the boat.</v>

460
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been around them though when </v>

461
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.511
<v Speaker 1>they're very playful too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're fishing once and they were </v>

462
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:43.240
<v Speaker 1>jumping by the boat and being really </v>
<v Speaker 1>playful with us.</v>

463
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.130
<v Speaker 1>This was a totally different experience.</v>

464
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just pretty much indifferent but so</v>

465
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just being around them,</v>

466
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.500
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of dolphins and you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at him swimming underneath you.</v>

467
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine that panic in that world</v>

468
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>when something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>adapt than an occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you panic,</v>

470
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you literally are dad because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to stay steady and that's,</v>

471
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the power of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

472
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It's mind over matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

473
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to impose your mind on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>

474
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.620
<v Speaker 1>on that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't know why actually if we </v>

475
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.401
<v Speaker 1>have all this evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we Pattanaik I would've thought </v>

476
00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>billions of years of evolution would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have got rid of that terrible dangerous </v>

477
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.700
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it's there though.</v>

478
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sharpens your,</v>

479
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 1>your reflexes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things about fighters is</v>

480
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:40.351
<v Speaker 1>that a fighter going into a fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not being nervous can be incredibly </v>

481
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:40.351
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

482
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:44.640
<v Speaker 1>and when I was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were moments that I was too </v>

483
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 1>confident and I went in and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

484
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

485
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also couldn't snap myself out of </v>

486
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.681
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a level that you achieve </v>

487
00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 4>when you're really nervous and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not sure of what the outcome is going to</v>

488
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.000
<v Speaker 4>be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like our,</v>

489
00:23:55.001 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 4>a level of reaction and of intensity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you achieve when you go into the,</v>

490
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 4>into a competition where you're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you perform so much better.</v>

491
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.600
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

492
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.010
<v Speaker 4>And then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're super confident,</v>

493
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 4>you feel there's something that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're not nervous at all,</v>

494
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 4>you can't get up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing that happens.</v>

495
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 4>So that adrenaline is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a necessary component.</v>

496
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:22.330
<v Speaker 4>It gives you that extra charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just about managing that and </v>

497
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.290
<v Speaker 4>managing very difficult was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched a told you a few months ago,</v>

498
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:29.291
<v Speaker 4>I watched this Hixon Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie choke choke and that's one of </v>

499
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 4>the things that he said quite early on </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the movie.</v>

500
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

501
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.230
<v Speaker 4>he's always afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't say I'm a field person that </v>

502
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

503
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm always afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

504
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

505
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:43.430
<v Speaker 4>it's managing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's managing that.</v>

506
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 4>What a formidable fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>

507
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.520
<v Speaker 4>he's an amazing guy to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

508
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 4>we had on the podcast recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and my friend Eddie Bravo together.</v>

509
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.750
<v Speaker 4>It was just a huge treat for me as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>

510
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 4>lifelong martial arts practitioner and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fan because he's a real master.</v>

511
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating.</v>

512
00:25:02.261 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 4>The guy that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recommend that to everybody.</v>

513
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Even people that don't do martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>like yourself.</v>

514
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:08.990
<v Speaker 4>You wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you hear about it?</v>

515
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

516
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:13.700
<v Speaker 4>my son in law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jason Sarris does mixed martial arts.</v>

517
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.360
<v Speaker 4>He does particularly Brazilian Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a place called Ama clinic in London </v>

518
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 4>and he does it three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four times a week.</v>

519
00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 4>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

520
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 4>very devoted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

521
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 4>he's been talking me through a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these issues over the last year and,</v>

522
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

523
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

524
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get why he loves it and I think it's </v>

525
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.171
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's been a really great thing </v>

526
00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:38.490
<v Speaker 4>for him and I think it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really great thing for him to be.</v>

527
00:25:38.491 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 4>There was a time in my life when I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>do a martial art.</v>

528
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.490
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I quito.</v>

529
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to Brown belt,</v>

530
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my very early twenties and then I </v>

531
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.220
<v Speaker 4>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not quite sure why I traveled.</v>

532
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 4>I went away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost the practice,</v>

533
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:55.390
<v Speaker 4>and then in my forties I went back to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I worked my way back up to,</v>

534
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 4>to greenbelt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I.</v>

535
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Quito is a different thing from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from this,</v>

536
00:25:59.971 --> 00:26:01.620
<v Speaker 4>this real grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

537
00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:04.690
<v Speaker 4>this Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I see is to,</v>

538
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 4>to people who are into locked and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sent the sensing each other,</v>

539
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.610
<v Speaker 4>each other's movements all the time is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can't,</v>

540
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't predict what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>next in any,</v>

541
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 4>in any way.</v>

542
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.640
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I understand that it's a kind of </v>

543
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 4>meditative thing also that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if,</v>

544
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.390
<v Speaker 4>if you actually start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine because I don't do it,</v>

545
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 4>but this is what my son had low tells </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

546
00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:30.281
<v Speaker 4>If you start thinking while you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in that grapple with that other </v>

547
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 4>very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous person,</v>

548
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to not,</v>

549
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.920
<v Speaker 4>you have to not be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be acting somehow on muscle </v>

550
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:38.920
<v Speaker 4>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

551
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:38.920
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

552
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 4>on instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on experience.</v>

553
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 4>You're not really thinking through your </v>
<v Speaker 4>next move or are you,</v>

554
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you're thinking,</v>

555
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

556
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you are reacting on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

557
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what you try to do is achieve sort of</v>

558
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>a zen state of flow state and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at your best,</v>

559
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:57.951
<v Speaker 1>you're in that flow state where </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you'll be in a position where </v>

560
00:26:57.951 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't even realize how you achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>the position.</v>

561
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just instinctively did it.</v>

562
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's instinctive based on thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of repetitions,</v>

563
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many hours of mat time.</v>

564
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Time's very important.</v>

565
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Matt time being the actual sparring </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself because the rolling,</v>

566
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring,</v>

567
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you understand like the language of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human interaction.</v>

568
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an interaction between a person </v>

569
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 1>attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person defending and there's just like</v>

570
00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>this thing that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of figure out,</v>

571
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that in daily life,</v>

572
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.570
<v Speaker 1>in a modern technological society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people have no experience.</v>

573
00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:39.571
<v Speaker 1>So the tool and they never in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fight situation,</v>

574
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>never ever having to having to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

575
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So if they suddenly find themselves in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation of danger attacked on the </v>

576
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.561
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have the faintest </v>

577
00:27:51.561 --> 00:27:51.561
<v Speaker 1>idea what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

578
00:27:51.561 --> 00:27:52.220
<v Speaker 1>well hopefully that never comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

579
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 1>But the benefits extend outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

580
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the benefits are it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

581
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it prepares you for like the drama of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular life pales in comparison to the </v>

582
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.050
<v Speaker 1>real drama of training and have of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing inside the gymnasium.</v>

583
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Because essentially every time someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>does Jujitsu,</v>

584
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 1>they're competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you spar,</v>

585
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 1>even if you spar with a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

586
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>he's still competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

587
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you get used to this struggle and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that most people don't.</v>

588
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.310
<v Speaker 1>They don't have in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

589
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 1>in having that struggle and in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

590
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.600
<v Speaker 1>it makes the regular stress that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through the stress of bills and have </v>

591
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.060
<v Speaker 1>relationships and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

592
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:49.370
<v Speaker 1>it alleviates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigates a lot of the issues that </v>

593
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 1>people have because the life or death </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

594
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.570
<v Speaker 1>If someone trying to choke you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>battling it out and you're tired,</v>

595
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:59.571
<v Speaker 1>you're exhausted and you've tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain calm and catch your breath and </v>

596
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.781
<v Speaker 1>defend and trying to stay cool and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what's the proper </v>

597
00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:07.341
<v Speaker 1>defense for this situation and how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn this around and how to get back to </v>

598
00:29:07.341 --> 00:29:07.390
<v Speaker 1>a better spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

599
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so harrowing and it's so.</v>

600
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It's so stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a good way.</v>

601
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So you're totally in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

602
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

603
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:21.471
<v Speaker 1>In the moment you're thinking about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other shit girl you dated when </v>

604
00:29:21.471 --> 00:29:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you're in high school where she now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking about that,</v>

605
00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bills you've got to pay or no,</v>

606
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking about any of those </v>

607
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:28.840
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that sense it is very meditative.</v>

608
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It alleviates a lot of the stress of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

609
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.240
<v Speaker 1>And then when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of,</v>

610
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you feel very relaxed because you spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this excess energy that I believe </v>

611
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:38.430
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

612
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a scientific way of looking </v>

613
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.801
<v Speaker 1>at the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think of the human body and a lot </v>

614
00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:47.971
<v Speaker 1>of ways as sort of like a battery and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people's batteries are </v>

615
00:29:47.971 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>overflowing with Jews because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>use them.</v>

616
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You sit down and sedentary state in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a computer all day,</v>

617
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:57.631
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty bad for your back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stare at a screen and you do your </v>

618
00:29:57.631 --> 00:30:01.801
<v Speaker 1>work and then you sit in your car or on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the train or whatever to get home and </v>

619
00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>then you sit in front of the television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

620
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

621
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 1>That's not normal for a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body is supposed to be moving while </v>

622
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>you're young and alive and why you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

623
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body wants to be involved in </v>

624
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.471
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body wants to go hiking and do </v>

625
00:30:19.471 --> 00:30:21.631
<v Speaker 1>things and if he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it atrophies and shrivels up and it </v>

626
00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 1>stops being functional and when you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get all that energy out,</v>

627
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a training session.</v>

628
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It does a couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

629
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:33.601
<v Speaker 1>it strengthens your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you ever do have to use it for </v>

630
00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:36.451
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just something as simple as like </v>

631
00:30:36.451 --> 00:30:38.730
<v Speaker 1>picking things up or just strength to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help move something you have that,</v>

632
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 1>but to you you alleviate all the excess </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

633
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.780
<v Speaker 1>you drain the battery a bit and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>draining the battery you put more juice </v>

634
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.681
<v Speaker 1>in the battery for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the battery has like a higher </v>

635
00:30:52.681 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 1>threshold and then you also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can deal with stuff easier.</v>

636
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Like when I don't train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't exercise,</v>

637
00:30:57.371 --> 00:31:00.200
<v Speaker 1>if I don't do some sort of rigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous physical exercise,</v>

638
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 1>like at least a few days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will react differently to stress.</v>

639
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start getting snappish and.</v>

640
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I get more irritated than I should.</v>

641
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I affects me more than it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

642
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 1>when I train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I train a lot,</v>

643
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 1>it's everything is pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

645
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this effect on my son in law </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a couple of years now of doing this.</v>

646
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 3>He's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really transformed him.</v>

647
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really great thing and they will benefit</v>

648
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:24.400
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

649
00:31:24.401 --> 00:31:26.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm 64 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

650
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can go and do that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

651
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you found another 64 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old.</v>

652
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

653
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Or I could work with one with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal,</v>

654
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 3>one personal teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

655
00:31:36.221 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

656
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to who would understand my level.</v>

657
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.010
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see huge advantages in doing it.</v>

658
00:31:42.011 --> 00:31:47.011
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got more and more interested in it </v>

659
00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:47.011
<v Speaker 3>over the last couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating thing.</v>

660
00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 3>And also tell me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

661
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 3>in a way you're being a warrior in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>

662
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.190
<v Speaker 3>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a warrior thing.</v>

663
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a contentious issue.</v>

664
00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 3>The human race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been around it anatomically modern</v>

665
00:32:00.491 --> 00:32:05.491
<v Speaker 3>form for the last 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years for a lot of time.</v>

666
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Our young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

667
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:13.950
<v Speaker 3>in many societies have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been called to warfare in one form </v>

668
00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:19.471
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that it's gone on long </v>

669
00:32:19.471 --> 00:32:22.291
<v Speaker 3>enough for it to be a fundamental part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the human experience actually,</v>

670
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our society today,</v>

671
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot has a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has worked to move that aside and </v>

672
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 3>probably that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very good thing.</v>

673
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Although we still do have war of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's done at a distance.</v>

674
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Largely it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

675
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing novels about the Spanish </v>

676
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 3>conquest of Mexico at the moment I am </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with,</v>

677
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting inside the heads of warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those guys are on the battlefield </v>

678
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.150
<v Speaker 3>hand to hand with edged weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of experience of battle and </v>

679
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 3>warfare doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think much in modern warfare today.</v>

680
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:00.430
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 3>it's more that guy remotely part think </v>
<v Speaker 3>piloting a drone and shooting people,</v>

682
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 3>shooting people from it from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there is.</v>

683
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there is a warrior need in us </v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

684
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.940
<v Speaker 3>which can be met in a harmless and </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive way on the mat in something </v>

685
00:33:17.231 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 3>like mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm coming to.</v>

686
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Which you agree with.</v>

687
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to that.</v>

688
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very possible that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to the idea that we have </v>

689
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in us a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences based on the genetics of all</v>

690
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:36.491
<v Speaker 1>the people that have lived before us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever fight or flight is inside </v>

691
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever mean throughout history like w.</v>

692
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I've been discussing this with friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>like how fascinating this time is </v>

693
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:46.940
<v Speaker 1>because throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>

694
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.180
<v Speaker 1>if a boat of stranger showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very dangerous.</v>

695
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A boat showed up and you're like,</v>

696
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>

697
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of men climb off the boat.</v>

698
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>You gotta hide women and children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now when a boat shows up,</v>

699
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 1>it's tourism and everybody gets excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

700
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need their money.</v>

701
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to this island.</v>

702
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Come to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring your family.</v>

703
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in.</v>

704
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

705
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:16.630
<v Speaker 1>those experiences that led us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that led the human race in 2014.</v>

706
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 1>These experiences of people pirates </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing up and Viking showing up and all</v>

707
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>those dangerous people showing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different places.</v>

708
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people coming over the hill on armies </v>

709
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just a part of being a human </v>

710
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>being for the longest time for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

711
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this new thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on about the,</v>

712
00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:38.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the autopsy of a witch King of England </v>

713
00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:39.450
<v Speaker 1>second or we should the third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.830
<v Speaker 1>They found his bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really amazing,</v>

715
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:47.831
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found his bones like they found it </v>

716
00:34:47.831 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>under a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a parking lot or parking lot.</v>

717
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

718
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

719
00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It's him.</v>

720
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a long tradition regarding him </v>

721
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.190
<v Speaker 3>and the battle that he was killed in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a famous,</v>

722
00:34:59.191 --> 00:35:02.790
<v Speaker 3>these even a shakespeare play where he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the battle saying famously</v>

723
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:03.870
<v Speaker 3>my horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my horse,</v>

724
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.980
<v Speaker 3>a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a horse,</v>

725
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.290
<v Speaker 3>my kingdom for a horse so that he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>flee.</v>

726
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:12.291
<v Speaker 3>But it seems that he died in face to </v>
<v Speaker 3>face combat was hacked to pieces as far </v>

727
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 3>as like one of the last of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

728
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kings to die like that too.</v>

729
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.810
<v Speaker 3>To die in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

730
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 3>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in those sort of late 14 hundreds </v>

731
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I would say so.</v>

732
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combat went on the period I'm writing </v>

733
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:28.280
<v Speaker 3>about fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 15.</v>

734
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds was brutal and bloody brutal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bloody period at man like hernand.</v>

735
00:35:31.711 --> 00:35:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Cortez is a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a killer.</v>

736
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.680
<v Speaker 3>He's a coldblooded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a cold killer.</v>

737
00:35:37.681 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

738
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 1>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of,</v>

739
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:45.050
<v Speaker 1>that kind of experience is Israel today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it freak you out when you read </v>

740
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff about like these these days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that that,</v>

741
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that all could happen today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

742
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:55.401
<v Speaker 1>we need the wrong set of events to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to where we're not far removed as </v>

743
00:35:55.411 --> 00:36:00.411
<v Speaker 1>a species from that time in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual history,</v>

744
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 1>like gets the blink of an eye between </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and now a blink of an eye.</v>

745
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.020
<v Speaker 1>We are the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's changed.</v>

746
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some,</v>

747
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 1>there's been some social changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

748
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 1>we're still slaughtering people on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale in large scale levels.</v>

749
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hand tan face to face thing.</v>

750
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Technology has intervened a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

751
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if our society were to go into a radical</v>

752
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.971
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could find themselves facing </v>

753
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:31.190
<v Speaker 1>those contingencies very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

754
00:36:31.191 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

755
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 1>And it is in fact in a radical collapse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other parts of the world.</v>

756
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this on stage a </v>

757
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 1>lot lately because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

758
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 1>This is duck dynasty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

759
00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It's duck dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous American reality show.</v>

760
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>But one of the main guys on duck </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynasty,</v>

761
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave this speech and it's video </v>

762
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.981
<v Speaker 1>speech where he was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impending apocalypse and what they call </v>

763
00:36:58.311 --> 00:37:03.311
<v Speaker 1>the rapture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Christians think that Jesus is going </v>

764
00:37:03.311 --> 00:37:06.391
<v Speaker 1>to come and he's going to take away </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that's Christian and bring </v>

765
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 1>them to heaven and everybody else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be stuck on earth.</v>

766
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is a very elite group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go 144,000</v>

767
00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 1>of them are going to be floated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea with the rupture.</v>

768
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And he told people that they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this Nicholas cage movie that's </v>

769
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:23.610
<v Speaker 1>about to come out and called left </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>

770
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.670
<v Speaker 1>That's based on this very famous series </v>
<v Speaker 1>of books amongst the Christians have </v>

771
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 1>left behind like these these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

772
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.840
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't use somebody who doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>raptured.</v>

773
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the.</v>

774
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

775
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking stupid.</v>

776
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

777
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:42.671
<v Speaker 1>It hurts my brain to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's fascinating is that they're </v>

778
00:37:42.671 --> 00:37:44.120
<v Speaker 1>all worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's worried about the apocalypse,</v>

779
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.280
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>

780
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

781
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>but the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to certain parts of the world,</v>

782
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.500
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

783
00:37:52.501 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 1>It's in Liberia right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in Somalia right now.</v>

784
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

785
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Mogadishu.</v>

786
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in that,</v>

787
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:06.730
<v Speaker 1>that failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fine place then back then it was </v>

788
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:06.730
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

789
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 1>it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was it fine?</v>

790
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not politically correct,</v>

791
00:38:08.731 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was run by a dictator and he kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>things come.</v>

792
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:17.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that has been the case in many </v>

793
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

794
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:20.240
<v Speaker 1>that's what's argued about Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

795
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Iraq before the US </v>

796
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.141
<v Speaker 1>invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was largely superior to what it is </v>

797
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:27.141
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vastly superior to what it is now.</v>

798
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

799
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:27.980
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of not supposed to say these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

801
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 1>but honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the average Iraqi living in Iraq,</v>

802
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 1>things were a whole lot better under </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hussein.</v>

803
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It was peaceful.</v>

804
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>

805
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 4>there was not a lot of interreligious </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>

806
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 4>When was the secular state?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a secular state.</v>

807
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.720
<v Speaker 4>They in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite tolerant and,</v>

808
00:38:44.721 --> 00:38:47.530
<v Speaker 4>and all you had to do was not getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the face of Saddam Hussein.</v>

809
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 4>That was the simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the simple rule of life.</v>

810
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 4>Just don't get in the face of Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hussein.</v>

811
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 4>And that was a simple rule of life in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Somalia in the 19 seventies.</v>

812
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 4>Don't get in the face of Siad Barre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do,</v>

813
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See [inaudible] Muhammad Siad Barre,</v>

814
00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 4>who was the president of Somalia when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I went there in 1975,</v>

815
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

816
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 4>he did a number of interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

817
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 4>there's Somali language was not written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a nomadic society,</v>

818
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:15.781
<v Speaker 4>70 percent nomadic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He introduced a written script for this </v>

819
00:39:15.781 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 4>amount of language based on the Latin </v>
<v Speaker 4>alphabet.</v>

820
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.830
<v Speaker 4>This had not been possible before </v>
<v Speaker 4>because religious leaders had said they </v>

821
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 4>had to have it in the Arabic script </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were Muslims.</v>

822
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.830
<v Speaker 4>He just forced that through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he introduced a family law which </v>

823
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 4>allowed women to divorce their husbands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At that point,</v>

824
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 4>11 religious leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 shakes,</v>

825
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 4>mobilize the public and said they had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>rebel against Siad Barre.</v>

826
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he did,</v>

827
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 4>he hold those guys out of the mosque the</v>
<v Speaker 4>very same day and shot them all and that</v>

828
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:44.101
<v Speaker 4>was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the end of that argument and </v>

829
00:39:44.101 --> 00:39:45.800
<v Speaker 4>suddenly women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women could divorce their husbands and </v>

830
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.541
<v Speaker 4>the society was very free and very open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One can't imagine today from the scenes </v>

831
00:39:48.541 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 4>of horror that we see from Mogadishu </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually how peaceful it was.</v>

832
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:53.890
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be the case that in some,</v>

833
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 4>in some situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Iraq is definitely another example.</v>

834
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we in the West are constantly saying,</v>

835
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 4>we must have democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Democracy is a great thing.</v>

836
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is a great thing.</v>

837
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 4>At a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a certain level,</v>

838
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a society that's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>sectarian,</v>

839
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:11.311
<v Speaker 4>very divided into tribal interests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very divided into different religious </v>

840
00:40:11.311 --> 00:40:14.431
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's actually more comfortable if </v>

841
00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:14.431
<v Speaker 4>you have a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

842
00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:18.271
<v Speaker 4>there's a power vacuum issue that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the issue is we civilizations</v>

843
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.910
<v Speaker 1>largely operate on momentum and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have been set up in the way that </v>

844
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:30.511
<v Speaker 1>they have been in Iraq or the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been obviously in Somalia where </v>

845
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:34.741
<v Speaker 1>there's one guy who's calling all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots and they've Kinda got this whole </v>

846
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:38.251
<v Speaker 1>thing established when that guy's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>there anymore and then everyone's </v>

847
00:40:38.251 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>scrambling to be the new guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's scrambling creates chaos,</v>

848
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.530
<v Speaker 1>absolute hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it creates this intense violence </v>

849
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 1>amongst the people like they are our </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

850
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:53.790
<v Speaker 1>The people that are in that civil war </v>
<v Speaker 1>state that they're at now where various </v>

851
00:40:55.150 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>sections of their population are vying </v>
<v Speaker 1>for control of this failed state.</v>

852
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>

853
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 4>You have this hideous death cult called </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Islamic state,</v>

854
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:10.710
<v Speaker 4>which may or may not have been initially</v>
<v Speaker 4>funded and set setup by the United </v>

855
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:11.670
<v Speaker 4>States of America and it's allies who </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows who.</v>

856
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a death cult and it's just </v>

857
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 4>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it.</v>

858
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.491
<v Speaker 4>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would rather have Saddam Hussein a </v>

859
00:41:19.491 --> 00:41:19.491
<v Speaker 4>then the Islamic state.</v>

860
00:41:19.491 --> 00:41:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Crazy thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

861
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>The one evil is better than the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

862
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>These obviously we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only talking in objective reality </v>

863
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>terms here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

864
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

865
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:28.800
<v Speaker 1>it's okay</v>

866
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.750
<v Speaker 4>to be addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

867
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.200
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's evil to be a dictator.</v>

868
00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Clearly it's the same as a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so evil and wrong and we don't.</v>

869
00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Ideally we moved to a state where a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where we have no governments </v>

870
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.780
<v Speaker 4>and where people run their own lives and</v>
<v Speaker 4>peacefully negotiate with one another,</v>

871
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:46.781
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't the way it's going down </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Iraq and it's not the way it's gone </v>

872
00:41:46.781 --> 00:41:47.040
<v Speaker 4>down in the southern part of Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

873
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 4>that would be ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

874
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 4>But it's really hard to run a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

875
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 4>like the idea of a society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of taking a million people,</v>

876
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 4>500 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the number is,</v>

877
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:04.301
<v Speaker 4>and having a group of people that adhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the best interest of all the folks </v>

878
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:06.580
<v Speaker 4>that are in that society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the.</v>

879
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:07.370
<v Speaker 4>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

880
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.880
<v Speaker 4>their needs are so varied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their resources are so varied there.</v>

881
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 4>The fortune in what situation they find </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves born into is so very.</v>

882
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortunate,</v>

883
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:23.891
<v Speaker 4>sons and daughters that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep the unfortunate from getting into </v>

884
00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:25.480
<v Speaker 4>their gated community of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much crazy.</v>

885
00:42:25.481 --> 00:42:30.481
<v Speaker 4>And then you can be sure that dictators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sons and daughters are all very well </v>

886
00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 4>looked after in a dictatorship that </v>
<v Speaker 4>always happens.</v>

887
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes kids like kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

888
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 4>it always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

889
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:38.951
<v Speaker 4>that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that then generates feelings of </v>

890
00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:38.951
<v Speaker 4>anger and fury that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

891
00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:43.150
<v Speaker 4>that is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a situation where just bullets are </v>

892
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 4>flying down the street constantly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're live.</v>

893
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.920
<v Speaker 4>You live in permanent fear of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

894
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 4>that's not good either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

895
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:53.381
<v Speaker 4>The arguments that United States is </v>
<v Speaker 4>funded isis in order to build up support</v>

896
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:57.670
<v Speaker 4>for an invasion of Saudi Arabia or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria,</v>

897
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:02.940
<v Speaker 4>or rather a really terrifying and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying because I don't want to look </v>

898
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 4>into it because I don't want to know.</v>

899
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrible thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to know.</v>

900
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 4>I know that that kind of shit has </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened before,</v>

901
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 4>so when you see that it's happening now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

902
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this really going on?</v>

903
00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.870
<v Speaker 4>Is that really what's causing all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>profoundly depressing and the product?</v>

904
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that we can't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe anything that our political </v>

905
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 4>leaders and the west side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they are.</v>

906
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 4>They have been proven to be a absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>crooks.</v>

907
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:35.591
<v Speaker 4>Thieves and liars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lie by instinct all the time and </v>

908
00:43:35.591 --> 00:43:39.551
<v Speaker 4>that probably problem with constant </v>
<v Speaker 4>lying at the top levels of politics is </v>

909
00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:44.171
<v Speaker 4>that it pollutes the debate completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You suddenly can't believe anything </v>

910
00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:47.051
<v Speaker 4>that's said and that leads to suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all of all kinds of horrendous </v>

911
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:52.061
<v Speaker 4>possibilities including the funding and </v>
<v Speaker 4>setting in motion of this isis horror </v>

912
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:57.710
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't help when someone like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Julian assange comes along and exposes </v>

913
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 4>all these things that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree with and what do they do?</v>

914
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.190
<v Speaker 4>They try to get them locked up on some </v>
<v Speaker 4>trumped up charges and export them as if</v>

915
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:06.620
<v Speaker 4>they were really trying to export him </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

916
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

917
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.060
<v Speaker 4>to to Sweden and eventually to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States because of some sexual </v>

918
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 4>thing that wasn't even seems so violent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't even rape.</v>

919
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 4>It was consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some weird sexual charge.</v>

920
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Like I think they call it surprised sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

921
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not even calling it rape.</v>

922
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one thing that like if there was</v>

923
00:44:24.111 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 4>a woman who was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Julian Assan,</v>

924
00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:27.950
<v Speaker 4>she's a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drugged me,</v>

925
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:29.380
<v Speaker 4>raped me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

926
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>send that guy to Sweden,</v>

927
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 4>but they're not even saying</v>

928
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that if this isn't a charge that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>

929
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this guy has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked up in the embassy in London for </v>

930
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 1>all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

931
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very crazy situation.</v>

932
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

933
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:50.331
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird to see him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television doing these skype interviews </v>

934
00:44:50.331 --> 00:44:54.021
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that he's in this embassy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the moment he steps out of </v>

935
00:44:54.021 --> 00:44:54.021
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to snatch him up.</v>

936
00:44:54.021 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's just being protected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird loophole.</v>

937
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take,</v>

939
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take sanctuary in an embassy.</v>

940
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 1>At some it's an old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old law.</v>

941
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:06.681
<v Speaker 1>You can't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's going to have to dig a hole </v>

942
00:45:06.681 --> 00:45:09.890
<v Speaker 1>underneath that motherfucker oil out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street and then pop out of a manhole</v>

943
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>and a scoop them up in a car and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to Costa Rica or somewhere where </v>

944
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna honor that we live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when they're just that.</v>

945
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Just constant conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's even conspiracy theories </v>

946
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 1>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:29.090
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is part of the problem rather </v>

948
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:29.090
<v Speaker 1>than part of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that,</v>

949
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 1>all of that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is,</v>

950
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 1>nothing is believed anymore and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that comes from,</v>

951
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proven fact that our political </v>

952
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 1>leaders are actually liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upside to us again and again,</v>

953
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how can we,</v>

954
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.600
<v Speaker 1>how can we trust them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we entrust ourselves to them </v>

955
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they behave in that way,</v>

956
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 1>what's needed is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is transparency.</v>

957
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.910
<v Speaker 1>What's needed is open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the transparency is going </v>

958
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.910
<v Speaker 1>to be an eventuality because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet?</v>

959
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think gets blown wide open.</v>

960
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:04.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to keep secrets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it also erodes faith in the leadership </v>

961
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 1>when like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a democracy?</v>

962
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:12.111
<v Speaker 1>Is this a representative government or </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it some sort of a weird dictatorship </v>

963
00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 1>because of it is a democracy.</v>

964
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

965
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:14.510
<v Speaker 1>are you keeping that guy locked up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

966
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>How is Julian assange still locked up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I need to know.</v>

967
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Please tell me what exactly he did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to export him to the United </v>

968
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:23.570
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

969
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>he released some information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is our information to citizens </v>

970
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.360
<v Speaker 1>that this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 1>information that should be kept secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a king.</v>

972
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

973
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's information that someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>being paid with tax payer dollars.</v>

974
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of shit that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States doesn't agree with.</v>

975
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was upset by the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was released.</v>

976
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was upset by that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that collateral murder video.</v>

977
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was obsessed by this massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of data that showed there was a </v>

978
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 1>lot of coercion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of lies.</v>

979
00:46:55.741 --> 00:47:00.741
<v Speaker 1>A lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff that we don't agree with </v>

980
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is like public enemy number </v>

981
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.690
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

982
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so anti what we think of as the </v>

983
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely contrary to everything in the</v>

984
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Speaker 1>United States stands for complainant on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

985
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And so in answer to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>

986
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:17.361
<v Speaker 1>it is some kind of weird dictatorship </v>
<v Speaker 1>posturing and posing as a,</v>

987
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>as a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for,</v>

988
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.440
<v Speaker 1>for democracy to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have complete openness of </v>

989
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.350
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People must be told the truth,</v>

990
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.160
<v Speaker 1>then they can vote and make decisions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of facts.</v>

991
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>What we actually</v>

992
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 4>have in our society is the continual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very clever massaging and management of </v>

993
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.090
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

994
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 4>this so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it ceases to be democracy.</v>

995
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 4>When the voting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the voting public are fed,</v>

996
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:47.790
<v Speaker 4>lies on the basis of which they make </v>
<v Speaker 4>their decisions and vote that,</v>

997
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:52.910
<v Speaker 4>that isn't democracy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is in a way democracies are the </v>

998
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 4>worst kind of dictatorship because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this appearance of freedom.</v>

999
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 4>They have this illusion of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody can say,</v>

1000
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.470
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great because I live in a,</v>

1001
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 4>in a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least if you live in a dictatorship,</v>

1002
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:07.981
<v Speaker 4>you know you live in a dictatorship and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are certain parameters that you </v>

1003
00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 4>have to work your way around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you live in a dictatorship that</v>

1004
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:14.941
<v Speaker 4>is posing as a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more complicated and there were a </v>

1005
00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 4>lot of people truly believe and act as </v>
<v Speaker 4>if it is a democracy.</v>

1006
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:24.090
<v Speaker 4>But at the very top there's fuckery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulation and coercion and money and </v>

1007
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:30.570
<v Speaker 4>corporate greed and interests and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>military industrial complex that it's </v>

1008
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.651
<v Speaker 4>funding all of these maneuvers and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>people profiting wildly and not to </v>

1009
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 4>forget all the big corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

1010
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.970
<v Speaker 4>big pharmaceutical corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of this about management of </v>

1011
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 4>management of information that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we are given.</v>

1012
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 4>So what the Internet offers is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity for,</v>

1013
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.420
<v Speaker 4>for ordinary people who are not part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the power structure and not running a </v>

1014
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.930
<v Speaker 4>big corporation to take power back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1015
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:57.931
<v Speaker 4>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is happening and it's happening in </v>

1016
00:48:57.931 --> 00:49:00.721
<v Speaker 4>a big way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very disturbing to the powers </v>

1017
00:49:00.721 --> 00:49:00.721
<v Speaker 4>that be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:49:00.721 --> 00:49:02.560
<v Speaker 4>people want like an instant change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is almost instant the,</v>

1019
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:03.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1020
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:08.250
<v Speaker 4>the amount of time that we've actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>spent having the Internet has been </v>

1021
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.721
<v Speaker 4>pretty brief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 93 ish forest is when I gave </v>

1022
00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 4>birth yesterday and then like 2014 where</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're at now.</v>

1023
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:19.240
<v Speaker 4>It's really only been around in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>forum for the last decade,</v>

1024
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:24.270
<v Speaker 4>like 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2005 and then social media allowing </v>

1025
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 4>people to exchange information and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heat of political crisis.</v>

1026
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.240
<v Speaker 4>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been able to expose things that </v>

1027
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.701
<v Speaker 4>are happening in real time that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily would be protected by the </v>

1028
00:49:35.701 --> 00:49:39.481
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would shelter and filter the </v>

1029
00:49:39.481 --> 00:49:42.001
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's all just coming out and they </v>

1030
00:49:42.001 --> 00:49:44.311
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have to shut down the whole </v>

1031
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:44.311
<v Speaker 4>fucking internet and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries which,</v>

1032
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:44.680
<v Speaker 4>which uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very difficult,</v>

1033
00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:49.900
<v Speaker 4>very difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I've seen the huge shift in power </v>

1034
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 4>that this has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has introduced.</v>

1035
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.590
<v Speaker 4>There was a time as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as just my own,</v>

1036
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.620
<v Speaker 4>my own small level as an author where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have depended on the goodwill of </v>

1037
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 4>the big media in order to get my ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

1038
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:07.381
<v Speaker 4>And since my ideas of sometimes being </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical and contradictory to the </v>

1039
00:50:07.381 --> 00:50:09.190
<v Speaker 4>established order of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very difficult to do that.</v>

1040
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need the big media anymore.</v>

1041
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1042
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Don't need them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not required at all.</v>

1043
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 4>They're redundant as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

1044
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 4>What does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is?</v>

1045
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 4>What is important is the community of </v>
<v Speaker 4>likeminded people that I am.</v>

1046
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I am reaching through social social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media through facebook,</v>

1047
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:25.960
<v Speaker 4>through my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through my website.</v>

1048
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:30.961
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that facebook perfect because</v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook is very problematic and is </v>

1049
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 4>itself a large corporation which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>filtering and controlling inflammation,</v>

1050
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 4>but at least it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something.</v>

1051
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 4>There's some excellent things with </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook though.</v>

1052
00:50:37.011 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 4>One of the excellent things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone is themselves like that is your</v>

1053
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 4>facebook account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is when you're posting,</v>

1054
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.180
<v Speaker 4>this is who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the most part.</v>

1055
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously there's some frauds out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1056
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of.</v>

1057
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:51.641
<v Speaker 4>When people are commenting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're commenting using their facebook </v>

1058
00:50:51.641 --> 00:50:51.641
<v Speaker 4>indeed identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:50:51.641 --> 00:50:56.290
<v Speaker 4>So like that's a real person as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to twitter or a lot of message boards </v>

1060
00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:00.791
<v Speaker 4>where you getting trolls and lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes that are posting under fake </v>

1061
00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:03.851
<v Speaker 4>names and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there that </v>

1062
00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like a sport to them to like to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shittier,</v>

1063
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 4>to rile people up.</v>

1064
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Like that always puzzles me that I kind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come across,</v>

1065
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I get relatively little of it on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook pages.</v>

1066
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 4>I have an author facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a personal facebook page.</v>

1067
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 4>I run them both parallel at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff in both of them.</v>

1068
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.720
<v Speaker 4>There's one or two people who kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>haunt me there and just always want to </v>

1069
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.411
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just always want to say negative and </v>

1070
00:51:23.411 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 4>unpleasant things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my view is go for it guy.</v>

1071
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say those things if you want to,</v>

1072
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 4>but you're always going to get that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are in the public eye.</v>

1073
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:33.070
<v Speaker 4>And the thing to be aware of is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tremendous waste of it.</v>

1074
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:38.171
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're actually doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil and someone's trying to expose </v>

1075
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:38.171
<v Speaker 4>something which you're clearly not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you were,</v>

1076
00:51:38.171 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 4>then that kind of makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these people are crusaders,</v>

1077
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:42.650
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are just what,</v>

1078
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.840
<v Speaker 4>what you call haters in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

1079
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about haters is they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>all losers.</v>

1080
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no one that lives a fulfilled,</v>

1081
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 4>successful life with an awesome family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a great relationship.</v>

1082
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 4>They're doing what they want to do for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>

1083
00:51:56.361 --> 00:52:01.361
<v Speaker 4>They're happy and at peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they also go online and a very </v>

1084
00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:02.660
<v Speaker 4>hateful things and shit on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1085
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1086
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:03.500
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1087
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a mess of wasted energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 4>and some people are really good at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like damn,</v>

1090
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.640
<v Speaker 4>if you put that energy into something </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive instead of stocking Graham </v>

1091
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 4>Hancock and fucking with them all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get a lot of shit done.</v>

1092
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 4>You exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably be a happier person.</v>

1093
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the only answer at the receiving end </v>

1094
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 4>of that is not to feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not to nourish it with angry or,</v>

1096
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 4>or hurting or her responses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1097
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're trying to do.</v>

1098
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Someone searches shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking books.</v>

1099
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 4>I wipe my ass with your book trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck with you.</v>

1100
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer is the answer is some.</v>

1101
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>Somehow what I try to do sometimes is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>just respond with love,</v>

1102
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:48.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as it's nice if it's true,</v>

1103
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 4>if it's real and I tried to do the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can.</v>

1104
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:52.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it's really hard.</v>

1105
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 4>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you do also agree.</v>

1106
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely feel this about myself,</v>

1107
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:02.530
<v Speaker 4>that some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the criticism that I've </v>

1108
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 4>received,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a extreme criticism,</v>

1109
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 4>even if it's unbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've benefited from.</v>

1110
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is yes.</v>

1111
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 4>Useful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1112
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 4>It's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1113
00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:10.590
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1114
00:53:10.591 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something to learn from that.</v>

1115
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:13.370
<v Speaker 4>It's not that that was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1116
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 4>what doesn't kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you stronger.</v>

1117
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to let,</v>

1118
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.450
<v Speaker 4>you have to learn from this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's out there.</v>

1119
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.710
<v Speaker 4>We have to engage in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some way with criticism.</v>

1120
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I've received an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism from,</v>

1121
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:29.420
<v Speaker 4>from my work and for the suggestion that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a lost civilization and the work </v>

1122
00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 4>that I've done on psychedelics and </v>
<v Speaker 4>altered states of consciousness.</v>

1123
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Just endless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1124
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 4>it's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And My,</v>

1125
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 4>my view is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you,</v>

1126
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 4>thank you for criticizing me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it.</v>

1127
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 4>If there are holes in what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if my argument is weak in a particular </v>

1128
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.870
<v Speaker 4>area and you're helping me to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right response is gratitude to them,</v>

1129
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 4>they really are in a sense working for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you in some way because I mean there's </v>

1130
00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 4>spin unwarranted criticism that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>received that have made me rethink a lot</v>

1131
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 4>of things I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's unwarranted,</v>

1132
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.540
<v Speaker 4>they've made me rethink like what is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1133
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 4>what is causing this reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's.</v>

1134
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything that I could have done</v>
<v Speaker 4>differently that could have avoided </v>

1135
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1136
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Or is this an necessary evil that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes with the business and it makes you</v>

1137
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.080
<v Speaker 4>think about things in a more complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1138
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 4>And although that might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable,</v>

1139
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some great benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1140
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 4>There's some great benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once again it's putting us,</v>

1141
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.380
<v Speaker 4>it's putting us into a real social </v>
<v Speaker 4>social situation.</v>

1142
00:54:25.381 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 4>As you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are real,</v>

1143
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like being back in the village in </v>

1144
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.451
<v Speaker 4>the old days where where you might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly criticized by one or other of </v>

1145

<v Speaker 4>national boundaries and all religious </v>

1147
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.760
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>

<v Speaker 4>taking an interest in us and I'm.</v>

1149
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm constantly receiving information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it critical,</v>

1150
00:54:52.381 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 4>some of it positive through facebook in </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular through facebook,</v>

1151
00:54:56.131 --> 00:55:01.131
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very helpful to me and I </v>

<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

1153
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:01.131
<v Speaker 4>I really appreciate it and I tried the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best I can.</v>

1154
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:03.030
<v Speaker 4>I try as much as I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>

1155
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to spend my entire day,</v>

1156
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.600
<v Speaker 4>morning to night on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I try to engage with that.</v>

1157
00:55:09.601 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I try to respond because I realized that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are giving me that time.</v>

1158
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Somebody sends me a link to a story I </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't ever seen before.</v>

1159
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 4>It's really important for my research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1160
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 4>That's really great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twitter's giant for that for me.</v>

1161
00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:25.770
<v Speaker 4>Just absolutely gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten more information from </v>

1162
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.911
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting websites that people </v>

1163
00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:31.881
<v Speaker 4>have sent me to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting articles that people </v>

1164
00:55:31.881 --> 00:55:34.021
<v Speaker 4>have sent me to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then any other resources that I've ever </v>

1165
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:36.710
<v Speaker 4>been in contact with and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly because of interacting with </v>

1166
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.650
<v Speaker 4>people and when they send me interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1167
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:42.651
<v Speaker 4>I retweet them and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those retweets gets seen by a large </v>

1168
00:55:42.651 --> 00:55:46.401
<v Speaker 4>number of people so that people see that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that and so they send me more </v>

1169
00:55:46.401 --> 00:55:46.401
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1170
00:55:46.401 --> 00:55:50.510
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that it's like a establishing a </v>

1171
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:54.351
<v Speaker 4>network in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really a whole new situation which </v>

1172
00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:58.580
<v Speaker 4>we've not faced before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done on a done on a gigantic scale and </v>

1173
00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:03.241
<v Speaker 4>and what it means is that information </v>
<v Speaker 4>which used to be strictly controlled and</v>

1174
00:56:06.091 --> 00:56:11.091
<v Speaker 4>in the hands of elites is now changing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the power structure of information is </v>

1175
00:56:11.091 --> 00:56:16.071
<v Speaker 4>changing entirely and that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially a very exciting new time to </v>

1176
00:56:16.071 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 4>live in and great things are coming out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and it's easy to say this,</v>

1177
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 4>but I think a new consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dawning in the world.</v>

1178
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's very big yet.</v>

1179
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.330
<v Speaker 4>I think the old way of doing things is </v>
<v Speaker 4>still extremely strong,</v>

1180
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 4>but people are waking up to that power </v>
<v Speaker 4>and saying,</v>

1181
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:37.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not simply a to be pushed around </v>

1182
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:41.521
<v Speaker 4>and told what to do by an expert or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>government official or a corporation.</v>

1183
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.020
<v Speaker 4>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

1184
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:49.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe you're correct and I think </v>

1185
00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:49.050
<v Speaker 4>that it's hard to see while you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of it.</v>

1186
00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's all happening while we're,</v>

1187
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're participating in it.</v>

1188
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 4>We are living in a time of extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 4>rapid,</v>

1189
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.120
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable change and when the history</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this time maybe things will settle </v>

1190
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:03.120
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they won't,</v>

1191
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.651
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when the history of this time comes </v>

1192
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:07.651
<v Speaker 4>to be written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have to be some perspective on a</v>

1193
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:08.410
<v Speaker 4>200,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 years from now.</v>

1194
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Speaker 4>It will be seen as one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary moments in the whole human</v>

1195
00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:17.341
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr My friend Amber Lyon has an </v>

1196
00:57:17.341 --> 00:57:19.651
<v Speaker 4>interesting way of talking about certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>events and one of the things that she </v>

1197
00:57:19.651 --> 00:57:23.941
<v Speaker 4>talks about when it comes to a corporate</v>
<v Speaker 4>control of information and like things </v>

1198
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 4>on the lines of like the Juliana songs </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1199
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:32.520
<v Speaker 4>She talks about being on the wrong side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of history and I think that's a very </v>

1200
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.811
<v Speaker 4>good point that they're the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are trying to suppress inflammation in </v>

1201
00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:40.831
<v Speaker 4>that way and the information that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly affect the lives and not just </v>

1202
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 4>but the consciousness of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture that that's the wrong side of </v>

1203
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 4>history and all things are said and </v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

1204
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:53.080
<v Speaker 4>People trying to act in their best </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest currently.</v>

1205
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 4>They don't realize like the fucking Jig </v>
<v Speaker 4>is up,</v>

1206
00:57:55.151 --> 00:58:00.151
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be able to hang on and keep </v>

1207
00:58:00.151 --> 00:58:00.151
<v Speaker 4>treading water for another three or four</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

1208
00:58:00.151 --> 00:58:00.350
<v Speaker 4>but the Jig is up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like the inquisition was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong side of history.</v>

1210
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:08.191
<v Speaker 4>You know when it made it made Galileo's </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that actually the sun did revolve </v>

1211
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 4>around the earth even though he knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the earth moved there.</v>

1212
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:13.780
<v Speaker 4>It's clear that the Galileo was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right side of history.</v>

1213
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 4>We know that now we've got perspective </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

1214
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 4>We can look back with hindsight and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same.</v>

1215
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>today in different ways.</v>

1216
00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

1217
00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just more.</v>

1218
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.920
<v Speaker 4>It's more intense because it's happening</v>
<v Speaker 4>worldwide and it's all happening at the </v>

1219
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 4>same time and we're seeing positive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative repercussions of it.</v>

1220
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Like these failed states that come about</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of Arab spring.</v>

1221
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get rid of the dictator and then </v>

1222
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mark,</v>

1223
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Pandora's box is filled and now Libya is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this and how world hell world.</v>

1224
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Syria as a helloworld,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq's a hell world in every case.</v>

1225
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Pandora's box has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been opened and the immediate result</v>

1226
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:59.410
<v Speaker 4>has been the things got way worse than </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse than they were before.</v>

1227
00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1228
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're talking about the dark side,</v>

1229
00:59:02.981 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 4>the negative side of things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is this,</v>

1230
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.260
<v Speaker 4>this horrible problem of bigoted </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious fundamentalism which is,</v>

1231
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 4>which is not confined to the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 4>world by any means.</v>

1232
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

1233
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.780
<v Speaker 4>there are many Christian bigots as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a tendency for people cling on </v>

1234
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:27.040
<v Speaker 4>to old and devalued ideas and to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>her have an almost religious for </v>

1235
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 4>fanatical commitment to them and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing,</v>

1236
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what idea is worth killing another </v>

1237
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:36.760
<v Speaker 4>fellow human being for because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't share your idea of.</v>

1238
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is demonic.</v>

1239
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrendous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrendous situation that this happened.</v>

1240
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 4>I followed a few guys on twitter that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are a part of that whole Islamic state.</v>

1241
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:50.770
<v Speaker 4>There was an article about this guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a rapper who is suspected a rapper </v>

1242
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:56.891
<v Speaker 4>from London suspected of being one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys that beheaded one of the </v>

1243
00:59:56.891 --> 00:59:56.960
<v Speaker 4>American journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1244
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 4>I was following his twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like his band,</v>

1245
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 4>his twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1246
01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

1247
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 4>it was so strange to see what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1248
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:12.370
<v Speaker 4>And also strange to see his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was this thing that was going on </v>

1249
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:16.880
<v Speaker 4>with his interaction with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other people.</v>

1250
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:21.881
<v Speaker 4>There was this intense camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this intense comradery with his other </v>

1251
01:00:21.881 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Islamic warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1252
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:25.430
<v Speaker 4>that they all looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was brothers.</v>

1253
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 4>And sisters and everyone was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1254
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:32.830
<v Speaker 4>it was all great intensity to all of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions that were being made and great</v>

1255
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:35.400
<v Speaker 4>intensity to the bonds they all had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1256
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 4>fighting against what they thought was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the evil United States.</v>

1257
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 4>And unfortunately there was also some </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that he said that,</v>

1258
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about.</v>

1259
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's freaking out that one head </v>
<v Speaker 4>got cut off,</v>

1260
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Speaker 4>one body part got cut off of this one </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

1261
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:55.150
<v Speaker 4>But what about the thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are blown to bits by these drones </v>

1262
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 4>that no one's talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's undeniable.</v>

1263
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.500
<v Speaker 4>That is undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a,</v>

1264
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 4>that is absolutely true.</v>

1265
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Two wrongs never make a right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they do not.</v>

1266
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the fight that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens does not excuse the,</v>

1267
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 4>the cold blooded slicing off of fellow </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings head.</v>

1268
01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 4>But nevertheless it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should not.</v>

1269
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 4>We should not condemn the one without </v>
<v Speaker 4>condemning the other as well.</v>

1270
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>

1271
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.960
<v Speaker 4>the one you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about one individual as </v>

1272
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.041
<v Speaker 4>opposed to thousands of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been killed by drones that are innocent </v>

1273
01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:30.660
<v Speaker 4>but completely innocent people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>so called collateral damage just ripped </v>

1274
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 4>upon by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by our high tech weapons,</v>

1275
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:34.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1276
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which will be had a person in an,</v>

1277
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:41.830
<v Speaker 4>in an instance slice buddy parts off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just completely destroy that if you're </v>

1278
01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 4>lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're lucky,</v>

1279
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:47.861
<v Speaker 4>they only break off a few things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to suffer for the rest of </v>

1280
01:01:47.861 --> 01:01:48.620
<v Speaker 4>your life and agonizing pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to own this,</v>

1281
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.590
<v Speaker 4>we have to take that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to accept that this is,</v>

1282
01:01:50.591 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 4>this is something we do.</v>

1283
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 4>We in the West are not innocent of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>barbarity.</v>

1284
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 4>We're also part of it is it we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1285
01:01:58.821 --> 01:02:03.821
<v Speaker 4>that's the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the real thing because then </v>

1286
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.651
<v Speaker 4>you come back to the question of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulation of public opinion by very </v>

1287
01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:10.511
<v Speaker 4>small interest groups who have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have a very unbalanced a control of </v>

1288
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 4>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1289
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.070
<v Speaker 4>And then who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1290
01:02:14.071 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is we mean?</v>

1291
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:17.630
<v Speaker 4>If it's not you and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1292
01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 4>do we take responsibility for people we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even know,</v>

1293
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:25.100
<v Speaker 4>doing things that are under the orders </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people we also don't know and under </v>

1294
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:29.151
<v Speaker 4>the influence of corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not really exactly sure who's </v>

1295
01:02:29.151 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 4>pulling the strings or how it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>done or what politicians are moving,</v>

1296
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>what pieces into place and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is when we take responsibility for</v>

1297
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:38.320
<v Speaker 4>standing by and letting bad shit happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not think about it somehow or other,</v>

1298
01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 4>it didn't fail to fail to act.</v>

1299
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 4>When when we know that something really </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong is being done in our name,</v>

1300
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is as bad as doing it ourselves.</v>

1301
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen the interview?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an interview that's out there.</v>

1302
01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:54.530
<v Speaker 4>One of the guys that say who was a drone</v>
<v Speaker 4>pilot and he was responsible for don't </v>

1303
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 4>know a large number of deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he would describe what it was like </v>

1304
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 4>to be a drone pilot and what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1305
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to to operate these death machines and </v>

1306
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.940
<v Speaker 4>fly to the sky and just launched rockets</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how crazy it was and this.</v>

1307
01:03:09.941 --> 01:03:13.890
<v Speaker 4>This is a new thing that didn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 4>decades ago.</v>

1308
01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Didn't exist during the first Gulf War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no drones.</v>

1309
01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's this idea of precision </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks by automated machines that fly </v>

1310
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 4>around the Air Launch Hellfire missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1311
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 4>what a fucking crazy name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call them hell fire.</v>

1312
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1313
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it becomes like a computer game.</v>

1314
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at it on a screen and </v>

1315
01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:37.330
<v Speaker 4>completely detached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>

1316
01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:41.390
<v Speaker 4>completely detached from the Mass Med or</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are in fact inflicting what a </v>

1317
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 4>dark world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a dark.</v>

1318
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:46.850
<v Speaker 4>We live in a dark time and the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1319
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 4>the only thing is that there is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>light which is growing.</v>

1320
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:55.670
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is the capacity for love human </v>

1321
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.670
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>

1322
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:58.700
<v Speaker 4>we are capable of love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It involves detaching ourselves from </v>

1323
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 4>controlling orders and actually thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>as human beings thinking for ourselves.</v>

1324
01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 4>Very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is.</v>

1325
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 4>I think it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think that that conflict,</v>

1326
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:12.580
<v Speaker 4>the conflict of battling against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative builds up the positive.</v>

1327
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Some strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

1328
01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.750
<v Speaker 4>the antiwar movement was really a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of what made the hippie movement of</v>

1329
01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:23.751
<v Speaker 4>the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that was a lot of it was in </v>

1330
01:04:23.751 --> 01:04:26.181
<v Speaker 4>response to the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this war that people knew to be unjust </v>

1331
01:04:26.181 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 4>and so this flower power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>

1332
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:33.530
<v Speaker 4>power movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lsd and marijuana and all that came out </v>

1333
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.530
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

1334
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:38.450
<v Speaker 4>That very resistance to killing people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't do anything bad to us,</v>

1335
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 4>produce this very positive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then of course that was a then a </v>

1336
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 4>counter reaction to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we call the war on drugs,</v>

1337
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 4>which slapped down on that and shut it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut it all down again.</v>

1338
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not big into supernatural </v>

1339
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I look at all of this,</v>

1340
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:59.670
<v Speaker 4>I have to say the gnostics who you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1341
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 4>If I simplify the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea gnostic ideas,</v>

1342
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:08.030
<v Speaker 4>the knowledge we know about gnostic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas because a batch of texts were </v>

1343
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.460
<v Speaker 4>found buried at a place called not </v>
<v Speaker 4>commodity and Upper Egypt in the air.</v>

1344
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:13.740
<v Speaker 4>The temple of Dendur in Upper Egypt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd been married for 1000,</v>

1345
01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:18.741
<v Speaker 4>600 years and they were founded in 1945 </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can contain a complete corpus </v>

1346
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:24.721
<v Speaker 4>of ideas of people who call themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gnostics and they see a dark force </v>

1347
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:31.591
<v Speaker 4>at work in the universe which is which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is seeking to snuff out the divine spark</v>

1348
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:37.590
<v Speaker 4>in humanity and it's a supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 4>force and what they say is that the </v>

1349
01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:42.391
<v Speaker 4>entity who we've been taught for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last 2000 plus years to believe is God.</v>

1350
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't the entered the Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the god of Abraham who may be called </v>

1351
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.861
<v Speaker 4>Yahweh or who may be called Allah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that from the gnostic point of </v>

1352
01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:53.110
<v Speaker 4>view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a god at all.</v>

1353
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a demon.</v>

1354
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.700
<v Speaker 4>That's a lower level supernatural who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>got this huge inflated ego who wants to </v>

1355
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:05.791
<v Speaker 4>be praised and worshiped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's constantly urging his followers </v>

1356
01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 4>onto acts of violence and war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's.</v>

1357
01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1358
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 4>we cannot say there are any facts in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this area.</v>

1359
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just the dark side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human psyche and maybe it's all </v>

1360
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 4>generated by our brains or maybe there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a supernatural realm,</v>

1361
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:19.920
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's A.</v>

1362
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I think gnosticism is a very useful tool</v>
<v Speaker 4>to look at.</v>

1363
01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:29.911
<v Speaker 4>The society we live in today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believed that there were entities </v>

1364
01:06:29.911 --> 01:06:33.211
<v Speaker 4>called Arkansans who are evil angels who</v>
<v Speaker 4>disguise themselves as human beings and </v>

1365
01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:37.801
<v Speaker 4>mingle with us to drive us into all </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner of crimes and behavior that is </v>

1366
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 4>hostile to the nature of the soul and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I see happening everywhere,</v>

1367
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:46.321
<v Speaker 4>but they believed fundamentally we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>good and that we have this light within </v>

1368
01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:48.520
<v Speaker 4>us and that that the way to reveal that </v>
<v Speaker 4>light is through.</v>

1369
01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.900
<v Speaker 4>It's through knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the serpent in the garden of </v>

1370
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.130
<v Speaker 4>Eden is the good guy in the gnostic </v>
<v Speaker 4>frame of reference.</v>

1371
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.680
<v Speaker 4>That's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The serpent being a good guy.</v>

1372
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 4>He's the good guy because he's saying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam and eve,</v>

1373
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:02.260
<v Speaker 4>you have to know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>good and evil.</v>

1374
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:07.650
<v Speaker 4>You can't just be these thoughtless meet</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures you know who are wandering </v>

1375
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:12.310
<v Speaker 4>around in a happy days in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to grow and develop,</v>

1376
01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:17.311
<v Speaker 4>you have to make choices between good </v>
<v Speaker 4>and evil and it's the tree of knowledge </v>

1377
01:07:17.311 --> 01:07:20.821
<v Speaker 4>of good and evil that the serpent </v>
<v Speaker 4>introduces Adam and Eve to and says you </v>

1378
01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:22.170
<v Speaker 4>need to eat from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1379
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1380
01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.140
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually I,</v>

1381
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.680
<v Speaker 4>I would say this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do need to.</v>

1382
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.700
<v Speaker 4>We are defined by our choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's through our choices that we grow </v>

1383
01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 4>and if we're ignorant of the context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can we help to grow?</v>

1384
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:33.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

1385
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stories of like Adam and eve and </v>

1386
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1387
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1388
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:39.250
<v Speaker 4>it's allegorical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1389
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:40.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be there.</v>

1390
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.600
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an allegory to certainly an </v>

1391
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:45.600
<v Speaker 4>allegory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

1392
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 4>So there's certainly an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an allegory that's real serpent,</v>

1393
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't read it as a real,</v>

1394
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 4>a real apple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean actually for the Gnostics,</v>

1395
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 4>it very clearly and definitely it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic mushroom when the gnostics </v>

1396
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:00.470
<v Speaker 4>portray the tree of life and the God </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1397
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tree of knowledge of good and evil </v>

1398
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:05.570
<v Speaker 4>in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1399
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:05.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm an eater Mascaro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the flag agric.</v>

1400
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.430
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1401
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:11.431
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes there's a Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a visionary substance,</v>

1402
01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 4>which they were say depicting that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way from the gnostic point of view</v>

1403
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 3>is a necessary part of the liberation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit that we.</v>

1404
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:20.630
<v Speaker 3>That it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1405
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.300
<v Speaker 3>it's an an agent for awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the serpent was giving.</v>

1406
01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:29.301
<v Speaker 3>Now I know that all the fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians out there are going to say </v>

1407
01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 3>hancock is a devil worshiper because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying that the serpent is the good</v>

1408
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:35.021
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what the gnostics said and </v>

1409
01:08:35.021 --> 01:08:37.391
<v Speaker 3>there was a deep and ancient study of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mystery of life and the mystery of </v>

1410
01:08:37.391 --> 01:08:37.391
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1411
01:08:37.391 --> 01:08:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I've read somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the source,</v>

1412
01:08:38.371 --> 01:08:43.371
<v Speaker 1>but I read somewhere where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the interpretations of </v>

1413
01:08:43.371 --> 01:08:46.500
<v Speaker 1>ancient languages and the translations </v>
<v Speaker 1>from ancient Hebrew,</v>

1414
01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all to Greek Latin.</v>

1415
01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:53.580
<v Speaker 1>That a lot of things got lost along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in the confusion and that one of the</v>

1416
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 1>confusions was that the word apple could</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be interpreted also as red and </v>

1417
01:09:01.621 --> 01:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>then it wasn't an apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it was a red and that red being</v>

1418
01:09:05.611 --> 01:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the color of the and area that that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1419
01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's folks have to understand </v>

1420
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.490
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never tried to pay attention to </v>

1421
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:19.641
<v Speaker 1>how people translate ancient languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to translate them several </v>

1422
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just into,</v>

1423
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from ancient Hebrew to Latin,</v>

1424
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:27.010
<v Speaker 1>but also from Latin degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Greek to English.</v>

1425
01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>There's so much that gets weirded out </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>

1426
01:09:29.971 --> 01:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've ever taken a phrase from </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Russian,</v>

1427
01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>a website where you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying and then put it into like</v>

1428
01:09:37.681 --> 01:09:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Google translate and you see the English</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of what they're saying.</v>

1429
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so convoluted and confusing because</v>

1430
01:09:43.741 --> 01:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>of the way the structure of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is very different.</v>

1431
01:09:46.351 --> 01:09:51.351
<v Speaker 1>The grammar that they use is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and that it's nothing in </v>

1432
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 1>comparison to how different it was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient time.</v>

1433
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot get lost in translation and the </v>

1434
01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.340
<v Speaker 3>translator imposes his or her idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>how things should.</v>

1435
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Of course on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the material and many of the texts </v>

1436
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.030
<v Speaker 3>that come down to us are highly edited </v>
<v Speaker 3>artifacts which are,</v>

1437
01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:08.370
<v Speaker 3>which are actually representing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular point of view.</v>

1438
01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:13.371
<v Speaker 3>That's why these hidden gnostic texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which just lay buried for 1600 years </v>

1439
01:10:13.371 --> 01:10:16.980
<v Speaker 3>until they were found in the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are extremely,</v>

1440
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.120
<v Speaker 3>extremely interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1441
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.220
<v Speaker 3>and actually we don't need to rely on </v>
<v Speaker 3>translations there.</v>

1442
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:26.221
<v Speaker 3>They're worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the gnostics were wiped out by </v>

1443
01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:29.961
<v Speaker 3>Christianity when Christianity pooled on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jackboot of Rome and became the </v>

1444
01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:35.481
<v Speaker 3>state religion of the most powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>militaristic empire of the ancient </v>

1445
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:35.481
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1446
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:39.800
<v Speaker 3>it's set about destroying all </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitors and amongst those that </v>

1447
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.161
<v Speaker 3>destroyed were the Gnostics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly they were burnt at the </v>

1448
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:45.510
<v Speaker 3>stake from a very early date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some gnostic sects survived and they</v>

1449
01:10:45.511 --> 01:10:50.511
<v Speaker 3>have left us images and there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of gnostic churches these guys </v>

1450
01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:54.111
<v Speaker 3>saw themselves as Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a number of gnostic churches </v>

1451
01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:55.440
<v Speaker 3>where they painted the tree of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of good and evil,</v>

1452
01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.660
<v Speaker 3>quite specifically as I'm one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mascaro.</v>

1453
01:10:57.661 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1454
01:10:58.230 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1455
01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in French frescoes,</v>

1456
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.220
<v Speaker 1>what does that fresco from like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1457
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.280
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the year,</v>

1458
01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but it was an Adam and eve portrayal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that showed several different types of </v>

1459
01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:13.190
<v Speaker 1>types of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

1460
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's Adam and eve clearly standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1461
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 3>And it makes you wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was in not modern times,</v>

1462
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but not 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1463
01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 3>This was like 1200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight days,</v>

1464
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.570
<v Speaker 3>just like say 800 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1465
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.670
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at the tail end of the last </v>

1466
01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:33.830
<v Speaker 3>surviving Gnostics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cathars in the southwest of France,</v>

1467
01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.520
<v Speaker 3>or an example of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a gnostic,</v>

1468
01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.780
<v Speaker 3>a sect who survived through until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic church wipe them out with the </v>

1469
01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:46.191
<v Speaker 3>so called Albert Jensen Crusades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a truly horrendous act of ethnic murder </v>

1470
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:51.530
<v Speaker 3>that took place in the 12 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're actually not that long ago and </v>

1471
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 3>things have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have survived from that time.</v>

1472
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.030
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting that,</v>

1473
01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:02.150
<v Speaker 3>that they are clearly indicating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelic experience is of crucial</v>

1474
01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:08.271
<v Speaker 3>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's a liberating experience that </v>

1475
01:12:08.271 --> 01:12:09.060
<v Speaker 3>allows us to wake up to the true nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

1476
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1477
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:10.440
<v Speaker 3>they would do it right.</v>

1478
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:14.670
<v Speaker 3>They would do it in a sacred context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would work very hard on the setting</v>

1479
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 3>to create the place and the space where </v>
<v Speaker 3>this experience unfolded.</v>

1480
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Because that's part of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The substance on its own is only part of</v>

1481
01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:27.501
<v Speaker 3>the story is anybody who's worked with </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics knows the context in which </v>

1482
01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:31.551
<v Speaker 3>the experience unfolds is at least as </v>
<v Speaker 3>important and the intent with which you </v>

1483
01:12:31.551 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 3>go into it and what we're seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1484
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 3>history has been obscured from us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but recent research is showing,</v>

1485
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:43.041
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the famous Eleusinian mysteries in </v>

1486
01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Greece 2000 years at the temple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>abuses.</v>

1487
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
<v Speaker 3>It pilgrims came from all over Greece </v>
<v Speaker 3>once a year to undergo and experience </v>

1488
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.300
<v Speaker 3>and that experience involve drinking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>brew.</v>

1489
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.830
<v Speaker 3>We can now say with absolute certainty </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was a brew closely.</v>

1490
01:12:55.950 --> 01:13:00.090
<v Speaker 3>There were elements in it closely </v>
<v Speaker 3>related to Lsd and that this,</v>

1491
01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:02.820
<v Speaker 3>do we know that with absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the work has been,</v>

1492
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.780
<v Speaker 3>the work has been done by Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Gordon Wasson and others.</v>

1493
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1494
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:11.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a very detailed study of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in that brew.</v>

1495
01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:16.291
<v Speaker 3>It was called the Chi on and growing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the barley that was used in the brew </v>

1496
01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:16.970
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an Erg,</v>

1497
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:20.920
<v Speaker 3>got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a form of got a which contained Lsd,</v>

1498
01:13:20.921 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 3>a Mites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and which was soluble in water.</v>

1499
01:13:23.101 --> 01:13:28.101
<v Speaker 3>They've really done the science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>great in great depth and when you read </v>

1500
01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:31.761
<v Speaker 3>the accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know of of great figures from the </v>

1501
01:13:31.761 --> 01:13:34.161
<v Speaker 3>ancient world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like plato or socrates who went </v>

1502
01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:34.161
<v Speaker 3>and had the experience at the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1503
01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:35.460
<v Speaker 3>mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they drink this.</v>

1504
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:40.461
<v Speaker 3>They enter a darkened series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>corridors and passageways and chambers </v>

1505
01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:43.911
<v Speaker 3>in this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge template and this is light </v>

1506
01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:45.750
<v Speaker 3>appears and they start seeing visions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty obvious what's going on.</v>

1507
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious that they were tripping </v>

1508
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.110
<v Speaker 3>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form,</v>

1509
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 3>and they saw it as nurturing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They saw it as nurturing.</v>

1510
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:56.490
<v Speaker 3>They felt that there were several of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancients who had this experience and who</v>

1511
01:13:56.491 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 3>said that after having had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1512
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 3>they lost their fear of death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

1513
01:14:00.511 --> 01:14:03.750
<v Speaker 3>That they understood that it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was not the end.</v>

1514
01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Now we could argue about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was the experience that they.</v>

1515
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 3>That they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:12.471
<v Speaker 3>That's the experience that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have when they take asset of the </v>

1517
01:14:12.471 --> 01:14:12.471
<v Speaker 3>things that Larry Hagman</v>

1518
01:14:12.471 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is popular American actor.</v>

1519
01:14:15.431 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 1>He did this interview when he was on CNN</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking to him about death</v>

1520
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and he said that lsd completely took </v>
<v Speaker 1>away his fear of death and he just </v>

1521
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't mean what it meant before.</v>

1522
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Just because you realize you're part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1523
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.550
<v Speaker 1>be part of something that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1524
01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it is important to have a sense of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's important to brush your </v>

1525
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:43.681
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to pay attention when </v>

1526
01:14:43.681 --> 01:14:46.261
<v Speaker 1>you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to take care of your </v>

1527
01:14:46.261 --> 01:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>health while you're alive or you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer some ill consequences,</v>

1528
01:14:47.231 --> 01:14:52.231
<v Speaker 1>but it's also important to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of your need to take care of </v>

1529
01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:55.330
<v Speaker 1>yourself can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can overwhelm your greater perspective.</v>

1530
01:14:55.540 --> 01:15:00.540
<v Speaker 1>The greater perspective of being a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything in that it's not just </v>

1531
01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:05.461
<v Speaker 1>about you and the worst cases of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are the ego's run a muck </v>

1532
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.580
<v Speaker 1>like the dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Saddam Hussein or the anyone who </v>

1533
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:12.220
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of them.</v>

1534
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's all about them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge insane,</v>

1535
01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and they cut people down and smash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy and kill and leave horrible,</v>

1536
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:28.111
<v Speaker 1>horrible lives in the wake of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous detachment.</v>

1537
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:33.580
<v Speaker 1>From these universal ideas that we are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a giant collective consciousness</v>

1538
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:39.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to get to that </v>

1539
01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 1>without something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's yoga,</v>

1540
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:45.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's something that you ingest </v>

1541
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that gets you to that understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that understanding is very difficult to </v>

1542
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:53.311
<v Speaker 1>realize with our normal conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>than their normal alpha male primate </v>

1543
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:55.140
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

1544
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the problem solving state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

1545
01:15:57.681 --> 01:16:02.681
<v Speaker 3>that's that state of consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not our friend when it comes to </v>

1546
01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:04.880
<v Speaker 3>understanding our place in the wider </v>
<v Speaker 3>scheme of things.</v>

1547
01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:09.650
<v Speaker 3>It is a friend in many ways and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good state of consciousness.</v>

1548
01:16:09.651 --> 01:16:12.140
<v Speaker 3>But there are so many other states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that are,</v>

1549
01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.210
<v Speaker 3>that are a volume and the need to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>

1550
01:16:14.211 --> 01:16:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are very lucky and they can,</v>

1551
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.410
<v Speaker 3>they can get into deeply altered states </v>
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness and,</v>

1552
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.360
<v Speaker 3>and see reality in a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1553
01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:25.610
<v Speaker 3>without needing to take any substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine,</v>

1554
01:16:25.611 --> 01:16:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they can get there through meditation</v>

1555
01:16:28.431 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 3>or they can get there through floating </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a flotation tank.</v>

1556
01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.110
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a lot of people,</v>

1557
01:16:33.111 --> 01:16:38.111
<v Speaker 3>a very powerful vehicle for changing our</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on the nature of reality has</v>

1558
01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:45.161
<v Speaker 3>been for thousands of years the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience and it's time </v>

1559
01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:45.161
<v Speaker 3>that we rehabilitated that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1560
01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:46.640
<v Speaker 3>and gave it a place in our society.</v>

1561
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as you were talking about </v>

1562
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 1>earlier that this is a time of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1563
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a time of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening when it comes to psychedelics.</v>

1564
01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this Guy Sturgill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Simpson.</v>

1565
01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a country music singer who </v>

1566
01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>sings about dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1567
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't come across some men as country</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

1568
01:17:04.731 --> 01:17:09.731
<v Speaker 1>like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waylon Jennings style country music if </v>

1569
01:17:09.731 --> 01:17:09.731
<v Speaker 1>you're into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am.</v>

1570
01:17:09.731 --> 01:17:13.331
<v Speaker 1>I liked that kind of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been really into that of the last </v>

1571
01:17:13.331 --> 01:17:13.490
<v Speaker 1>couple of years I've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always been a Johnny Cash fan.</v>

1572
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I've always liked dwight yoakam and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>country singers,</v>

1573
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but I've gotten into a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff recently.</v>

1574
01:17:18.741 --> 01:17:23.741
<v Speaker 1>But this guy sturgill simpson is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big part of what he's saying about </v>

1575
01:17:23.741 --> 01:17:26.510
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and in a country song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1576
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.020
<v Speaker 1>incredible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that to me just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>highlights that this is spreading </v>

1578
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>through a bunch of different genres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different art forms.</v>

1579
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of psychedelic art now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just Alex Gray who's the master,</v>

1580
01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but you see others that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

1581
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 1>a lot of psychedelic art work.</v>

1582
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I see it all the time when I go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak at events,</v>

1583
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:52.061
<v Speaker 3>at conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come to me with their aunt and </v>

1584
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:54.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing this trip to huge explosion </v>

1585
01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a visionary creativity,</v>

1586
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking,</v>

1587
01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.120
<v Speaker 3>taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm constantly meeting people whose </v>

1588
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:01.120
<v Speaker 3>lives have been transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1589
01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by these experiences.</v>

1590
01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed by guys like you who have </v>

1591
01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:13.411
<v Speaker 1>written books on these experiences from </v>
<v Speaker 1>supernatural to your own discussions,</v>

1592
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.540
<v Speaker 1>including the one that got banned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted,</v>

1593
01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ted thing has kind of been exposed as </v>

1594
01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:25.231
<v Speaker 1>being this really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost cultish thing that it's done a </v>

1595
01:18:25.231 --> 01:18:25.231
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1596
01:18:25.231 --> 01:18:29.461
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of a lot of the speakers </v>

1597
01:18:29.461 --> 01:18:33.900
<v Speaker 1>that have come on Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had Eddie Wong on the show where </v>

1598
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:37.501
<v Speaker 1>he talked about his experience and Ted </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they kicked him out because he </v>

1599
01:18:37.501 --> 01:18:40.261
<v Speaker 1>left there to do my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted them to be a part of this </v>

1600
01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>whole thing all day where you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out.</v>

1601
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He had to stay in a hotel room with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else like they made him.</v>

1602
01:18:44.021 --> 01:18:49.021
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I get my own hotel room that know </v>

1603
01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:50.911
<v Speaker 1>the Ted Experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to shack up with some fucking </v>

1604
01:18:50.911 --> 01:18:51.460
<v Speaker 1>random dude who's talking about physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>

1605
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.750
<v Speaker 1>We want everybody to be together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>

1606
01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1607
01:18:56.381 --> 01:19:01.381
<v Speaker 1>it's also become intensely profitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when things become intensely </v>

1608
01:19:01.381 --> 01:19:02.530
<v Speaker 1>profitable and they come to this giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1609
01:19:02.531 --> 01:19:07.531
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of why your talk got banned </v>

1610
01:19:07.531 --> 01:19:11.071
<v Speaker 1>from Ted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having an open discourse </v>

1611
01:19:11.071 --> 01:19:12.400
<v Speaker 1>about agreeing or disagreeing about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>

1612
01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.640
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your ted talk got banned because of </v>

1613
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.901
<v Speaker 1>pressure from a bunch of people there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying that you start using the </v>

1614
01:19:21.901 --> 01:19:23.750
<v Speaker 1>word pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pseudoscience stop the pseudo science.</v>

1615
01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost a cult of people that are</v>

1616
01:19:26.921 --> 01:19:31.921
<v Speaker 1>afraid of debating ideas that are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial and very difficult to nail</v>

1617
01:19:32.171 --> 01:19:33.760
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're talking about the</v>

1618
01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:37.630
<v Speaker 1>emergence of consciousness in early man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1619
01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>No one knows how the fuck people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>from hunting things to drawing on cave </v>

1620
01:19:43.271 --> 01:19:47.290
<v Speaker 1>walls to experiencing visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychedelic states.</v>

1621
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.760
<v Speaker 1>But we do know that happened.</v>

1622
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened,</v>

1623
01:19:50.111 --> 01:19:51.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's worth talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.790
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like 1940,</v>

1625
01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:59.791
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it was when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out Iowasca whatever year it </v>

1626
01:19:59.791 --> 01:19:59.940
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was it?</v>

1627
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Goes back a very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1628
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.880
<v Speaker 1>but I mean Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they.</v>

1629
01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:06.760
<v Speaker 1>When Mckenna talked about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1630
01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:11.761
<v Speaker 1>when they harming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to call it telepathy </v>

1631
01:20:11.761 --> 01:20:15.470
<v Speaker 1>telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they realized that it had already </v>

1632
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:16.160
<v Speaker 1>been been scientifically defined as </v>
<v Speaker 1>harming.</v>

1633
01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was.</v>

1634
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would probably be in 1930.</v>

1635
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere $30 or 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty to 20.</v>

1636
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And then Watson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon Wasson was in like the fifties.</v>

1637
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It was $50 goes down to Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters.</v>

1638
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Maria Sabina has a mushroom experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the beginning of the mushroom</v>

1639
01:20:32.371 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the West actually,</v>

1640
01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>so that's like modern western culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and civilization.</v>

1641
01:20:39.061 --> 01:20:44.061
<v Speaker 1>This is our introduction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this shit had been going on for </v>

1642
01:20:44.061 --> 01:20:44.790
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1643
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 1>So for us to assume that these you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially you and I who have had these </v>

1644
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had an Iowaska experience,</v>

1645
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but I've had many a dozen dmt trips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom trips.</v>

1646
01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something there.</v>

1647
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:03.710
<v Speaker 1>There's something there that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably intense and to deny that </v>

1648
01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:06.560
<v Speaker 1>that had an effect on consciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging people crazy.</v>

1649
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy in my opinion,</v>

1650
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 1>very anti scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely anti scientific.</v>

1651
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:17.481
<v Speaker 1>It is like the modern inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a weird thing where people are </v>

1652
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 1>ignoring that aspect and concentrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>on all the other potential aspects,</v>

1653
01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:22.890
<v Speaker 1>which I think probably worked in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a symbiotic fashion.</v>

1654
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The introduction of meat into the Diet,</v>

1655
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1656
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.520
<v Speaker 1>the experimenting with different food </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources because of the changing of the </v>

1657
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.971
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of factors that came </v>

1658
01:21:34.971 --> 01:21:37.971
<v Speaker 1>into play that made lower hominids human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings a lot of every evolutionary </v>

1659
01:21:37.971 --> 01:21:39.600
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of environmental factors,</v>

1660
01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of experimental factors.</v>

1661
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things happened where there was</v>

1662
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.460
<v Speaker 1>some benefits to certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and those people survived and </v>

1663
01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 1>then things evolved and changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

1664
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:54.120
<v Speaker 1>we have Graham Hancock here at 2014 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in front of his apple laptop.</v>

1665
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:55.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1666
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of things had to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place a lot.</v>

1667
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very complicated process,</v>

1668
01:21:59.431 --> 01:22:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'm absolutely sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics were a key word,</v>

1669
01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:08.740
<v Speaker 1>a key part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's taken psychedelics is </v>

1670
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.720
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure that it was a key part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1671
01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:14.721
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you've had the experience and </v>

1672
01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.001
<v Speaker 1>everyone who doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't had a psychedelic </v>

1673
01:22:17.001 --> 01:22:20.361
<v Speaker 1>experience and you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences being not a </v>

1674
01:22:20.361 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a noneffective,</v>

1675
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:22:21.901 --> 01:22:23.160
<v Speaker 1>You'd be better to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1677
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:26.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just nonsense because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have not had the,</v>

1678
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.420
<v Speaker 1>had the experience at all.</v>

1679
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I just don't even in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to come to the table because </v>

1680
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:33.660
<v Speaker 1>they've got nothing to bring to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

1681
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if they come to the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I find their arguments to be almost </v>

1682
01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:38.690
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1683
01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like I have a very good friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very intelligent guy and he's </v>

1684
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.850
<v Speaker 1>never taken any drugs and his take on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1685
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and he's a brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved talking to him,</v>

1686
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but his take on it is simply a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the work's been done.</v>

1687
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:53.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to learn anything new from</v>

1688
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1689
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:56.730
<v Speaker 1>well that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1690
01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn Jillette Rice.</v>

1691
01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the same,</v>

1692
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't do any drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do anything.</v>

1693
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:06.681
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he feels that there is no need for </v>

1694
01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:06.681
<v Speaker 1>him to say it's all been figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the work's been done.</v>

1695
01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:06.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1696
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:11.910
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me get you high on Dmt last 15 </v>

1697
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:12.100
<v Speaker 4>minutes and you tell me what work's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

1698
01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:13.220
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1699
01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:18.320
<v Speaker 4>that's what's so I think what's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>special about dmt in particular is that </v>

1700
01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 4>there is that there is no negotiation </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the experience.</v>

1701
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 4>There are very few people who can resist</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1702
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Once you hit the hit the threshold </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it dose and it's going to take </v>

1703
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:32.761
<v Speaker 4>you where it where it takes you a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you are confronted by one of the </v>

1704
01:23:32.761 --> 01:23:35.851
<v Speaker 4>most intense and extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences that it is possible for any </v>

1705
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 4>human being to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1706
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.640
<v Speaker 4>we can jump out of an airplane at 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>

1707
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can scale a sheer cliff.</v>

1708
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 4>That's also very intense and very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very extraordinary.</v>

1709
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can go scuba diving to the depths,</v>

1710
01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:52.480
<v Speaker 4>but if we look at the whole range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human experiences and say what is one of</v>

1711
01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:57.481
<v Speaker 4>the most intense and potentially most </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformative experiences as possible </v>

1712
01:23:57.481 --> 01:24:01.651
<v Speaker 4>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say dmt done with the right </v>

1713
01:24:01.651 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 4>intention and the right context is right</v>
<v Speaker 4>up there with anything else.</v>

1714
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 4>It's the most intense thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced.</v>

1715
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1716
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 4>I haven't experienced everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>

1717
01:24:07.181 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I've never been scuba diving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been skydiving and it doesn't</v>

1718
01:24:10.091 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 4>mean that those things aren't intense as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1719
01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:17.730
<v Speaker 4>but to deny the impact of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems silly and the people that are </v>

1720
01:24:17.921 --> 01:24:20.760
<v Speaker 4>arguing against the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1721
01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the efficacy of these experiences or </v>

1722
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.901
<v Speaker 4>against the influence of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences to have those people </v>

1723
01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:31.171
<v Speaker 4>actually have never haven't had taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>these experiences arguing against them.</v>

1724
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:33.480
<v Speaker 4>It seems so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1725
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:35.510
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that they're scared of them,</v>

1726
01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's those people are who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>running the rules in our society still.</v>

1727
01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if they,</v>

1728
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.730
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't there would be really </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying.</v>

1729
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.510
<v Speaker 4>If our society was wrong in the way it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is now by a bunch of people doing dmt,</v>

1730
01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:47.830
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1731
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

1732
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing we can be quite sure if</v>
<v Speaker 4>our society was run by a bunch of people</v>

1733
01:24:51.971 --> 01:24:53.830
<v Speaker 4>doing dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be running the way that it's</v>

1734
01:24:53.831 --> 01:24:54.540
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1735
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.210
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1736
01:24:55.211 --> 01:25:00.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makenna found out about dmt by a friend </v>

1737
01:25:00.211 --> 01:25:02.971
<v Speaker 4>who is a scientist to work with the army</v>
<v Speaker 4>research lab and they had like a barrel </v>

1738
01:25:02.971 --> 01:25:05.130
<v Speaker 4>of the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a fucking barrel of emt.</v>

1739
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 4>And if anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've,</v>

1740
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:10.120
<v Speaker 4>DMT is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very small doses,</v>

1741
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:12.070
<v Speaker 4>they're tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transformative.</v>

1742
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 4>These tiny little doses that you smoke </v>
<v Speaker 4>take you into these incredible realm.</v>

1743
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:18.460
<v Speaker 4>So the idea of a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1744
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:22.820
<v Speaker 4>or Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Mckenna described Lsd and the</v>

1745
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:27.890
<v Speaker 4>best way I've ever heard is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of Lsd you need for it to be </v>

1746
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:32.641
<v Speaker 4>effective is like an ant that can break </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the empire state building in 30 </v>

1747
01:25:32.641 --> 01:25:32.730
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like exact,</v>

1748
01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.090
<v Speaker 4>literally that little.</v>

1749
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 4>He was a great genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's um,</v>

1750
01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>it's very fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1751
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:43.370
<v Speaker 4>we have the Internet and the Terence </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna is his passed in the year 2000.</v>

1752
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 4>He's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still with us and his and he is </v>

1753
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.470
<v Speaker 4>having this liberating effect on people </v>
<v Speaker 4>all around the world.</v>

1754
01:25:50.471 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 4>And he had the gift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had the gift of language.</v>

1755
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:58.410
<v Speaker 4>He spoke in a such a compelling way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love listening to parents.</v>

1756
01:25:58.450 --> 01:25:59.380
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Hicks,</v>

1757
01:25:59.381 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the two of them together,</v>

1758
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:06.390
<v Speaker 4>just amazed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Hicks was a huge fan of Mckenna and </v>

1759
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 4>became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out about Mckenna because of him</v>

1760
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 4>because there was a joke where I'm Hicks</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1761
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:14.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about leaving mushrooms under </v>

1762
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.590
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1763
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:18.460
<v Speaker 4>under the table of all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it and it he said what Terence </v>

1764
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna would describe as a heroic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember saying who the fuck is </v>

1765
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.131
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then I wasn't even a google back </v>

1766
01:26:27.131 --> 01:26:27.131
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

1767
01:26:27.131 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I searched Terence Mckenna because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing about it on Bill Hicks.</v>

1768
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:31.980
<v Speaker 4>And then I got ahold of some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1769
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:37.450
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>audio recordings and then you listened </v>

1770
01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:37.730
<v Speaker 4>to the guy's voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1771
01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a weird guy,</v>

1772
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird,</v>

1773
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:42.620
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compelling way of communicating credible</v>

1774
01:26:42.621 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 4>use of language a which just makes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think all the,</v>

1775
01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.760
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the service he's providing for </v>

1776
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:51.760
<v Speaker 4>all of us still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he missed the mark on that December 21st</v>

1778
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:56.650
<v Speaker 4>2012 showed everybody did at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's got to miss the mark.</v>

1779
01:26:57.290 --> 01:27:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Guy Used to get high a lot and come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the cool theories and things to </v>

1780
01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 4>think about and when you're postulating </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thinking about the future.</v>

1781
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing about thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future.</v>

1782
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:08.710
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1783
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever figured out the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a single fucking person ever</v>

1784
01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:13.760
<v Speaker 4>sat down anybody to get it right.</v>

1785
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Nobody got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The future is.</v>

1786
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:18.440
<v Speaker 4>The future is indeterminate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1788
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:25.120
<v Speaker 4>talking about psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what's happening with cannabis in </v>

1789
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.560
<v Speaker 4>the United States right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is very,</v>

1790
01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:30.520
<v Speaker 4>is very interesting to me coming from </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming from Britain where you know,</v>

1791
01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 4>nobody has ever even willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemplate the legalization or the </v>

1792
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 4>direct striction of cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in America state by state,</v>

1793
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:42.530
<v Speaker 4>people are voting with their feet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the barriers of being,</v>

1794
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:43.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being broken down.</v>

1795
01:27:43.431 --> 01:27:48.431
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>America has been the huge dark force </v>

1796
01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:50.270
<v Speaker 4>behind the war on drugs all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world for the last 40 or 50 years.</v>

1797
01:27:50.271 --> 01:27:53.900
<v Speaker 4>So many countries around the world have </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blindly followed the American lead.</v>

1798
01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:56.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the American government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the American power structure.</v>

1799
01:27:56.451 --> 01:27:59.240
<v Speaker 4>But the American people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1800
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.540
<v Speaker 4>the American people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually we want to smoke cannabis and </v>

1801
01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 4>we find it positive and nurturing for us</v>
<v Speaker 4>and state by state,</v>

1802
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:13.060
<v Speaker 4>either it's being decriminalized or </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical Mariajuana is available or it's </v>

1803
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:16.010
<v Speaker 4>actually being legalized in a number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cases.</v>

1804
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:18.200
<v Speaker 4>This is a big change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1805
01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:23.201
<v Speaker 4>there's all kinds of conspiracy theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how Monsanto's going to take it </v>

1806
01:28:23.201 --> 01:28:24.560
<v Speaker 4>over and so on and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I see it as a really good thing that</v>

1807
01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:29.561
<v Speaker 4>these barriers in the heartland of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>war of drugs are being broken down by </v>

1808
01:28:29.561 --> 01:28:33.140
<v Speaker 4>the American people themselves and I say</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kudos to the American people for getting</v>

1809
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:38.141
<v Speaker 4>on and making that happen because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a benefit to the whole </v>

1810
01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:38.141
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Warren Buffet is starting to get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the marijuana trade.</v>

1812
01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when things are going to get </v>

1813
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:44.460
<v Speaker 4>freaky because then you got a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>worth $90,</v>

1814
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 4>million dollars or whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's worth.</v>

1815
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>That's when things can get very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1816
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:48.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1817
01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:53.771
<v Speaker 4>I mean people are going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are going to make commercial </v>

1818
01:28:53.771 --> 01:28:56.561
<v Speaker 4>advantage of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day I just come </v>

1819
01:28:56.561 --> 01:28:59.351
<v Speaker 4>back to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that I've said again </v>

1820
01:28:59.351 --> 01:28:59.351
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the years have gone have gone by,</v>

1821
01:28:59.351 --> 01:29:02.921
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fundamental issue is the right of </v>

1822
01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:02.921
<v Speaker 4>the adult</v>

1823
01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:07.550
<v Speaker 3>to make sovereign decisions about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness and one of those </v>

1824
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:11.010
<v Speaker 3>sovereign decisions has to be the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use cannabis or not to use it,</v>

1825
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.040
<v Speaker 3>but one must be free to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision and not and not controlled by </v>

1826
01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.941
<v Speaker 3>society and once that is recognized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once all the scare stories about </v>

1827
01:29:19.941 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 3>cannabis go away and we find that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact state by state,</v>

1828
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:28.910
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a positive rather than a harmful </v>

1829
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:31.761
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the question marks are </v>

1830
01:29:31.761 --> 01:29:33.150
<v Speaker 3>going to begin to arise over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics to and and we're going to.</v>

1831
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 3>We're going to see all those barriers </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking down in the years to come.</v>

1832
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1833
01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I think the bringing up Warren Buffett </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Warren Buffet's company specifically</v>

1834
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.980
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is he's a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

1835
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He says its subsidiary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary,</v>

1836
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary of Berkshire hathaway has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this company called cubic designs and </v>

1837
01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.760
<v Speaker 1>they sell the maximize usable floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>space in warehouses and they sent a </v>

1838
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:07.220
<v Speaker 1>thousand flyers to weed dispensary's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent weeks and these flyers,</v>

1839
01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:12.730
<v Speaker 1>they show these medical marijuana grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>ops and it's like double your users </v>

1840
01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking like,</v>

1841
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>this is intense stuff because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that are real estate holders </v>

1842
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 1>that have giant amounts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1843
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money invested in this that are </v>

1844
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1845
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to dip our feet into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is growing marijuana industry.</v>

1846
01:30:28.501 --> 01:30:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1847
01:30:28.911 --> 01:30:33.911
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who works at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispensary in Colorado and the </v>

1848
01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:36.980
<v Speaker 1>dispensary is five acres indoor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1849
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Five acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1850
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Five acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an enormous building and it's all</v>

1851
01:30:43.311 --> 01:30:43.760
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>

1852
01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just millions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and there's people that are </v>

1853
01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has only been less than a year.</v>

1854
01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was made legal last January </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here we are.</v>

1855
01:30:53.361 --> 01:30:56.090
<v Speaker 1>We're talking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is September of 2014.</v>

1856
01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did my comedy special in Denver </v>

1857
01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and I hadn't been at Denver and while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the places changed and it's like </v>

1858
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.990
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is a huge part of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1859
01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:11.330
<v Speaker 1>People are moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's marijuana tourism,</v>

1860
01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:14.210
<v Speaker 1>people are moving there for marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're moving there to be a part of the</v>

1861
01:31:14.211 --> 01:31:19.211
<v Speaker 1>marijuana business because you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking rich right now because </v>

1862
01:31:19.211 --> 01:31:23.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure what's gonna Happen federally </v>

1863
01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.991
<v Speaker 1>because it's still illegal federally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not sure whether or not they </v>

1864
01:31:25.991 --> 01:31:29.741
<v Speaker 1>want to dive into it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that are bold that are </v>

1865
01:31:29.741 --> 01:31:32.680
<v Speaker 1>willing to take a risk or making insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits a chance of making a sheehan </v>

1866
01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.120
<v Speaker 1>from it and the government is making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money to 39 percent of the </v>

1867
01:31:37.251 --> 01:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>profits go to taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1868
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So every marijuana joint that's gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold 39.</v>

1869
01:31:41.991 --> 01:31:44.540
<v Speaker 1>If it's sold for a dollar thirty nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents,</v>

1870
01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.090
<v Speaker 1>no one's selling for a dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's sold for $100,</v>

1871
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:52.130
<v Speaker 1>$39 is going to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're making over $100,000,000</v>

1872
01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:54.500
<v Speaker 1>this year in taxes just in Colorado.</v>

1873
01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>State government.</v>

1874
01:31:55.701 --> 01:32:00.701
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they're looking at this by the </v>

1875
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:00.701
<v Speaker 3>federal government is not reaping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>revenues.</v>

1876
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:00.701
<v Speaker 3>It's no</v>

1877
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 4>because it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's illegal,</v>

1878
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 4>but they're finally allowing the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>to put their money in banks,</v>

1879
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:10.500
<v Speaker 4>which was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had to do this weird shit where </v>

1880
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 4>they had to like put it in safe deposit </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxes or they had to buy,</v>

1881
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:17.040
<v Speaker 4>take the cash and then use it to buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>bank notes and the like by bank checks,</v>

1882
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 4>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't allowing them to use credit</v>

1883
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:25.831
<v Speaker 4>cards or any of the normal ways that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people do business that keep them from </v>

1884
01:32:25.831 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 4>being robbed at gunpoint by criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>untrackable bills,</v>

1885
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:34.020
<v Speaker 4>so they had these kids that were driving</v>
<v Speaker 4>around with stacks of cash is really </v>

1886
01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and scary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous and scary,</v>

1887
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:40.861
<v Speaker 4>but it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very good that the goal of this is </v>

1888
01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:40.861
<v Speaker 4>changing and I can only see it as a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1889
01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't see any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see any downside in it.</v>

1890
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:47.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really positive development that's </v>

1891
01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:47.820
<v Speaker 4>taking this taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>

1892
01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:51.900
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's also a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole movement that you and I were </v>

1893
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 4>talking about where the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing,</v>

1894
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:57.510
<v Speaker 4>information is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are just not prepared to put up </v>

1895
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:59.530
<v Speaker 4>with that fucking shit and he longer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not prepared to put up with it,</v>

1896
01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 4>to be told what to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be told what to do with their own,</v>

1897
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:07.890
<v Speaker 4>with their own consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's great that that it's Americans </v>

1898
01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:12.600
<v Speaker 4>who are leading the way in this and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the rest of the world is watching </v>

1899
01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.380
<v Speaker 4>and all the lies we've been told about </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis,</v>

1900
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:19.650
<v Speaker 4>they're going to just drift away and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrecked and destroyed forever by what's </v>

1901
01:33:19.650 --> 01:33:21.730
<v Speaker 4>happening in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a great service that's being,</v>

1902
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 4>that's being done to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you know,</v>

1903
01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I had my own longterm relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannabis.</v>

1904
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:29.470
<v Speaker 4>I smoked cannabis for 24 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I overindulged.</v>

1905
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:32.890
<v Speaker 4>I undoubtedly abused my relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>with cannabis.</v>

1906
01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't blame the cannabis for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was me.</v>

1907
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.990
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was crazy.</v>

1908
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little crazy.</v>

1909
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very crazy to,</v>

1910
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.880
<v Speaker 4>to smoke it from nine in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 4>until 2:00</v>

1911
01:33:42.881 --> 01:33:47.881
<v Speaker 4>the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven days a week of rather vaporize it </v>

1912
01:33:47.881 --> 01:33:49.150
<v Speaker 4>as I as I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I reached a point thanks to a series</v>

1913
01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:54.151
<v Speaker 4>of Iowasca journeys in October 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I made the decision that I </v>

1914
01:33:54.151 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't smoke cannabis and it's three </v>
<v Speaker 4>years have come since then,</v>

1915
01:33:56.861 --> 01:34:01.861
<v Speaker 4>but I want to live in a society where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fellow adults are free to choose </v>

1916
01:34:01.861 --> 01:34:06.840
<v Speaker 4>either to use cannabis or not to use it </v>
<v Speaker 4>without any state agent sticking their </v>

1917
01:34:08.081 --> 01:34:10.660
<v Speaker 4>nose in our private business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1918
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:15.661
<v Speaker 4>this is our private business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we do with our own consciousness </v>

1919
01:34:15.661 --> 01:34:19.660
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's incredibly encouraging to see </v>

1920
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.701
<v Speaker 4>that the Americans are taking that power</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and showing the rest of the world </v>

1921
01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:23.701
<v Speaker 4>how to do it.</v>

1922
01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:24.360
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1923
01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.780
<v Speaker 4>antipop doctors are being exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating.</v>

1924
01:34:28.781 --> 01:34:32.100
<v Speaker 4>All these doctors that are paid off by </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

1925
01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.320
<v Speaker 4>There was an article recently about pot </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctors being paid off and all of the </v>

1926
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:40.900
<v Speaker 4>leading pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like antipop doctors,</v>

1927
01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:43.300
<v Speaker 4>all of them taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1928
01:34:43.301 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 4>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I not surprised?</v>

1929
01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting that guys like Sanjay </v>

1930
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Gupta who used to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to be on board with that now has</v>

1931
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 4>come out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out in a huge way and he's also </v>

1932
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 4>starting to address psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to address what's going on with</v>

1933
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 4>psilocybin</v>

1934
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and there's the new study that's shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that took psilocybin and </v>

1935
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 1>quit smoking six months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of them,</v>

1936
01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:05.660
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some large number,</v>

1937
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.320
<v Speaker 1>70 or 80 percent quit smoking and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to it.</v>

1938
01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:14.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of just the clarity of those </v>

1939
01:35:14.321 --> 01:35:18.461
<v Speaker 1>visions where you kind of understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what am I doing to get that </v>

1940
01:35:18.461 --> 01:35:18.970
<v Speaker 1>perspective on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on yourself here and that's,</v>

1941
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big news.</v>

1942
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:25.811
<v Speaker 1>You know that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these things are positive and </v>

1943
01:35:25.811 --> 01:35:28.780
<v Speaker 1>beneficial and the way forward for </v>
<v Speaker 1>society is to create a positive social </v>

1944
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:34.931
<v Speaker 1>environment and positive spaces in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we can explore these </v>

1945
01:35:34.931 --> 01:35:38.381
<v Speaker 1>experiences and the result for society </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole will be very positive and </v>

1946
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:43.631
<v Speaker 1>very convinced of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vice Dot com is the guy who broke the </v>

1947
01:35:43.631 --> 01:35:47.921
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible and it's all these </v>

1948
01:35:47.921 --> 01:35:51.551
<v Speaker 1>different doctors that have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one Dr Herbert Keebler of a club </v>

1949
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 1>or clever of Columbia University.</v>

1950
01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He's been impeccable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Academic credentials has been quoted in </v>

1951
01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.620
<v Speaker 1>the press and academic publications </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning against the use of marijuana,</v>

1952
01:36:03.621 --> 01:36:06.620
<v Speaker 1>which he stresses may cause wide ranging</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

1953
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:11.770
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite wide ranging </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction and public health issues when </v>

1954
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:14.060
<v Speaker 1>he's writing his antipop opinion pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>for CBS News.</v>

1955
01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.300
<v Speaker 1>CBS News are being quoted by NBR and </v>
<v Speaker 1>CNBC.</v>

1956
01:36:17.301 --> 01:36:22.301
<v Speaker 1>What's left unsaid is that clever has </v>
<v Speaker 1>served as a paid consultant to leading </v>

1957
01:36:22.301 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 1>prescription drug companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including purdue Pharma,</v>

1958
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the maker of Oxycontin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reckitt Bank bank,</v>

1959
01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the producer of painkiller called </v>

1960
01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.851
<v Speaker 1>neurofen and out comers Alker Mez the </v>
<v Speaker 1>producer of a powerful new opiod called </v>

1961
01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Z o h,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why dro?</v>

1962
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:46.910
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zohydro Zohydro,</v>

1963
01:36:46.911 --> 01:36:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you say is what?</v>

1964
01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.350
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1965
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.080
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1966
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.630
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1967
01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:57.500
<v Speaker 1>what he's been hiding and covering up is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all this stuff he's pushing.</v>

1968
01:36:57.501 --> 01:37:01.340
<v Speaker 1>That's the real addictive drugs will pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1969
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:02.240
<v Speaker 1>deaths a year.</v>

1970
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a multi billion dollar business </v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes 16 deaths a year.</v>

1971
01:37:06.351 --> 01:37:11.351
<v Speaker 1>Just in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sixteen thousand sixteen thousand </v>

1972
01:37:11.351 --> 01:37:14.711
<v Speaker 1>deaths a year stunning and a doctors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the take to keep promoting that and </v>

1973
01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 1>to stop us exercising our free choice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults to manage our pain in other ways.</v>

1974
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cannabis,</v>

1975
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and even if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just 16 desk.</v>

1976
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1977
01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen thousand 16 desks that 16 more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than cannabis causing zero.</v>

1978
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis doesn't kill any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most ridiculous thing ever.</v>

1979
01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:37.721
<v Speaker 1>Like you could die from aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people die every year from </v>

1980
01:37:37.721 --> 01:37:37.721
<v Speaker 1>aspirin and a lot of people die every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year from salt.</v>

1981
01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Too much salt and they die absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink too.</v>

1982
01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.470
<v Speaker 1>We have a painkiller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd call it a set,</v>

1983
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 1>a set to a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1984
01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.850
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it paracetamol in in England and</v>

1985
01:37:46.851 --> 01:37:47.900
<v Speaker 1>had reflux.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You liver.</v>

1986
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1987
01:37:48.771 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous thing and,</v>

1988
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once it reaches a certain level,</v>

1989
01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:55.220
<v Speaker 1>there is no recovery from it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills thousands.</v>

1990
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people.</v>

1991
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:01.100
<v Speaker 3>A year while I was reading this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about bodybuilder or watching a video </v>

1992
01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:04.041
<v Speaker 3>rather about bodybuilding and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>was being interviewed who used to be </v>

1993
01:38:04.041 --> 01:38:08.001
<v Speaker 3>this big competitive bodybuilder and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking to all the drugs that </v>

1994
01:38:08.001 --> 01:38:11.330
<v Speaker 3>you have to take to get so big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things you were talking </v>

1995
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:13.440
<v Speaker 3>about was that what really kills these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys is not the steroids.</v>

1996
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 3>It's painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1997
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They all get hooked on painkillers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're in pain all the time </v>

1998
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.611
<v Speaker 3>because they're lifting all this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight and fuck fucking up their body </v>

1999
01:38:22.611 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 3>while they're doing it and they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>Acetaminophen.</v>

2000
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 3>All these different values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>percosets and that stuff.</v>

2001
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:30.050
<v Speaker 3>It just destroys their kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Destroys your liver.</v>

2002
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.800
<v Speaker 3>It's withdrawal symptom from stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taking the painkiller is huge amount of </v>

2004
01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you then go and take more,</v>

2005
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 3>more painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are highly,</v>

2006
01:38:39.450 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 3>highly addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly,</v>

2007
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 3>highly dangerous drugs.</v>

2008
01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and state sanctioned.</v>

2009
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>

2010
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.860
<v Speaker 3>totally state show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm wondering now,</v>

2011
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:54.861
<v Speaker 3>three years after I gave up cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether back in dip my toes back in the </v>

2012
01:38:55.351 --> 01:38:59.100
<v Speaker 3>water in there in a respectful way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2013
01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:01.920
<v Speaker 3>not do it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some sacred moments.</v>

2014
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I value the sensual side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2015
01:39:04.891 --> 01:39:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2016
01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm the next time I have an eyewash </v>
<v Speaker 3>station I'm going to,</v>

2017
01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask a Iowasca is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be my intent because that was Iowasca </v>

2018
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:14.270
<v Speaker 3>that really interrupted by cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 3>habit.</v>

2019
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a way I can do this?</v>

2020
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's weak of me.</v>

2021
01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I've wondered this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2022
01:39:19.681 --> 01:39:24.681
<v Speaker 3>I was talking with a friend last night </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said there is a true addict </v>

2023
01:39:24.681 --> 01:39:24.681
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2024
01:39:24.681 --> 01:39:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I said this because it sounds a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds a bit like that,</v>

2025
01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:28.140
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did volume cannabis.</v>

2026
01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:33.140
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an extraordinary positive thing </v>

2027
01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:33.140
<v Speaker 3>for me in many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many ways.</v>

2028
01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.200
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2029
01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.050
<v Speaker 3>What I feel is that I got out of balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and if I could,</v>

2030
01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.560
<v Speaker 3>if I could find that balance again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>use it rarely at special times,</v>

2031
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:44.250
<v Speaker 3>then I think it would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm,</v>

2032
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2033
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little afraid to go back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2034
01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:47.950
<v Speaker 3>you should be afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2035
01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've had personal experience </v>

2036
01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.071
<v Speaker 3>with addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that addiction is purely </v>

2037
01:39:55.071 --> 01:39:57.351
<v Speaker 3>mental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's purely metal because it was very </v>

2038
01:39:57.351 --> 01:39:59.511
<v Speaker 3>easy to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once Iowasca gave me the message and I </v>

2039
01:39:59.511 --> 01:39:59.511
<v Speaker 3>really got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2040
01:39:59.511 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I had a severe kicking first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a DMT trip.</v>

2041
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Then immediately afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five Iowasca sessions I was,</v>

2042
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I was psychologically beaten up and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message of that beating was you have to </v>

2043
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 3>stop smoking cannabis and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2044
01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I did.</v>

2045
01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 3>And looking back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absurd to,</v>

2046
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 3>this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful a plant agent.</v>

2047
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:20.700
<v Speaker 3>And here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2048
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:25.410
<v Speaker 3>vaporizing it 16 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven days a week.</v>

2049
01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.510
<v Speaker 3>You went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went deep.</v>

2050
01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:28.100
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

2051
01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went very deep.</v>

2052
01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:29.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2053
01:40:29.681 --> 01:40:30.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2054
01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:35.180
<v Speaker 3>and it got to the point where I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying it anymore where I just felt </v>

2055
01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.451
<v Speaker 3>that I couldn't live my life without it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I discovered I easily could live my </v>

2056
01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 3>life without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I stopped,</v>

2057
01:40:39.691 --> 01:40:41.700
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a huge chore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem to stop.</v>

2058
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:46.701
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't actually difficult and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sense I would definitely was not </v>

2059
01:40:46.701 --> 01:40:48.410
<v Speaker 3>physically addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2060
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:53.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is that I think there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people that do get physically </v>

2061
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>addicted.</v>

2062
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2063
01:40:55.780 --> 01:41:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to say marijuana is not addictive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it is with most </v>

2064
01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:04.711
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think biological diversity of </v>

2065
01:41:04.711 --> 01:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity in human beings is such </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's certain folks that have </v>

2066
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 1>weird reactions to all kinds of shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things.</v>

2067
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:16.051
<v Speaker 1>Cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people around cats like my friend </v>

2068
01:41:16.051 --> 01:41:16.051
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't even come over my house because</v>

2069
01:41:16.051 --> 01:41:20.671
<v Speaker 1>I have two cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he walks in the door he was </v>

2070
01:41:20.671 --> 01:41:20.671
<v Speaker 1>targeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets as wheezing.</v>

2071
01:41:20.671 --> 01:41:22.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he has to get out of there.</v>

2072
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They kill him with a room of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I got my friend Joey Diaz who </v>

2073
01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is y'all 11?</v>

2074
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he has 11 cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so motherfucker has 11 credits.</v>

2075
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you.</v>

2076
01:41:33.090 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>If my friend Gary went over my friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>show his house,</v>

2077
01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:36.500
<v Speaker 1>he would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would die.</v>

2078
01:41:36.501 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Joey's having a party over there.</v>

2079
01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:40.530
<v Speaker 1>He's got cats on his lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pet numb.</v>

2080
01:41:40.531 --> 01:41:43.120
<v Speaker 1>They're sitting on his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all.</v>

2081
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.700
<v Speaker 1>We're all different than what works for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one person,</v>

2082
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:47.470
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work for another,</v>

2083
01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:48.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2084
01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:54.420
<v Speaker 1>why this issue of adult sovereignty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us having the right to make our choices </v>

2085
01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:58.411
<v Speaker 1>about our own bodies is fundamental and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually with the psychedelics and </v>

2086
01:41:58.411 --> 01:42:02.851
<v Speaker 1>the cannabis issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the tip of the iceberg of </v>

2087
01:42:02.851 --> 01:42:05.431
<v Speaker 1>the whole issue of health and personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and how our society is working to</v>

2088
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:10.861
<v Speaker 1>take away our choices over our personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and to turn us into robots who </v>

2089
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:16.830
<v Speaker 1>consume the products that are pumped at </v>
<v Speaker 1>us by the big pharmaceutical companies </v>

2090
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:21.571
<v Speaker 1>or who are inventing every year this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unholy alliance with psychiatrists and </v>

2091
01:42:21.571 --> 01:42:26.401
<v Speaker 1>venting every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New mental conditions for which new </v>

2092
01:42:26.401 --> 01:42:27.130
<v Speaker 1>pills will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will be dosed out.</v>

2093
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In England,</v>

2094
01:42:28.091 --> 01:42:30.070
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have those commercials </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2095
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Those commercials are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>insidious.</v>

2096
01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Ask Your doctor about this drug that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might cause you to shit yourself all day</v>

2097
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commit suicide,</v>

2098
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:44.700
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big untold story about </v>

2099
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.581
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidepressants caused people to </v>

2100
01:42:47.581 --> 01:42:50.101
<v Speaker 1>kill themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about antidepressants that </v>

2101
01:42:50.101 --> 01:42:52.441
<v Speaker 1>supplement the antidepressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants like there's certain </v>

2102
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:54.250
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was called.</v>

2103
01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:59.251
<v Speaker 1>It had insane side effects that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were promoting as a supplement to your </v>

2104
01:42:59.561 --> 01:43:04.561
<v Speaker 1>regular antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regular antidepressants isn't doing it </v>

2105
01:43:04.561 --> 01:43:08.251
<v Speaker 1>until you sit up with this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one could cause fucking kidney </v>

2106
01:43:08.251 --> 01:43:08.980
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Dick might fly across the room like</v>

2107
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 1>a mocking bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think anything could happen to</v>

2108
01:43:12.101 --> 01:43:17.101
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might not be depressed or you </v>

2109
01:43:17.101 --> 01:43:17.101
<v Speaker 1>might just take our pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These other doctors,</v>

2110
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 1>drug dealers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the true matthew of drugs.</v>

2111
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the idea of commercials.</v>

2112
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Commercials are influential and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of commercials is very </v>

2113
01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.861
<v Speaker 1>insidious because there's one thing if a</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial is influencing you to buy a </v>

2114
01:43:31.861 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>particular vacuum cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't bother me man.</v>

2115
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the best it look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

2116
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're too much of a knucklehead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and consumer reports or you know,</v>

2117
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:43.830
<v Speaker 1>go to read reviews online by independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that tell you this vacuum cleaner</v>

2118
01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 1>is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vacuum cleaner sucks.</v>

2119
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're too much of a knucklehead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

2120
01:43:47.711 --> 01:43:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel bad for the executive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to consciousness,</v>

2121
01:43:50.561 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to pills,</v>

2122
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:53.990
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2123
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 4>because that's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Antidepressants,</v>

2124
01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.830
<v Speaker 4>they should we call them happy pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2125
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:01.370
<v Speaker 4>I wrote an article a long time ago from </v>
<v Speaker 4>my blog about happy pills.</v>

2126
01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I called it happy pills and it was about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2127
01:44:03.981 --> 01:44:04.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2128
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.960
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2129
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.470
<v Speaker 4>this girl who was taking these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2130
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:13.550
<v Speaker 4>these antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the selling of </v>

2131
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 4>happiness in pill form is the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous American notion.</v>

2132
01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible.</v>

2133
01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2134
01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2135
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:24.140
<v Speaker 4>it's suggesting that the onset does not </v>
<v Speaker 4>lie within that,</v>

2136
01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 4>that it can be bought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happiness can be bold.</v>

2137
01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:32.440
<v Speaker 4>But I think that the ultimate delusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>also what's insidious about it is </v>

2138
01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:36.400
<v Speaker 4>selling it on television like that does </v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge disservice to the actual people </v>

2139
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.860
<v Speaker 4>that could use antidepressants because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a real mental imbalance.</v>

2140
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:41.540
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that do do that.</v>

2141
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:46.750
<v Speaker 4>So like you're selling it as an antidote</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a shit life where there's other </v>

2142
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:48.890
<v Speaker 4>folks that might have a real issue.</v>

2143
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:53.970
<v Speaker 4>They have an imbalanced huge chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>imbalance in the brain and that can be </v>

2144
01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 4>adjusted and adjusted and make their </v>
<v Speaker 4>life wonderful.</v>

2145
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 4>People that have a miserable life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can make their life wonderful,</v>

2146
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:03.790
<v Speaker 4>but instead were people will trivialize </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because you see a commercial or a </v>

2147
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:07.840
<v Speaker 4>chicken running around a field of wheat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and spinning around with her baby and </v>

2148
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.330
<v Speaker 4>then someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to live like that.</v>

2149
01:45:08.331 --> 01:45:10.430
<v Speaker 4>And then they called her a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor and next thing you know,</v>

2150
01:45:10.431 --> 01:45:15.431
<v Speaker 4>you're on a pill that you didn't need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just start eating vegetables and </v>

2151
01:45:15.431 --> 01:45:18.011
<v Speaker 4>going jogging every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be way happier person than you </v>

2152
01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:18.011
<v Speaker 4>were on that pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

2153
01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me say right,</v>

2154
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I outright that the psychedelics are </v>
<v Speaker 4>very effective antidepressants.</v>

2155
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Psilocybin being trial tested in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>communities for thousands and thousands </v>

2156
01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.260
<v Speaker 4>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iowaska and the Amazon,</v>

2157
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.300
<v Speaker 4>at least 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years of use,</v>

2158
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 4>and anybody who's worked with psilocybin</v>
<v Speaker 4>or or IOWASCA enough,</v>

2159
01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:39.140
<v Speaker 4>we'll know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they do help with mood,</v>

2160
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.200
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do help you take a more positive </v>

2161
01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.690
<v Speaker 4>outlook on outlook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on life and and whether that's to do </v>

2162
01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:50.441
<v Speaker 4>with altering the chemical balance in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain because they do work on the </v>

2163
01:45:50.441 --> 01:45:54.521
<v Speaker 4>serotonin system in the brain chemically</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whether it's to do with the </v>

2164
01:45:54.521 --> 01:45:58.631
<v Speaker 4>revelation that one has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that life is an incredible gift and </v>

2165
01:45:58.631 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 4>incredible joy and a privilege to be to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be alive.</v>

2166
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what we forget,</v>

2167
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.490
<v Speaker 4>immersed in the cares and woes of daily </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2168
01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:08.900
<v Speaker 4>constantly struggling to meet the next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to pay the bills,</v>

2169
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:13.950
<v Speaker 4>to to get on in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in work would relentlessly driven to </v>

2170
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:17.150
<v Speaker 4>produce and consume and we forget that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a magical,</v>

2171
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.760
<v Speaker 4>enchanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gorgeous,</v>

2172
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:24.790
<v Speaker 4>glorious universe that we live in and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this amazing bodies and we should </v>

2173
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:26.690
<v Speaker 4>just celebrate every minute of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics help with that too.</v>

2174
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

2175
01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:29.630
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to keep a balanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>

2176
01:46:29.631 --> 01:46:34.631
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also important to realize </v>

2177
01:46:34.631 --> 01:46:36.881
<v Speaker 4>that perspective shifting consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shifting experiences can also change the</v>

2178
01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:41.750
<v Speaker 4>way you look at the world and when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>change the way you look at the world,</v>

2179
01:46:41.751 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 4>it can adjust the way your brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>functions and that it's not an either or</v>

2180
01:46:46.341 --> 01:46:48.620
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Kombucha Tory situation.</v>

2181
01:46:48.621 --> 01:46:53.621
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might affect your brain in a very </v>

2182
01:46:53.621 --> 01:46:56.181
<v Speaker 4>chemical way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also just the altering of a </v>

2183
01:46:56.181 --> 01:46:58.551
<v Speaker 4>perspective could enhance your mood and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it can enhance the way your body and </v>

2184
01:46:58.551 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 4>brain function because the mind is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we are.</v>

2185
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:04.110
<v Speaker 4>We are our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mind is the most powerful,</v>

2186
01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:07.170
<v Speaker 4>the most powerful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where all healing,</v>

2187
01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I believe resides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It resides.</v>

2188
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:12.180
<v Speaker 4>It resides in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can kick in the body's ability to</v>

2189
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:15.600
<v Speaker 4>heal itself through right mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>attitude,</v>

2190
01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.790
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no medicine will do that for you,</v>

2191
01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.330
<v Speaker 4>and that's why placebos actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2192
01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:25.580
<v Speaker 4>That's why they worked better than than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the prescription drugs that had been </v>

2193
01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:25.580
<v Speaker 4>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2194
01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 4>they don't work better than prescription</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

2195
01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:30.060
<v Speaker 4>but occasionally they do do just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that they work at all.</v>

2196
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 4>The placebo effect is not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective as medicine,</v>

2197
01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.100
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in most cases,</v>

2198
01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.620
<v Speaker 4>but just the fact that it does work at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2199
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:42.740
<v Speaker 4>that there's a way that you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body to make itself better and the </v>

2200
01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 4>way is by tricking it to thinking as </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking medicine.</v>

2201
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be better.</v>

2202
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The alleviation of stress and </v>

2203
01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 4>anticipation of this horrible demise </v>
<v Speaker 4>that your impending doom that you can </v>

2204
01:47:54.511 --> 01:47:57.450
<v Speaker 4>escape with a sugar pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2205
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.850
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says something about the mind set and</v>

2206
01:47:59.851 --> 01:48:04.851
<v Speaker 4>it's something really worth looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that further that is enhanced in </v>

2207
01:48:04.851 --> 01:48:08.841
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perspective enhancing aspects of that I </v>

2208
01:48:08.841 --> 01:48:10.710
<v Speaker 4>do believe can change your overall </v>
<v Speaker 4>health or change overall consciousness,</v>

2209
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.500
<v Speaker 4>which can change your overall health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on man,</v>

2211
01:48:14.341 --> 01:48:19.341
<v Speaker 4>and I think these conversations are </v>
<v Speaker 4>super important for people that are </v>

2212
01:48:19.341 --> 01:48:20.840
<v Speaker 4>uninitiated and that haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand what the.</v>

2213
01:48:21.010 --> 01:48:26.010
<v Speaker 4>What's the Hoopla about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is everybody got down with that </v>

2214
01:48:26.010 --> 01:48:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Rogan's going on about drugs again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I.</v>

2215
01:48:26.010 --> 01:48:30.891
<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a constituency of my readers and </v>

2216
01:48:30.891 --> 01:48:35.480
<v Speaker 4>people who follow me on facebook who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly throwing handcuffs or a </v>

2217
01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.000
<v Speaker 4>druggie and pass at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just feel this is really </v>

2218
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

2219
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:44.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a really important conversation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and fundamentally get right down to</v>

2220
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about this whole issue of us taking</v>

2221
01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:53.421
<v Speaker 4>back power over ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's really about and the </v>

2222
01:48:53.421 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 4>and it needs to be seen in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that context,</v>

2223
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:58.560
<v Speaker 4>to make decisions about our own lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right or wrong,</v>

2224
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:02.250
<v Speaker 4>and to learn from our mistakes and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow and develop as a result.</v>

2225
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:07.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also super important that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you discussed your relationship with </v>

2226
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:10.080
<v Speaker 4>cannabis in an abusive way too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a balance to be achieved.</v>

2227
01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a balance to be achieved for all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of us.</v>

2228
01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Sort of a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>

2229
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:15.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've learned in a way I.</v>

2230
01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.360
<v Speaker 4>I had to deny myself this wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense you'll plant,</v>

2231
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:26.820
<v Speaker 4>which helped me to enjoy food and music </v>
<v Speaker 4>and many other essential plays.</v>

2232
01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Sax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2233
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:30.740
<v Speaker 4>You've never had socks on pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2234
01:49:30.741 --> 01:49:35.741
<v Speaker 4>What you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what led Zepplin </v>

2235
01:49:35.741 --> 01:49:35.741
<v Speaker 4>sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2236
01:49:35.741 --> 01:49:37.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will ally,</v>

2237
01:49:37.290 --> 01:49:42.290
<v Speaker 4>and I've had to deny myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sends you an ally for the last </v>

2238
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 4>three years because I abused it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I might spark up a joint right now.</v>

2239
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Want</v>

2240
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.500
<v Speaker 3>to dive in right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course the jail.</v>

2241
01:49:50.501 --> 01:49:51.760
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like the,</v>

2242
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 3>the garden of didn't sure you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2243
01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

2244
01:49:58.781 --> 01:50:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to force you into anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

2245
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 3>You're not forcing me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting expand now.</v>

2246
01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2247
01:50:02.851 --> 01:50:03.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2248
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go.</v>

2249
01:50:04.450 --> 01:50:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go live on Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that bad?</v>

2250
01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not bad.</v>

2251
01:50:09.690 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to dive in,</v>

2252
01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.000
<v Speaker 3>we'll go a little baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit little baby.</v>

2253
01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Little Baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first baby hit in three years.</v>

2254
01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has to get hurt here.</v>

2255
01:50:19.450 --> 01:50:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were showing some images from </v>

2256
01:50:24.450 --> 01:50:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Lebanon before the POC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you gotten into?</v>

2257
01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by the time I smoked this little </v>

2258
01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:31.380
<v Speaker 3>baby hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2259
01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably have forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2260
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:37.380
<v Speaker 3>so what I was getting into was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:46.980
<v Speaker 3>That's not that crappy getting England </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's made by American scientists and </v>

2264
01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:50.431
<v Speaker 3>botanists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all drive muscle cars and they do </v>

2265
01:50:50.431 --> 01:50:50.431
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So familiar.</v>

2266
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.710
<v Speaker 3>That's such a nice feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2267
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:55.120
<v Speaker 3>that's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we,</v>

2268
01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:57.890
<v Speaker 3>are we seeing on the screen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

2269
01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 3>You're going in for another baby hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a little tiny.</v>

2270
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop right there.</v>

2271
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Right you to get confused on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2272
01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 3>We will see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is.</v>

2273
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the um,</v>

2274
01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.800
<v Speaker 3>this is what is called the stone of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant woman.</v>

2275
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fall back.</v>

2276
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the level on top of that is me on</v>
<v Speaker 3>top of that can be a power point </v>

2277
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.840
<v Speaker 3>demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we see it.</v>

2278
01:51:22.841 --> 01:51:23.800
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little,</v>

2279
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:27.730
<v Speaker 3>this little tiny dark up here on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2280
01:51:27.731 --> 01:51:31.810
<v Speaker 3>That's me in Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is this a recent in July?</v>

2281
01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there and I was there in July.</v>

2282
01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:37.750
<v Speaker 3>People say that Lebanon is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and this place is right on the</v>

2283
01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:42.751
<v Speaker 3>Syrian border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't see any danger there at </v>

2284
01:51:42.751 --> 01:51:42.751
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

2285
01:51:42.751 --> 01:51:42.880
<v Speaker 3>I had a magical experience in Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

2286
01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was for you,</v>

2287
01:51:44.441 --> 01:51:47.290
<v Speaker 3>it must be incredible because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sight of so many ancient,</v>

2288
01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:52.560
<v Speaker 3>huge monolithic structures that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexplained as far as our construction </v>

2289
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:56.281
<v Speaker 3>methods are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek in </v>

2290
01:51:56.281 --> 01:51:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Temple of Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what they call it.</v>

2291
01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's undoubtedly a Roman temple.</v>

2292
01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:03.721
<v Speaker 3>They're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that Roman temple dates from the </v>

2293
01:52:03.721 --> 01:52:04.600
<v Speaker 3>known historical periods some two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 years after Christ.</v>

2294
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 3>It's the Roman temple of Jupiter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very extraordinary,</v>

2295
01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:12.571
<v Speaker 3>but it stands on these huge foundations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a group of stones called three </v>

2296
01:52:13.421 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 3>stones called the tree lithium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

2297
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:20.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each weighing 840 tons,</v>

2298
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:23.110
<v Speaker 3>840 tons.</v>

2299
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they are lifted to 20 feet above the</v>

2300
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:29.920
<v Speaker 3>ground and built into a wall of sat on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of one of those stones.</v>

2301
01:52:29.921 --> 01:52:34.921
<v Speaker 3>I've been done underneath it and looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up at it to 840 ton stones.</v>

2302
01:52:35.230 --> 01:52:40.230
<v Speaker 3>This is this gigantic achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the Orthodox view is that the Romans</v>

2303
01:52:40.871 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 3>did everything that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they built those foundations and they,</v>

2304
01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:50.230
<v Speaker 3>the temple I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and many researchers who have studied </v>

2305
01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 3>them in this field would agree with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this,</v>

2306
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 3>that actually the Romans found a much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more ancient site and they,</v>

2307
01:52:55.160 --> 01:53:00.160
<v Speaker 3>which was just extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>megalithic gigantic stones and they </v>

2308
01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.691
<v Speaker 3>built their temple on top of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>later historians have simply given the </v>

2309
01:53:04.691 --> 01:53:06.650
<v Speaker 3>whole thing to the Romans without </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering,</v>

2310
01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was,</v>

2311
01:53:08.091 --> 01:53:13.091
<v Speaker 3>what was going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason I think that is </v>

2312
01:53:13.091 --> 01:53:13.091
<v Speaker 3>because of these stones that are still </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the quarry,</v>

2313
01:53:13.091 --> 01:53:13.670
<v Speaker 3>which I was trying to.</v>

2314
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it showed up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

2315
01:53:15.351 --> 01:53:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I was trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

2316
01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.390
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to show it,</v>

2317
01:53:17.391 --> 01:53:18.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to show it just now.</v>

2318
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.380
<v Speaker 3>These stones stood in the quarry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2319
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what the historians say is that the </v>

2320
01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2321
01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 3>They found they could move the 840 ton </v>
<v Speaker 3>stones.</v>

2322
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 3>That's 1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred and 80,000</v>

2323
01:53:32.841 --> 01:53:35.450
<v Speaker 3>pounds for people who don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word ton.</v>

2324
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:37.260
<v Speaker 3>You've got your calculator going back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2325
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Because it didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to double it,</v>

2326
01:53:39.891 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's not double.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's two pounds,</v>

2327
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.210
<v Speaker 3>2000 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a number.</v>

2328
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a CSM number is 6,000</v>

2329
01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.700
<v Speaker 3>pounds for every ton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was going eight to 2000 for each.</v>

2330
01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:54.750
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight hundred 40 times 2000.</v>

2331
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that's where it is.</v>

2332
01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a million.</v>

2333
01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:02.860
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the 840 ton blocks in the </v>

2334
01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:02.860
<v Speaker 3>walls in the foundation of the temple.</v>

2335
01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:07.840
<v Speaker 3>Then we go to the quarry and we find </v>
<v Speaker 3>this humongous thing which weighs over </v>

2336
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.491
<v Speaker 3>1000 tons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's another one on the other </v>

2337
01:54:12.491 --> 01:54:13.790
<v Speaker 3>side of the road which was 1,200</v>
<v Speaker 3>tubs.</v>

2338
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.820
<v Speaker 3>One thousand two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thousand two hundred thousand to 2 </v>

2339
01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred thousand pounds.</v>

2340
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a fuck.</v>

2341
01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 3>So here's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2342
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 3>The Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Romans found they could move the 840</v>

2343
01:54:26.601 --> 01:54:31.601
<v Speaker 3>ton blocks and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the orthodox theory and then </v>

2344
01:54:31.601 --> 01:54:35.741
<v Speaker 3>they built their temple on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they found they couldn't move these </v>

2345
01:54:35.741 --> 01:54:37.910
<v Speaker 3>thousand or 1,200</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus ton blocks,</v>

2346
01:54:37.911 --> 01:54:42.911
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one is completely separated from </v>

2347
01:54:42.911 --> 01:54:45.341
<v Speaker 3>the bedrock of which has been caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't move them so they left </v>

2348
01:54:45.341 --> 01:54:49.361
<v Speaker 3>them in the quarry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that actually proves that the </v>

2349
01:54:49.361 --> 01:54:53.171
<v Speaker 3>Romans didn't create the 840 ton </v>
<v Speaker 3>megaliths because if the Romans had </v>

2350
01:54:53.871 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 3>known that these gigantic blocks in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they had cut the blocks,</v>

2351
01:54:58.011 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they had cut them themselves,</v>

2352
01:54:59.841 --> 01:55:01.850
<v Speaker 3>which we must say they did.</v>

2353
01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 3>If we are saying that the Romans were </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for these mega list,</v>

2354
01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 3>if the Romans had cut these blocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2355
01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 3>they knew they were there and the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing they would have used for the</v>

2356
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:15.920
<v Speaker 3>smaller blocks that they put into place </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the temple of Jupiter was these large</v>

2357
01:55:15.921 --> 01:55:20.921
<v Speaker 3>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have sliced them up like a </v>

2358
01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:21.770
<v Speaker 3>loaf of bread into smaller blocks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>move those over to the temples.</v>

2359
01:55:21.771 --> 01:55:26.771
<v Speaker 3>The fact that these huge megaliths still</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing in the quarry suggest to me </v>

2360
01:55:26.771 --> 01:55:30.641
<v Speaker 3>that they were buried when the Romans </v>
<v Speaker 3>came to that site because otherwise it </v>

2361
01:55:30.641 --> 01:55:33.911
<v Speaker 3>would have been the very first thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have used for quarrying </v>

2362
01:55:33.911 --> 01:55:37.090
<v Speaker 3>smaller blocks that they were buried and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Romans found an existing </v>

2363
01:55:37.090 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 3>prehistoric megalithic platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on top of it they built their temple</v>

2364
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:42.920
<v Speaker 3>of Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating theory.</v>

2365
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2366
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 3>it seems like open to interpretation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2367
01:55:47.070 --> 01:55:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2368
01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're looking at.</v>

2369
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 3>But we'll either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2370
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.230
<v Speaker 3>regardless of why they built the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2371
01:55:55.231 --> 01:55:56.760
<v Speaker 3>1,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2372
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:58.710
<v Speaker 3>2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>400,000.</v>

2373
01:55:58.770 --> 01:56:00.960
<v Speaker 3>It freaky when you done in pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2374
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do it in tons,</v>

2375
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.770
<v Speaker 3>it's abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve hundred tons.</v>

2376
01:56:04.771 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2377
01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:07.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for my head.</v>

2378
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's consider,</v>

2379
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.620
<v Speaker 3>bless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consider an average vehicle which might.</v>

2380
01:56:10.621 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2381
01:56:11.191 --> 01:56:13.890
<v Speaker 3>let's push in pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's about two tons,</v>

2382
01:56:13.891 --> 01:56:18.891
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that about the weight of an average </v>

2383
01:56:18.891 --> 01:56:18.891
<v Speaker 3>vehicle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So two tons divide a thousand by that.</v>

2384
01:56:18.891 --> 01:56:22.290
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at 500 family sized </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars under a thousand,</v>

2385
01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.900
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons.</v>

2386
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the imagining a 2 million </v>

2387
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:35.121
<v Speaker 3>pound rock and a bunch of dudes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving it and we know that someone at </v>

2388
01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:39.810
<v Speaker 3>some time in history they built that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moved those stones.</v>

2389
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2390
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

2391
01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.010
<v Speaker 3>What was the first calculation that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had?</v>

2392
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:49.310
<v Speaker 3>What did we say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 640 times is that there's three </v>

2393
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.310
<v Speaker 3>blocks of 800,</v>
<v Speaker 3>84.</v>

2394
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I joined so closely that you can't slip </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sheet of paper between them.</v>

2395
01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:54.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've not been just roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave it into place.</v>

2396
01:56:54.061 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 3>They'd been set down with perfect with </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect precision.</v>

2397
01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.710
<v Speaker 3>So someone did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that.</v>

2398
01:56:59.711 --> 01:57:04.711
<v Speaker 3>What did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are plenty of people arguing </v>

2399
01:57:04.711 --> 01:57:07.071
<v Speaker 3>that the Romans did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel along along with other </v>

2400
01:57:07.071 --> 01:57:10.281
<v Speaker 3>researchers have approached this a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel I want to look at alternative </v>

2401
01:57:10.281 --> 01:57:13.371
<v Speaker 3>possibilities for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what these mega lists are all about </v>

2402
01:57:13.371 --> 01:57:15.891
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things I'd been </v>

2403
01:57:15.891 --> 01:57:15.891
<v Speaker 3>doing for the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is traveling around the world looking.</v>

2404
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I feel so lucky to have the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do this and just amazing,</v>

2405
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:26.570
<v Speaker 3>amazing archeological sites and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the countries that I visited and I want </v>

2406
01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:30.810
<v Speaker 3>to really mention this is Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2407
01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 3>where I have seen incredible stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles,</v>

2408
01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:40.400
<v Speaker 3>just wonderful dwarfs stonehenge make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make us just standing all and look at </v>

2409
01:57:43.741 --> 01:57:48.741
<v Speaker 3>the way that these huge megalithic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stones in what is called the moonstone </v>

2410
01:57:48.741 --> 01:57:48.741
<v Speaker 3>circle.</v>

2411
01:57:48.741 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 3>They have certain holes drilled in them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to align up with particular areas of the</v>

2412
01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:56.811
<v Speaker 3>sky at an Armenian Akio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Astronomer from that kind of data </v>

2413
01:57:57.421 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 3>believes that the place called </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

2414
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:02.610
<v Speaker 3>not just two or 3000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as most historians believe,</v>

2415
01:58:02.611 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 3>but well over 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2416
01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Why did you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of the astronomical alignments </v>

2417
01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:12.360
<v Speaker 3>that the positions of the stars in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky change very slowly down the ages.</v>

2418
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.720
<v Speaker 3>That the alignment to the solstices </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes because there's a slow nod on </v>

2419
01:58:18.001 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 3>the axis of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2420
01:58:19.351 --> 01:58:21.450
<v Speaker 3>very slow over tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2421
01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Which means that if the sun rises at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain point on the horizon,</v>

2422
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 3>on the summer solstice today in two or </v>
<v Speaker 3>three or 5,000</v>

2423
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:36.471
<v Speaker 3>years' time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point on the horizon will have </v>

2424
01:58:36.471 --> 01:58:36.471
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't notice it in a lifetime.</v>

2425
01:58:36.471 --> 01:58:38.970
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't notice it in 10 lifetimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you stay long enough,</v>

2426
01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:43.971
<v Speaker 3>you'll note that actually the sun isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>rising in the place on the horizon </v>

2427
01:58:43.971 --> 01:58:43.971
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2428
01:58:43.971 --> 01:58:47.700
<v Speaker 3>When did we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called the procession of the </v>

2429
01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:47.700
<v Speaker 3>equinox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2430
01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:47.700
<v Speaker 3>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the second.</v>

2431
01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a difference.</v>

2432
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.240
<v Speaker 3>That's the changing tilt of the Earth's </v>
<v Speaker 3>axis,</v>

2433
01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:57.690
<v Speaker 3>which which kind of is a wobble and nods</v>
<v Speaker 3>back if there's a wobble and there's a </v>

2434
01:58:57.690 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 3>tilt and then there's actually a tilt </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the tilt.</v>

2435
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:00.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2436
01:59:00.431 --> 01:59:01.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the.</v>

2437
01:59:01.101 --> 01:59:06.101
<v Speaker 3>This is the view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the effect is because the earth is </v>

2438
01:59:06.101 --> 01:59:09.241
<v Speaker 3>the viewing platform from which we </v>
<v Speaker 3>observed the stars in which we observed </v>

2439
01:59:09.241 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 3>the other celestial bodies such as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon and the sun.</v>

2440
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:14.730
<v Speaker 3>The earth is our viewing platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you change the orientation in space </v>

2441
01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:17.470
<v Speaker 3>of that viewing platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the rising points of stars,</v>

2442
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:18.820
<v Speaker 3>the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun change,</v>

2443
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:23.880
<v Speaker 3>and the positions of the stars in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky change and it becomes a kind of </v>

2444
01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.300
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you understand this,</v>

2445
01:59:25.301 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Speaker 3>that it is universally available to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the calculations can be done.</v>

2446
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:33.690
<v Speaker 3>We can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can buy a computer software </v>

2447
01:59:33.690 --> 01:59:36.241
<v Speaker 3>today which will show you the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>skies over at any point on the earth's </v>

2448
01:59:36.241 --> 01:59:37.270
<v Speaker 3>surface at anytime in the last 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2449
01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:42.300
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These and what's involved in those </v>

2450
01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.781
<v Speaker 3>computer simulations is simply </v>
<v Speaker 3>calculations that had been done in </v>

2451
01:59:45.781 --> 01:59:46.330
<v Speaker 3>previous centuries by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by astronomers,</v>

2452
01:59:46.331 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 3>and we understand these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these processes.</v>

2453
01:59:48.311 --> 01:59:53.311
<v Speaker 3>We can measure them and set them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there you have a regularity of </v>

2454
01:59:53.311 --> 01:59:57.001
<v Speaker 3>changing patterns in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tie that into architecture on the</v>

2455
01:59:57.461 --> 02:00:00.040
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then actually you have a way free of all</v>

2456
02:00:00.041 --> 02:00:01.960
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dating,</v>

2457
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:07.110
<v Speaker 3>of actually speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use this universal language of </v>

2458
02:00:07.110 --> 02:00:08.380
<v Speaker 3>the stars and architecture to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement to the future.</v>

2459
02:00:08.381 --> 02:00:12.880
<v Speaker 3>You can say that this particular time </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very important to me,</v>

2460
02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 3>to our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mattered to us,</v>

2461
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 3>it mattered to us so much that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>created this huge monument to freeze the</v>

2462
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:21.190
<v Speaker 3>skies over a particular point.</v>

2463
02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:24.340
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why those particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>constellations,</v>

2464
02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:26.170
<v Speaker 3>if at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were important to them.</v>

2465
02:00:26.230 --> 02:00:31.230
<v Speaker 3>That's where things get really strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I wanted to play devil's </v>

2466
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:31.230
<v Speaker 3>advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

2467
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:31.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these holes,</v>

2468
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:36.390
<v Speaker 3>they're pointing up towards the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a lot of fucking stars on the </v>

2469
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.390
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>

2470
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Just because they line up with this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand years ago,</v>

2471
02:00:39.701 --> 02:00:42.220
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean you weren't looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>

2472
02:00:42.221 --> 02:00:47.221
<v Speaker 3>So what you want is multiple locks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean take the pyramids of Giza and </v>

2473
02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:51.400
<v Speaker 3>here I cite the work of my close friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>and colleague,</v>

2474
02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Robert Robert Duvall in particular in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his book,</v>

2475
02:00:54.791 --> 02:00:56.230
<v Speaker 3>the Orion mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2476
02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you take the three great pyramids of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Giza and you look at the heavens </v>

2477
02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:06.930
<v Speaker 3>overhead and you also look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious system of the ancient </v>

2478
02:01:07.451 --> 02:01:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was important to them?</v>

2479
02:01:09.131 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 3>What did they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they believe?</v>

2480
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:13.120
<v Speaker 3>You pretty soon discovered that stars </v>
<v Speaker 3>were incredibly important to them.</v>

2481
02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Stars cover the inside of the ceilings </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2482
02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:19.870
<v Speaker 3>of all tombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the pharaohs tombs,</v>

2483
02:01:19.871 --> 02:01:20.920
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2484
02:01:21.110 --> 02:01:25.750
<v Speaker 3>a monuments are lined up to particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>places on the horizon.</v>

2485
02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:30.751
<v Speaker 3>Whereas star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's serious who's counterpart </v>

2486
02:01:30.751 --> 02:01:34.021
<v Speaker 3>amongst the gods was the goddess Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps it's a Ryan who's counterpart </v>

2487
02:01:34.021 --> 02:01:34.780
<v Speaker 3>amongst the gods who was the goddess </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyrus.</v>

2488
02:01:35.230 --> 02:01:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing.</v>

2489
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 3>You have a mythology that speaks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>entities who have,</v>

2490
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.510
<v Speaker 3>who are clearly stated to be connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to particular asterisks,</v>

2491
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular constellations.</v>

2492
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:49.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are The constellations that are being </v>

2493
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.870
<v Speaker 3>said to have a reflection upon the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and architecture,</v>

2494
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:51.860
<v Speaker 3>were they significant to the culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned?</v>

2495
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2496
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:58.630
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The constellation of Orion was of </v>

2497
02:01:58.630 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 3>enormous significance to the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians.</v>

2498
02:01:58.701 --> 02:02:03.701
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be a matter of interest that </v>

2499
02:02:03.701 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 3>the three pyramids on the ground are </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out in a pattern that is temptingly</v>

2500
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:07.300
<v Speaker 3>similar to the pattern of the three </v>
<v Speaker 3>belts,</v>

2501
02:02:07.301 --> 02:02:08.870
<v Speaker 3>stars of the Constellation of Orion.</v>

2502
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temptingly similar,</v>

2503
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:17.410
<v Speaker 3>but there's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have shafts which run through </v>

2504
02:02:17.410 --> 02:02:21.581
<v Speaker 3>the body of the Great Pyramid you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a place called the king's </v>

2505
02:02:21.581 --> 02:02:25.121
<v Speaker 3>chamber high up in the Great Pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a shaft and it's north and south </v>

2506
02:02:25.121 --> 02:02:28.211
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are about eight inches high and </v>

2507
02:02:28.211 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 3>eight inches wide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those shafts cut all the way through</v>

2508
02:02:28.461 --> 02:02:33.461
<v Speaker 3>the body of the pyramid and they come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on the south and north sides of the </v>

2509
02:02:33.461 --> 02:02:33.461
<v Speaker 3>pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually,</v>

2510
02:02:33.461 --> 02:02:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and it's been done in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can drop a cannonball in,</v>

2511
02:02:35.451 --> 02:02:40.451
<v Speaker 3>at the outside entrance to those shafts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they appear and that cannonball </v>

2512
02:02:40.451 --> 02:02:40.451
<v Speaker 3>moments later will appear in the king's </v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber,</v>

2513
02:02:40.451 --> 02:02:42.830
<v Speaker 3>the shelter about 200 feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2514
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:46.220
<v Speaker 3>In the Queens Chamber down below,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are also two shafts.</v>

2515
02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these shafts do not exit on the outside </v>

2516
02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:51.650
<v Speaker 3>of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which creates a mystery of its own,</v>

2517
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.760
<v Speaker 3>of great interest.</v>

2518
02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:54.200
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other end of those shots,</v>

2519
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:56.420
<v Speaker 3>but they do have very definite </v>
<v Speaker 3>alignments.</v>

2520
02:02:56.870 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 3>And what Robert was really the first to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show some archeo astronomers were,</v>

2521
02:03:01.431 --> 02:03:03.620
<v Speaker 3>we're onto this as well in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the stars,</v>

2522
02:03:03.621 --> 02:03:06.710
<v Speaker 3>but what Robert was really the first to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show is that in 2,500</v>

2523
02:03:06.711 --> 02:03:09.860
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the epoch in which Egyptologists say the</v>

2524
02:03:09.861 --> 02:03:14.861
<v Speaker 3>pyramids were built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those foreshafts that shoot up </v>

2525
02:03:14.861 --> 02:03:19.090
<v Speaker 3>out of the king's chamber and the Queen </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chamber all targeted very significant </v>

2526
02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:21.830
<v Speaker 3>stars in the sky at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>

2527
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:26.831
<v Speaker 3>the southern shaft of the Queens Chamber</v>
<v Speaker 3>targeted the star Sirius at exactly the </v>

2528
02:03:26.831 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 3>moment that the star crosses the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Meridian.</v>

2529
02:03:28.610 --> 02:03:33.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the north south line that divides</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky above our heads at exactly the </v>

2530
02:03:33.610 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 3>moment that the star crosses that line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shaft targets it and you could,</v>

2531
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.080
<v Speaker 3>you could fire a laser beam up and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit that.</v>

2532
02:03:39.190 --> 02:03:40.820
<v Speaker 3>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd hit that,</v>

2533
02:03:40.821 --> 02:03:41.380
<v Speaker 3>start the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2534
02:03:41.381 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the alignment is that great.</v>

2535
02:03:42.471 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 3>So they locking the pyramid in in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>epoch of 2,500</v>

2536
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two four significant stars in the sky.</v>

2537
02:03:50.001 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Another one of those stars is the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 3>star of the belt of Orion.</v>

2538
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:59.200
<v Speaker 3>That tells us that this is a dating </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism of some kind and it it can't </v>

2539
02:03:59.961 --> 02:04:03.260
<v Speaker 3>be an accident that that's the case and </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you understand procession,</v>

2540
02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you understand that these alignments </v>
<v Speaker 3>will change,</v>

2541
02:04:04.791 --> 02:04:09.791
<v Speaker 3>so therefore it becomes very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discover that the orientation of the </v>

2542
02:04:09.791 --> 02:04:13.811
<v Speaker 3>pyramids on the ground is that which </v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert argues are the terrestrial </v>

2543
02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:17.300
<v Speaker 3>reflection of the three stars of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt of Orion,</v>

2544
02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:22.540
<v Speaker 3>that the orientation of the pyramids on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground because of procession shifts </v>

2545
02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.840
<v Speaker 3>very slowly down the ages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

2546
02:04:23.841 --> 02:04:28.841
<v Speaker 3>and you can see this clearly on any good</v>
<v Speaker 3>sky map program as you go back in time,</v>

2547
02:04:29.121 --> 02:04:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you find that the constellation of Orion</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment it crosses the Meridian.</v>

2548
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.240
<v Speaker 3>The same place that was targeting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>star Sirius at the moment.</v>

2549
02:04:35.241 --> 02:04:40.241
<v Speaker 3>It crosses the Meridian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the perfect alignment between the </v>

2550
02:04:40.241 --> 02:04:43.110
<v Speaker 3>belt stars for Ryan and the three Great </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pyramids of Giza is not in 2,500</v>

2551
02:04:43.111 --> 02:04:44.820
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in 10,500</v>

2552
02:04:44.821 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>8,000</v>

2553
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:50.721
<v Speaker 3>years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a very interesting problem </v>

2554
02:04:50.721 --> 02:04:54.111
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either it's all coincidence or the </v>

2555
02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:55.590
<v Speaker 3>pyramids are monuments that speak both </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the age of the ancient Egyptians,</v>

2556
02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:58.110
<v Speaker 3>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC and to a much earlier time,</v>

2557
02:04:58.530 --> 02:05:03.530
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also the same time where the Sphinx was </v>

2558
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.530
<v Speaker 3>pointing towards the Constellation Leo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2559
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:05.130
<v Speaker 3>that's the again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third part of the lock,</v>

2560
02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:10.131
<v Speaker 3>and Robert and I looked at this in depth</v>
<v Speaker 3>together in our book called the message </v>

2561
02:05:10.131 --> 02:05:12.300
<v Speaker 3>of the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we have the Giza plateau.</v>

2562
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 3>We have the three pyramids laid out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground in the pattern of the belt of</v>

2563
02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Orion in 10,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>

2564
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.940
<v Speaker 3>That's looking south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now let's look east.</v>

2565
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's look Julie's east east of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the sunrises,</v>

2566
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:28.880
<v Speaker 3>but people who don't observe the sun </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't realize that the sun tracks back </v>

2567
02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:32.241
<v Speaker 3>and forth along the horizon during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar year reaches its most northern </v>

2568
02:05:32.241 --> 02:05:33.540
<v Speaker 3>most point on the summer solstice 21st </v>
<v Speaker 3>of June,</v>

2569
02:05:33.541 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's southern most point on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>winter solstice 20,</v>

2570
02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of December.</v>

2571
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:45.410
<v Speaker 3>On the equinox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The day that night and day are of equal </v>

2572
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 3>length.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sunrises directly,</v>

2573
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:52.131
<v Speaker 3>perfectly due east.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually how you define an </v>

2574
02:05:52.131 --> 02:05:54.831
<v Speaker 3>equinox because the sun is rising </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly Jewish and looking at it is </v>

2575
02:05:54.831 --> 02:05:59.271
<v Speaker 3>the sphinx aligned gazing directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly at the point of sunrise.</v>

2576
02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Now we have to consider what's behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun.</v>

2577
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Then what is the constellation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zodiac that the sun is rising in because</v>

2578
02:06:10.471 --> 02:06:12.370
<v Speaker 3>that's what the Zodiac is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>

2579
02:06:12.370 --> 02:06:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a group of constellations that by </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance that the son passes through </v>

2580
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:22.160
<v Speaker 3>during the course of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that the constellation that the sun </v>

2581
02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:23.640
<v Speaker 3>rises against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the background of it is also affected by</v>

2582
02:06:23.641 --> 02:06:25.950
<v Speaker 3>precession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wobble on the axis of the earth,</v>

2583
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:27.690
<v Speaker 3>and that changes.</v>

2584
02:06:28.290 --> 02:06:33.290
<v Speaker 3>You have roughly 2,160</v>
<v Speaker 3>years in each house of the Zodiac for </v>

2585
02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:34.020
<v Speaker 3>the last 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>160 years.</v>

2586
02:06:34.021 --> 02:06:39.021
<v Speaker 3>We've been in Pisces and as I often say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an accident that the the early </v>

2587
02:06:39.021 --> 02:06:43.881
<v Speaker 3>Christians use the fish as their symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before that it was the constellation of </v>

2588
02:06:43.881 --> 02:06:48.230
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ram Ram's were incredibly important </v>

2589
02:06:48.230 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 3>in the year from 2000 down to the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Christ.</v>

2590
02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Just look at the biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2591
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:54.710
<v Speaker 3>to cut a long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Great Sphinx is a lion,</v>

2592
02:06:55.350 --> 02:07:00.350
<v Speaker 3>admittedly with a human head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that head is rather small and we </v>

2593
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 3>think that the head almost certainly was</v>
<v Speaker 3>recovered in a later time.</v>

2594
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Probably the whole statute was </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally Elian crouching there on the </v>

2595
02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.830
<v Speaker 3>horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gazing Julie East at the rising sun on </v>

2596
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:12.900
<v Speaker 3>the equinox and at the Constellation </v>
<v Speaker 3>pint the sun,</v>

2597
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.740
<v Speaker 3>and that constellation is in 10,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

2598
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:21.830
<v Speaker 3>the constellation of Leo as above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So below Leo speaking to the Sphinx,</v>

2599
02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan speaking to the pyramids,</v>

2600
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:28.500
<v Speaker 3>locking in to a date that is far before </v>
<v Speaker 3>any civilization began.</v>

2601
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.660
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm on a long wrap here,</v>

2602
02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.520
<v Speaker 3>but just at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

2603
02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.030
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

2604
02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 3>at that point when the egyptologist </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2605
02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:40.501
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible for there to be any </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like a civilization at Giza 12 and</v>

2606
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:45.691
<v Speaker 3>a half thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just when they're very happy saying </v>

2607
02:07:45.691 --> 02:07:48.001
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're telling us that no other </v>

2608
02:07:48.001 --> 02:07:48.001
<v Speaker 3>monument can be found anywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2609
02:07:48.001 --> 02:07:48.430
<v Speaker 3>which is 12 and a half thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old on this scale.</v>

2610
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up pops go directly to Epi in Turkey.</v>

2611
02:07:53.590 --> 02:07:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Go back to in the area of Turkey that by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way was once historic Armenia go,</v>

2612
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Beckley tempe pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dated by the German archeological </v>

2613
02:08:03.930 --> 02:08:07.621
<v Speaker 3>institute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They discovered that this huge complex </v>

2614
02:08:07.621 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 3>of stone circles has been deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 3>buried 10,000</v>

2615
02:08:08.801 --> 02:08:11.800
<v Speaker 3>years ago and the carbon dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't date stones,</v>

2616
02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:16.801
<v Speaker 3>you have to date organic materials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carbon dating of organic materials </v>

2617
02:08:16.801 --> 02:08:20.011
<v Speaker 3>found with those stone circles puts </v>
<v Speaker 3>their age back to 12,000</v>

2618
02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:21.040
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2619
02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm more for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That must have been like Christmas.</v>

2620
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:25.080
<v Speaker 3>It was Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Christmas.</v>

2621
02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 3>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a gift.</v>

2622
02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2623
02:08:27.191 --> 02:08:28.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2624
02:08:28.071 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to confess.</v>

2625
02:08:31.091 --> 02:08:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all have egos.</v>

2626
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to confess that,</v>

2627
02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:38.850
<v Speaker 3>that it was a nice moment for me when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the New Scientist magazine in Britain,</v>

2628
02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:45.360
<v Speaker 3>which years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the nineties when I published </v>

2629
02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.761
<v Speaker 3>fingerprints of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was amongst the magazines that tact my </v>

2630
02:08:47.761 --> 02:08:48.980
<v Speaker 3>work as quote unquote pseudoscientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of the.</v>

2631
02:08:48.981 --> 02:08:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how my work can be pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific because I don't claim to be a</v>

2632
02:08:51.311 --> 02:08:53.050
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking journalist.</v>

2633
02:08:53.051 --> 02:08:53.650
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2634
02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I be a pseudo scientists,</v>

2635
02:08:55.871 --> 02:08:58.030
<v Speaker 3>but here's a guy who's got an obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an idea.</v>

2636
02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm a little weed,</v>

2637
02:09:00.851 --> 02:09:05.851
<v Speaker 3>like that's actually New Scientist </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine back in the 19 nineties was </v>

2638
02:09:10.301 --> 02:09:15.301
<v Speaker 3>saying that I was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the basic message of fingerprints </v>

2639
02:09:15.301 --> 02:09:17.761
<v Speaker 3>of the gods is history as much older and</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more mysterious than we'd been </v>

2640
02:09:17.761 --> 02:09:20.851
<v Speaker 3>told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was great in October 2013 when </v>

2641
02:09:20.851 --> 02:09:20.851
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2642
02:09:20.851 --> 02:09:23.940
<v Speaker 3>This magazine came out with a headline </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying history is much older and more </v>

2643
02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 3>mysterious than we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

2644
02:09:24.170 --> 02:09:29.170
<v Speaker 3>The Hancock was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Title showed up in my next.</v>

2645
02:09:29.601 --> 02:09:34.601
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my next life we were fucking with </v>

2646
02:09:34.601 --> 02:09:34.601
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was,</v>

2647
02:09:34.601 --> 02:09:36.850
<v Speaker 3>there was happy and that's what changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2648
02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really done.</v>

2649
02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:43.220
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just say I guess we may be running </v>

2650
02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:43.220
<v Speaker 3>out of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just say,</v>

2651
02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:43.960
<v Speaker 3>are we good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just say also Indonesia,</v>

2652
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:49.320
<v Speaker 3>which is the other place that my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>Santha and I've done a lot of research </v>

2653
02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.840
<v Speaker 3>in the last six or seven months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been found.</v>

2654
02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.080
<v Speaker 3>What was thought to be a 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old site on top of the hill.</v>

2655
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a site made of blocks of columnar </v>
<v Speaker 3>basalt,</v>

2656
02:10:02.710 --> 02:10:06.010
<v Speaker 3>which forms naturally but which can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>used as a construction medium.</v>

2657
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Gunung Padang.</v>

2658
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:14.670
<v Speaker 3>And on the top of the hill in a series </v>
<v Speaker 3>of terraces is a rather extraordinary </v>

2659
02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:15.550
<v Speaker 3>monument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought to be about 2,500</v>

2660
02:10:15.551 --> 02:10:20.551
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made of these blocks of columnar </v>

2661
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:20.551
<v Speaker 3>battled.</v>

2662
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no really thorough research has ever </v>

2663
02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.471
<v Speaker 3>done by archeologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of trenching down to about </v>

2664
02:10:25.471 --> 02:10:28.170
<v Speaker 3>half of half a meter in depth was done </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some carbon was brought up and </v>

2665
02:10:28.170 --> 02:10:28.570
<v Speaker 3>dated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really the site,</v>

2666
02:10:28.571 --> 02:10:33.571
<v Speaker 3>it was just kind of taken for granted </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was two and a half thousand </v>

2667
02:10:33.571 --> 02:10:34.540
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Along comes Danny Natoya ggn,</v>

2668
02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:39.820
<v Speaker 3>who is a caltech trained phd geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a working out of the city of Bandung in </v>

2669
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:43.310
<v Speaker 3>a government agency of the Indonesian </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

2670
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:45.590
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he particularly focuses on earthquakes.</v>

2671
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Earthquakes are his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2672
02:10:47.630 --> 02:10:51.290
<v Speaker 3>he comes along and he's intrigued by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gunung Padang first of all,</v>

2673
02:10:51.291 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 3>that there's old traditions about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a sacred place.</v>

2674
02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:56.000
<v Speaker 3>It's go back at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed to go back a very,</v>

2675
02:10:56.001 --> 02:11:01.001
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long way and he starts to look at </v>

2676
02:11:01.001 --> 02:11:01.430
<v Speaker 3>it as a geologist and what he realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>is suddenly it comes to him.</v>

2677
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:03.200
<v Speaker 3>He's not looking at a natural hill.</v>

2678
02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:08.560
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at a pyramid on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this relatively recent </v>

2679
02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.040
<v Speaker 3>monument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody built a pyramid there,</v>

2680
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.890
<v Speaker 3>so he begins work on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's covered in dirt.</v>

2681
02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a grown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's inside.</v>

2682
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:17.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a manmade structure.</v>

2683
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:19.430
<v Speaker 3>That was Danny's intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he had to prove it,</v>

2684
02:11:19.431 --> 02:11:24.431
<v Speaker 3>so he put together a team and they did a</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge amount of remote sensing work and </v>

2685
02:11:24.431 --> 02:11:28.340
<v Speaker 3>some core drilling down to depths of </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 15 meters into the top of the hill</v>

2686
02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.240
<v Speaker 3>and what they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they discovered was incredibly </v>

2687
02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:34.240
<v Speaker 3>tempting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it supports Dan,</v>

2688
02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:36.230
<v Speaker 3>his intuition that we are looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>manmade pyramid here.</v>

2689
02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 3>It has produces dates that go back as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as 26,000</v>

2690
02:11:40.701 --> 02:11:45.701
<v Speaker 3>years right into the last ice age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the remote sensing equipment shows </v>

2691
02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.700
<v Speaker 3>rather regular cavities inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>monument,</v>

2692
02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.210
<v Speaker 3>which looked like chambers of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2693
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:58.211
<v Speaker 3>naturally Danny and his team were </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped working for quite a long while </v>

2694
02:11:58.211 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 3>by the archeological establishment in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia who said,</v>

2695
02:11:59.931 --> 02:12:04.931
<v Speaker 3>we know that this structure is two and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half thousand years old and there's no </v>

2696
02:12:04.931 --> 02:12:08.051
<v Speaker 3>need for any further research on it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just disturbs the local villages and </v>

2697
02:12:08.051 --> 02:12:08.051
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2698
02:12:08.051 --> 02:12:08.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go away.</v>

2699
02:12:08.290 --> 02:12:10.220
<v Speaker 3>And so they lobbied and they had him </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped.</v>

2700
02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but donny took it to the highest level.</v>

2701
02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:17.620
<v Speaker 3>He got the support of the Indonesian </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and two and a half weeks ago </v>

2702
02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:19.940
<v Speaker 3>they started work excavating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly excavating.</v>

2703
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And so far the results look very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to see a building 26,000,</v>

2704
02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 3>26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2705
02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:28.850
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2706
02:12:28.851 --> 02:12:31.280
<v Speaker 3>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't summon up a map magically,</v>

2707
02:12:31.281 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 3>but if I were to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider Indonesia,</v>

2708
02:12:33.261 --> 02:12:38.261
<v Speaker 3>which is a long string of islands today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go back 12 and a half </v>

2709
02:12:38.571 --> 02:12:40.510
<v Speaker 3>thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that long strip of art,</v>

2710
02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 3>string of islands is joined to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic mainland,</v>

2711
02:12:43.670 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2712
02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 3>ice age continent because sea level is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of feet lower.</v>

2713
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia becomes actually quite a </v>

2714
02:12:53.710 --> 02:12:54.290
<v Speaker 3>plausible play place for some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole of records,</v>

2715
02:12:54.291 --> 02:12:59.010
<v Speaker 3>some sort of time capsule because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rebecca is also a time capsule that's so</v>

2716
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.770
<v Speaker 3>absolutely incredible.</v>

2717
02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't say fascinating anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people started giving me shit about it.</v>

2718
02:13:04.290 --> 02:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Last few podcasts I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when things are </v>

2719
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would camp come up with any.</v>

2720
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.860
<v Speaker 3>You know me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was my way of going,</v>

2721
02:13:09.861 --> 02:13:14.861
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's interesting stuff happening </v>

2722
02:13:14.861 --> 02:13:17.711
<v Speaker 3>happening in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been lucky to spend some time </v>

2723
02:13:17.711 --> 02:13:20.920
<v Speaker 3>exploring this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am writing a sequel to my best known </v>

2724
02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:20.920
<v Speaker 3>book and undoubtedly his fingerprints of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gods,</v>

2725
02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 3>the evidence for earth lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

2726
02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 3>There was that 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1995,</v>

2727
02:13:26.721 --> 02:13:31.721
<v Speaker 3>and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after being scorned and put down by the </v>

2728
02:13:31.721 --> 02:13:36.471
<v Speaker 3>archeological establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is enough new evidence out there </v>

2729
02:13:36.471 --> 02:13:38.340
<v Speaker 3>for me to produce a whole other book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole other story to tell.</v>

2730
02:13:38.341 --> 02:13:43.341
<v Speaker 3>Not An update of fingerprints of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gods would with a new book which looks </v>

2731
02:13:43.341 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 3>at all of this information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in Stonehenge?</v>

2732
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:48.830
<v Speaker 3>This most recent monuments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they discovered bigger than the rest of </v>

2733
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Stonehenge stonehedge.</v>

2734
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:50.250
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>

2735
02:13:50.251 --> 02:13:55.251
<v Speaker 3>you see this why archeologist need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more humble because the next </v>

2736
02:13:55.251 --> 02:13:56.970
<v Speaker 3>turn of the spade can change everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely alter the story and we should</v>

2737
02:13:56.971 --> 02:14:01.860
<v Speaker 3>always remain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remain open to just a one discovery like</v>

2738
02:14:01.861 --> 02:14:04.950
<v Speaker 3>that one farmer finding this stone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back with on earth.</v>

2739
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:08.850
<v Speaker 3>This incredible structure that rewrites </v>
<v Speaker 3>history literally turn to the space.</v>

2740
02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.840
<v Speaker 3>That piece of stone is seen by American </v>
<v Speaker 3>archeologists in the 19 fifties really,</v>

2741
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:17.930
<v Speaker 3>and they decide not to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so finely done that they </v>

2742
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:20.850
<v Speaker 3>think it belongs to the Ottoman period </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the last four or 500 years.</v>

2743
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Actually it turns out to be 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2744
02:14:23.950 --> 02:14:25.380
<v Speaker 3>What's good that they didn't fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

2745
02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.280
<v Speaker 3>It's cool that it happens this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got The German archeological institute </v>

2746
02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:36.981
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately they've stuck a hideous </v>

2747
02:14:36.981 --> 02:14:36.981
<v Speaker 3>roof over the top of the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they have.</v>

2748
02:14:36.981 --> 02:14:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to keep it from decaying or </v>

2749
02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:41.060
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2750
02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 3>it was 19 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was exposed to.</v>

2751
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:43.190
<v Speaker 3>The Sun was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was being.</v>

2752
02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:46.860
<v Speaker 3>They began the excavations in 1996 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

2753
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now that they finished the </v>

2754
02:14:52.130 --> 02:14:54.051
<v Speaker 3>excavations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided that in that particular </v>

2755
02:14:54.051 --> 02:14:54.051
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're excavating other areas,</v>

2756
02:14:54.051 --> 02:14:55.560
<v Speaker 3>they decide to stick this horrendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>roof over it,</v>

2757
02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:01.460
<v Speaker 3>which cuts out the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it impossible to see the stump is </v>

2758
02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.610
<v Speaker 3>the roof is badly built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it there are platforms built inside </v>

2759
02:15:04.610 --> 02:15:05.190
<v Speaker 3>it on which huge heaps of stones have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been part of.</v>

2760
02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:08.040
<v Speaker 3>That's to keep the roof on if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>any high winds,</v>

2761
02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:12.150
<v Speaker 3>so suddenly so suddenly the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>of any kind of magical experience at the</v>

2762
02:15:12.151 --> 02:15:17.151
<v Speaker 3>world's most intriguing and mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient site is completely written off </v>

2763
02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 3>by this hideous piece of soco protective</v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture,</v>

2764
02:15:20.071 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 3>which in my view is just the worst kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of vandalism.</v>

2765
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I've really offended by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to.</v>

2766
02:15:25.051 --> 02:15:30.051
<v Speaker 3>I was in Tibet in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back again this year and I am.</v>

2767
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I was just horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It made me feel physically sick to see </v>

2768
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.270
<v Speaker 3>what had been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have been done to it.</v>

2769
02:15:35.370 --> 02:15:38.040
<v Speaker 3>That's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The desire to.</v>

2770
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Is it because to sell tickets so people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to pay to get in there?</v>

2771
02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a kind of.</v>

2772
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.760
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a kind of possession.</v>

2773
02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:51.570
<v Speaker 3>This is ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen it with the experts,</v>

2774
02:15:51.571 --> 02:15:53.430
<v Speaker 3>with the authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else.</v>

2775
02:15:53.431 --> 02:15:58.431
<v Speaker 3>We're really get to form an opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because we're going to damage </v>

2776
02:15:58.431 --> 02:16:00.210
<v Speaker 3>it's appearance so much in protecting it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it'll,</v>

2777
02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that it'll lose its essential mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2778
02:16:03.661 --> 02:16:06.390
<v Speaker 3>it just seems bizarre that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to protect stone.</v>

2779
02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:07.950
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2780
02:16:07.951 --> 02:16:12.951
<v Speaker 3>imagine if someone decided to put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant canopy over the sphinx and be </v>

2781
02:16:12.951 --> 02:16:12.951
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

2782
02:16:12.951 --> 02:16:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Big Bear forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is being done at archeological </v>

2783
02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>sites around the world has been done at </v>
<v Speaker 3>dre and I go him in,</v>

2784
02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 3>in Malta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which have profound,</v>

2785
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:24.861
<v Speaker 3>astronomical alignments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stick a fucking great dome over the </v>

2786
02:16:24.861 --> 02:16:24.861
<v Speaker 3>top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2787
02:16:24.861 --> 02:16:28.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being done at Rosslyn Chapel in </v>

2788
02:16:28.690 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Edinburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything and the worst of the worst</v>

2789
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 4>vandals or often the authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those who,</v>

2790
02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:33.640
<v Speaker 4>those who are in control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2791
02:16:33.641 --> 02:16:35.470
<v Speaker 4>that's how we asked guys in the pokey </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2792
02:16:35.471 --> 02:16:36.820
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not,</v>

2793
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:38.440
<v Speaker 4>didn't get arrest him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did,</v>

2794
02:16:38.441 --> 02:16:39.550
<v Speaker 4>but all the challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Withdrawal.</v>

2795
02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:43.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came up with some shackles situation.</v>

2796
02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:47.050
<v Speaker 4>He said he's a big front man for Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still running everything over there.</v>

2797
02:16:47.051 --> 02:16:48.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not running everything,</v>

2798
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 4>but he's got an official position in </v>
<v Speaker 4>relation to the promotion of tourism and</v>

2799
02:16:52.211 --> 02:16:56.230
<v Speaker 4>so bizarre when you see those guys so </v>
<v Speaker 4>vehemently opposed to new information,</v>

2800
02:16:56.231 --> 02:17:01.231
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially what the idea is </v>
<v Speaker 4>being proposed are there's new </v>

2801
02:17:01.231 --> 02:17:01.231
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2802
02:17:01.231 --> 02:17:05.790
<v Speaker 4>There's certain pieces of new </v>
<v Speaker 4>information that in my mind or just </v>

2803
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:06.710
<v Speaker 4>undeniable the Robert Schoch stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2804
02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I my first trip to go back to Tempe,</v>

2805
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:13.480
<v Speaker 4>Robert Shuck and I traveled together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys made a video,</v>

2806
02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:15.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some filming yet,</v>

2807
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:16.660
<v Speaker 4>but we were.</v>

2808
02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:19.340
<v Speaker 4>We were at Rebecca tappy in December.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2809
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:21.790
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not go back to tempe at Gunung Padang in</v>

2810
02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shock and I were were there in December </v>

2811
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:29.760
<v Speaker 4>2013 and then I went back again with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was his impression of it?</v>

2812
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:32.800
<v Speaker 4>His impression was very much that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is an intriguing site.</v>

2813
02:17:32.801 --> 02:17:34.480
<v Speaker 4>He looked at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you as a geologist,</v>

2814
02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:39.481
<v Speaker 4>he can understand what remote scanning </v>
<v Speaker 4>paperwork looks like and he looked at </v>

2815
02:17:39.481 --> 02:17:41.110
<v Speaker 4>what Danny's team had produced and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is absolutely fascinating.</v>

2816
02:17:41.111 --> 02:17:44.590
<v Speaker 4>It really deserves further research and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's now what it's getting fortunate.</v>

2817
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just amazing when they uncover </v>

2818
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:51.571
<v Speaker 4>these things like I love the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they find in Mexico when they're like </v>

2819
02:17:51.571 --> 02:17:54.040
<v Speaker 4>building something and then they stumble</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon some ancient Aztec temple.</v>

2820
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Not many people who go to Chichen Itza </v>
<v Speaker 4>and see the temple of cookware can </v>

2821
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.500
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pyramidical con,</v>

2822
02:17:59.530 --> 02:18:01.460
<v Speaker 4>which is the famous monument petition </v>
<v Speaker 4>eater.</v>

2823
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Not many people realize that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>another pyramid inside it which is </v>

2824
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:11.000
<v Speaker 4>inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a little door at the bottom of </v>

2825
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.310
<v Speaker 4>the stairway and I don't think it can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>done now.</v>

2826
02:18:12.311 --> 02:18:14.770
<v Speaker 4>The place has been so tightly </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled.</v>

2827
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people even allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>climb the pyramid of cuckold con.</v>

2828
02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:23.250
<v Speaker 4>When did they stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that stopped in the last two </v>

2829
02:18:23.250 --> 02:18:23.250
<v Speaker 4>or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was bare.</v>

2830
02:18:23.250 --> 02:18:27.910
<v Speaker 4>I know it may be a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the last time I was there was </v>

2831
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:30.451
<v Speaker 4>in 2010 and then it was stopped with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Roseann by people's feet.</v>

2832
02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:35.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe maybe all kinds of arguments,</v>

2833
02:18:35.441 --> 02:18:40.441
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is it was possible to </v>

2834
02:18:40.441 --> 02:18:40.441
<v Speaker 4>climate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2835
02:18:40.441 --> 02:18:42.520
<v Speaker 4>I used to back in the nineties anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside it is a whole second pyramid.</v>

2836
02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.640
<v Speaker 4>The pyramid that we see has been built </v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of an earlier one and there's a </v>

2837
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 4>passageway leads up to the top of it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an altar and there's a figure of</v>

2838
02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:51.310
<v Speaker 4>a Puma or a Jaguar.</v>

2839
02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:53.860
<v Speaker 4>Inside is very spooky place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2840
02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That whole.</v>

2841
02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.990
<v Speaker 4>The whole complex is so incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so amazing to think that,</v>

2842
02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:01.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you scuba dive.</v>

2843
02:19:01.210 --> 02:19:04.140
<v Speaker 4>You ever done those tunnels that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>found in the Senate?</v>

2844
02:19:04.330 --> 02:19:05.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2845
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Those are terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people scuba dive and they go.</v>

2846
02:19:09.431 --> 02:19:13.600
<v Speaker 4>There's is mind tunnels that they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>found that are underwater.</v>

2847
02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:14.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to,</v>

2848
02:19:14.411 --> 02:19:19.411
<v Speaker 4>but the people that are treasure hunters</v>
<v Speaker 4>have gone into these things and you </v>

2849
02:19:19.411 --> 02:19:19.411
<v Speaker 4>found these incredible artifacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2850
02:19:19.411 --> 02:19:22.040
<v Speaker 4>but you gotta be willing to swim </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwater.</v>

2851
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Scuba gear in a dark tunnel for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2852
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 4>They're long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can get a mile in</v>

2853
02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.200
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temporary takes.</v>

2854
02:19:30.201 --> 02:19:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Tremendous courage also takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes very special equipment.</v>

2855
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2856
02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>you're having to having to carry a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more air with you and it would be a very</v>

2857
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:42.110
<v Speaker 3>complex mixture of gases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they have narrow pastures.</v>

2858
02:19:42.111 --> 02:19:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to squeeze through one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most cave?</v>

2859
02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Cave diving is one of the most dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you know,</v>

2860
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:49.580
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'll tell you why,</v>

2861
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>because the entrance passage can be long</v>
<v Speaker 3>and winding.</v>

2862
02:19:52.311 --> 02:19:57.311
<v Speaker 3>There can be several alternative routes </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it and it's often heavily laden </v>

2863
02:19:57.311 --> 02:19:59.410
<v Speaker 3>with silt with sediment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the dry,</v>

2864
02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:03.560
<v Speaker 3>if the diver is not very experienced or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if the diver panics and starts thrashing</v>

2865
02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.030
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that silt,</v>

2866
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:10.090
<v Speaker 3>silt gets thrown up into the water and </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely fills the water so that you </v>

2867
02:20:10.090 --> 02:20:13.661
<v Speaker 3>can't see your hand in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>face and suddenly your mile in 100 feet </v>

2868
02:20:14.271 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 3>deep and blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

2869
02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:23.740
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>freak out you've ever had on a podcast </v>

2870
02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:27.490
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that me thinking that was </v>

2871
02:20:27.490 --> 02:20:27.620
<v Speaker 3>just a tremendous freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2872
02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:32.680
<v Speaker 3>just the idea of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that it's going to run out of </v>

2873
02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:32.680
<v Speaker 3>air before it settles to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2874
02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're done for.</v>

2875
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Unless unless you can find your way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless by some miracle you can find your</v>

2876
02:20:37.941 --> 02:20:40.070
<v Speaker 3>way through that fog where the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing,</v>

2877
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:45.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to do is you have to calm </v>

2878
02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:45.130
<v Speaker 3>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're freaking me out,</v>

2879
02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:46.340
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2880
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:47.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2881
02:20:47.930 --> 02:20:49.640
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about my novels then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2882
02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:51.620
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people are just brave as far.</v>

2883
02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:54.350
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that people are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2884
02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:56.090
<v Speaker 3>It's guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's courage.</v>

2885
02:20:56.690 --> 02:20:59.390
<v Speaker 3>It's courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Courage of the warrior in a way.</v>

2886
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:02.260
<v Speaker 3>So is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many novels have you written there?</v>

2887
02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 3>So I've written three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the third.</v>

2888
02:21:04.641 --> 02:21:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written an entangled,</v>

2889
02:21:05.781 --> 02:21:10.781
<v Speaker 3>which is a whole other story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I've written volume one and </v>

2890
02:21:10.781 --> 02:21:11.000
<v Speaker 3>volume two of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2891
02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 3>the first volume was war God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knights of the,</v>

2892
02:21:12.921 --> 02:21:17.570
<v Speaker 3>which it was published in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a big support and take up from</v>

2893
02:21:17.571 --> 02:21:18.950
<v Speaker 3>your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has beautiful,</v>

2894
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:23.990
<v Speaker 3>really grateful for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard a lot of positive reviews to </v>

2895
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:23.990
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enjoyed it.</v>

2896
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I made A.</v>

2897
02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I made an offer at that time on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>show where I said that if people wrote </v>

2898
02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:32.840
<v Speaker 3>to me at a particular address,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is war God dedications@gmail.com,</v>

2899
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:37.340
<v Speaker 3>and sent me their own address and showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>me that they've pre ordered the book,</v>

2900
02:21:37.930 --> 02:21:41.450
<v Speaker 3>I would send them assigned dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>bookplate.</v>

2901
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:43.010
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would sign a label.</v>

2902
02:21:43.011 --> 02:21:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I would dedicate it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would send it to them.</v>

2903
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Little did I know that nearly 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would ask for those signed </v>

2904
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:50.270
<v Speaker 3>dedicated book plates.</v>

2905
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 3>It became a massive labor of love for </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and my wife Santha.</v>

2906
02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:59.840
<v Speaker 3>She's doing the envelope thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dealing with the correspondents </v>

2907
02:21:59.840 --> 02:21:59.900
<v Speaker 3>putting the signing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>signing the book plates.</v>

2908
02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:03.830
<v Speaker 3>We go to the post office were spending </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of pounds on postage and that.</v>

2909
02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.380
<v Speaker 3>But it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fantastic thing and it gave and</v>

2910
02:22:06.381 --> 02:22:09.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it helped the book to get noticed.</v>

2911
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was great skepticism about</v>

2912
02:22:11.721 --> 02:22:16.721
<v Speaker 3>buying a second volume from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>publishers unless the first volume </v>

2913
02:22:16.721 --> 02:22:20.080
<v Speaker 3>worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first volume worked enough for </v>

2914
02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:21.140
<v Speaker 3>me to to be commissioned to write volume</v>
<v Speaker 3>two of what God,</v>

2915
02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 3>which is called war God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>returned to the prelim serpent and that </v>

2916
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>is published on the ninth of October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm making the same special offer.</v>

2917
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Very Limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do to you,</v>

2918
02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:33.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First Time.</v>

2919
02:22:33.690 --> 02:22:36.300
<v Speaker 3>First off the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to my website,</v>

2920
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:40.920
<v Speaker 3>go to www.grahamhancock.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go to the war God page.</v>

2921
02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:43.560
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

2922
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down at the bottom of the page </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shows the covers of all the </v>

2923
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:50.070
<v Speaker 3>additions and you will find a statement </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2924
02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 3>And that is that if people write to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people preorder,</v>

2925
02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:58.250
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to preorder either order </v>

2926
02:22:58.250 --> 02:23:00.621
<v Speaker 3>volume one or preorder volume to Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't take your money until they </v>

2927
02:23:00.621 --> 02:23:02.820
<v Speaker 3>actually send the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've got the links to Amazon.com.</v>

2928
02:23:02.821 --> 02:23:07.821
<v Speaker 3>They're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will when I finished my travels and </v>

2929
02:23:07.821 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be on the road until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>27th of October.</v>

2930
02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but during November I will send out </v>

2931
02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.580
<v Speaker 3>those book plates again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I can't do this time is I can't</v>

2932
02:23:17.581 --> 02:23:19.530
<v Speaker 3>get into personal correspondence with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2933
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>It was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very touching and heart and heart</v>

2934
02:23:23.051 --> 02:23:28.051
<v Speaker 3>warming thing that so many people wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and so many of them I wanted to </v>

2935
02:23:28.051 --> 02:23:28.710
<v Speaker 3>speak back to them.</v>

2936
02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:29.850
<v Speaker 3>It's very cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2937
02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:32.050
<v Speaker 3>to receive a letter and not to reply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2938
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.840
<v Speaker 3>So I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

2939
02:23:33.841 --> 02:23:38.841
<v Speaker 3>The problem this year is that I've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to write the sequel to fingerprints of </v>

2940
02:23:38.841 --> 02:23:42.021
<v Speaker 3>the gods and I really need to start that</v>
<v Speaker 3>during November because my research </v>

2941
02:23:42.021 --> 02:23:45.510
<v Speaker 3>travels will be over at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to write that and I can't spend</v>

2942
02:23:45.511 --> 02:23:48.480
<v Speaker 3>two months or three months corresponding</v>
<v Speaker 3>in detail.</v>

2943
02:23:48.481 --> 02:23:50.580
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my offer is right to me.</v>

2944
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Show me that you've bought the book or </v>
<v Speaker 3>preordered volume to a and above all,</v>

2945
02:23:55.351 --> 02:23:58.200
<v Speaker 3>please give me your postal address </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't imagine how many times</v>

2946
02:23:58.201 --> 02:24:03.201
<v Speaker 3>people write to me asking for the book </v>
<v Speaker 3>flights and don't get me their postal </v>

2947
02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:06.081
<v Speaker 3>address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please give me your postal address and </v>

2948
02:24:06.081 --> 02:24:06.390
<v Speaker 3>when I get back from my travels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will sign the book plates.</v>

2949
02:24:06.450 --> 02:24:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I will send you a signed book plate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is simply a label that you can </v>

2950
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 3>stick inside your copy of the book and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if,</v>

2951
02:24:11.641 --> 02:24:15.810
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that results in a bit more uptake for</v>

2952
02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:20.960
<v Speaker 3>war God too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be good for me because it's very </v>

2953
02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:23.400
<v Speaker 3>difficult to start a new career as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>novelist at the age of 64.</v>

2954
02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we really enjoy it.</v>

2955
02:24:25.651 --> 02:24:30.651
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love writing novels and I love </v>

2956
02:24:30.651 --> 02:24:30.651
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I was talking about warriors</v>

2957
02:24:30.651 --> 02:24:34.791
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love getting into the spirit of the </v>

2958
02:24:34.791 --> 02:24:34.791
<v Speaker 3>warrior.</v>

2959
02:24:34.791 --> 02:24:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2960
02:24:35.971 --> 02:24:40.971
<v Speaker 3>it's just absolutely fascinating what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would drive a man like Cortez to take </v>

2961
02:24:40.971 --> 02:24:44.601
<v Speaker 3>490 men and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and face them against the might of the </v>

2962
02:24:44.601 --> 02:24:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Aztec Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of men under arms </v>

2963
02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:49.040
<v Speaker 3>who will kill you in the most awful way </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

2964
02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:53.510
<v Speaker 3>if they catch you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of will does it take to do </v>

2965
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.510
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2966
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:58.020
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been interesting for me to get </v>

2967
02:24:58.020 --> 02:24:59.781
<v Speaker 3>inside the heads of these people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also to consider because I'm interested </v>

2968
02:24:59.781 --> 02:25:03.621
<v Speaker 3>in them supernatural elements where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>being misled by demonic forces in some </v>

2969
02:25:03.621 --> 02:25:03.750
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that,</v>

2970
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.640
<v Speaker 3>that exam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I love doing it,</v>

2971
02:25:05.641 --> 02:25:10.641
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm known as a nonfiction author and </v>

2972
02:25:10.641 --> 02:25:10.710
<v Speaker 3>that's mainly what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2973
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.920
<v Speaker 3>people by nonfiction because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in the subject.</v>

2974
02:25:13.921 --> 02:25:18.921
<v Speaker 3>Very often people buy a novelist because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they trust that novelist and know that </v>

2975
02:25:18.921 --> 02:25:20.340
<v Speaker 3>his next book will be good leadership.</v>

2976
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Your fascination with demons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your fascination with </v>

2977
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:27.380
<v Speaker 3>supernatural influences and the concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>of demons?</v>

2978
02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.440
<v Speaker 3>For a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe in any spiritual </v>

2979
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:32.440
<v Speaker 3>element to life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2980
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see any of that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only really when I send,</v>

2981
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:36.160
<v Speaker 3>and this is where my credit is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>

2982
02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>handcuffs gone nuts.</v>

2983
02:25:37.271 --> 02:25:42.271
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was only really when I started </v>

2984
02:25:42.271 --> 02:25:44.281
<v Speaker 3>drinking Iowasca in 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose for a decade before that,</v>

2985
02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd been immersed in the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian texts.</v>

2986
02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:53.280
<v Speaker 3>And the ancient Egyptians are all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the quest for immortal life.</v>

2987
02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:56.590
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all about how you live this life</v>

2988
02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.920
<v Speaker 3>to continue on as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a spirit and ultimately to live the </v>

2989
02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:05.470
<v Speaker 3>life of millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they very clearly indicate that dark</v>

2990
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:10.471
<v Speaker 3>forces are at work in the universe which</v>
<v Speaker 3>can mislead us as well as there are </v>

2991
02:26:10.471 --> 02:26:11.740
<v Speaker 3>light and positive forces that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose to follow,</v>

2992
02:26:11.741 --> 02:26:16.080
<v Speaker 3>which will lead us into very nurturing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and worthwhile and excellent directions.</v>

2993
02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:19.180
<v Speaker 3>All those influences are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's there in ancient Egypt.</v>

2994
02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Then I start drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her in 2003 and I encounter,</v>

2995
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:27.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seamlessly convincing parallel realms,</v>

2996
02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:32.220
<v Speaker 3>inhabited by intelligent beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of whom a seem very dark and </v>

2997
02:26:33.341 --> 02:26:38.341
<v Speaker 3>dangerous and some have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of whom are filled with light </v>

2998
02:26:38.341 --> 02:26:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and joy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exercise the power of healing.</v>

2999
02:26:39.581 --> 02:26:44.581
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely accept that all of this </v>

3000
02:26:44.581 --> 02:26:46.960
<v Speaker 3>could be a projection or a creation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own mind,</v>

3001
02:26:46.961 --> 02:26:50.200
<v Speaker 3>that there is no exterior reality to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

3002
02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all there is.</v>

3003
02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's that way.</v>

3004
02:26:54.430 --> 02:26:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what happens in a deeply </v>

3005
02:26:59.430 --> 02:26:59.890
<v Speaker 3>altered state of consciousness is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've reached in the receiver wavelength</v>

3006
02:26:59.891 --> 02:27:04.891
<v Speaker 3>of the brain and and counter other </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of reality that are normally </v>

3007
02:27:05.681 --> 02:27:08.160
<v Speaker 3>closed off to our senses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing I would say to any.</v>

3008
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I know that a number of people who've </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked with psychedelics in depth </v>

3009
02:27:13.170 --> 02:27:14.050
<v Speaker 3>haven't come to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that,</v>

3010
02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:19.320
<v Speaker 3>but the conclusion that I come to my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little offering that I bring to the </v>

3011
02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.870
<v Speaker 3>table and that many others have brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there is a separate freestanding</v>

3012
02:27:22.871 --> 02:27:26.260
<v Speaker 3>reality of some kind which we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully understand yet.</v>

3013
02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:30.190
<v Speaker 3>And that in altered states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness we can encounter,</v>

3014
02:27:30.191 --> 02:27:33.770
<v Speaker 3>interact with that reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

3015
02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:38.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the view that I have now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that reality are spiritual forces.</v>

3016
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Some of which seem to eat fear in energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3017
02:27:42.731 --> 02:27:43.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3018
02:27:43.151 --> 02:27:45.490
<v Speaker 3>and dark energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thrive on.</v>

3019
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:48.450
<v Speaker 3>They think they seem to thrive on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's miserable or wicked or,</v>

3020
02:27:48.451 --> 02:27:48.850
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3021
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.630
<v Speaker 3>or cruel or thoughtless of viral about </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

3022
02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And at the other side of it are entities</v>
<v Speaker 3>that glow with light and love and that </v>

3023
02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.480
<v Speaker 3>and that seek to show us how we may </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring to light that divine spark within </v>

3024
02:28:04.901 --> 02:28:07.120
<v Speaker 3>us to go back to the GNOSTIC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gnostic idea,</v>

3025
02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:12.420
<v Speaker 3>those you encounter in a very direct way</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Iowaska journey,</v>

3026
02:28:13.210 --> 02:28:14.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because unlike,</v>

3027
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you do encounter them in the DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenny too,</v>

3028
02:28:16.751 --> 02:28:18.100
<v Speaker 3>they're not quite the same.</v>

3029
02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:21.500
<v Speaker 3>But unlike DMT I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it allows time for really processing and</v>

3030
02:28:21.501 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 3>thinking through what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing.</v>

3031
02:28:23.271 --> 02:28:25.070
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfolding over four hours,</v>

3032
02:28:25.071 --> 02:28:26.510
<v Speaker 3>not four or five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

3033
02:28:26.850 --> 02:28:27.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

3034
02:28:28.350 --> 02:28:31.460
<v Speaker 3>is a huge effect and it had a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on me and I,</v>

3035
02:28:31.461 --> 02:28:32.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3036
02:28:32.650 --> 02:28:34.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not adamant about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I accept.</v>

3037
02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:37.380
<v Speaker 3>I could be fantasizing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

3038
02:28:37.381 --> 02:28:40.080
<v Speaker 3>The other people encounter pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same beings and,</v>

3039
02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.120
<v Speaker 3>and the same sort of drive to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something better than they've done </v>

3040
02:28:45.171 --> 02:28:50.171
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that there's that </v>

3041
02:28:50.171 --> 02:28:52.871
<v Speaker 3>transpersonal side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose to believe that there are </v>

3042
02:28:52.871 --> 02:28:53.990
<v Speaker 3>freestanding parallel dimensions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are encountering them in altered</v>

3043
02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:58.991
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And therefore there's interesting </v>

3044
02:28:58.991 --> 02:29:01.031
<v Speaker 3>scientific work to be done because in </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory we could actually begin the </v>

3045
02:29:01.031 --> 02:29:04.031
<v Speaker 3>targeted exploration of those dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 3>by using volunteers on psychedelics.</v>

3046
02:29:05.151 --> 02:29:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I choose to believe that that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

3047
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I could be completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could just be the majesty of the </v>

3048
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.590
<v Speaker 3>human mind and we just invent all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>worlds.</v>

3049
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:16.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the most compelling argument </v>

3050
02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:18.761
<v Speaker 3>against it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the most compelling art </v>

3051
02:29:18.761 --> 02:29:21.040
<v Speaker 3>article?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A argument rather from a neurological </v>

3052
02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:21.770
<v Speaker 3>standpoint like has anybody ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to you like what's going on?</v>

3053
02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:23.690
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a compelling argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3054
02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.960
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a compelling argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reference frame and the </v>

3055
02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:32.141
<v Speaker 3>reference frame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is again where where I got </v>

3056
02:29:32.141 --> 02:29:34.421
<v Speaker 3>myself into so much trouble with Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reference frame is the reference </v>

3057
02:29:34.421 --> 02:29:37.901
<v Speaker 3>frame of materialist science and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reference frame says that all </v>

3058
02:29:37.901 --> 02:29:42.251
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is a kind of accidental </v>
<v Speaker 3>epi phenomenon of brain activity.</v>

3059
02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:46.250
<v Speaker 3>There's actually no reality to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

3060
02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:50.450
<v Speaker 3>That is not something that's been proven</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientifically and experimentally.</v>

3061
02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It is just the way that a large and </v>
<v Speaker 3>influential group of scientists see the </v>

3062
02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:57.710
<v Speaker 3>world that everything can be reduced to </v>
<v Speaker 3>material causes.</v>

3063
02:29:57.710 --> 02:30:01.190
<v Speaker 3>So the changes in brain activity that </v>
<v Speaker 3>accompany visions,</v>

3064
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you can measure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can observe those changes on MRI </v>

3065
02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:09.251
<v Speaker 3>scanner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those changes in brain activity are the </v>

3066
02:30:09.251 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 3>experience you're having according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this reference frame.</v>

3067
02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3068
02:30:11.531 --> 02:30:14.030
<v Speaker 3>your experience can be reduced to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing else to it,</v>

3069
02:30:14.031 --> 02:30:16.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a,</v>

3070
02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.090
<v Speaker 3>that is a philosophical view about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality works.</v>

3071
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:24.730
<v Speaker 3>We don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could easily be the other way round,</v>

3072
02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:26.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3073
02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:31.270
<v Speaker 3>that the brain activity is simply </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary in order for us to see </v>

3074
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:35.741
<v Speaker 3>something that was always there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was normally closed off to our </v>

3075
02:30:35.741 --> 02:30:35.741
<v Speaker 3>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

3076
02:30:35.741 --> 02:30:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the compelling argument as far as like,</v>

3077
02:30:39.010 --> 02:30:43.250
<v Speaker 3>what's happening when you're having </v>
<v Speaker 3>these extreme visual experiences,</v>

3078
02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:46.010
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the argument.</v>

3079
02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Has anybody ever tried to explain it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just some supposed to be some </v>

3080
02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:51.040
<v Speaker 3>chemical reaction with your cerebral </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortex?</v>

3081
02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:51.830
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3082
02:30:51.831 --> 02:30:56.831
<v Speaker 3>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the materialist reductionist </v>

3083
02:30:56.831 --> 02:30:57.410
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just that and nothing more.</v>

3084
02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:03.040
<v Speaker 3>But there's a whole other view on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick Strassman at the University of New </v>

3085
02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very familiar with his weight </v>

3086
02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:07.540
<v Speaker 3>because you presented the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>molecule.</v>

3087
02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick's Rick Strassman does entertain the</v>

3088
02:31:09.441 --> 02:31:14.441
<v Speaker 3>possibility that what is going on is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>merely in and of our brains but does </v>

3089
02:31:14.601 --> 02:31:17.690
<v Speaker 3>represent stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freestanding dimensions of reality.</v>

3090
02:31:17.691 --> 02:31:20.370
<v Speaker 3>We have no facts in but we have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly</v>

3091
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:22.950
<v Speaker 4>intriguing area to inquire into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3092
02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:28.260
<v Speaker 4>and it's also one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when you've experienced it </v>

3093
02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:31.641
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a really better frame of </v>

3094
02:31:31.641 --> 02:31:31.641
<v Speaker 4>reference as to why this is compelling </v>
<v Speaker 4>it all because it sounds preposterous to</v>

3095
02:31:31.641 --> 02:31:34.050
<v Speaker 4>someone who has no experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it really does.</v>

3096
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:35.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

3097
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:38.610
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to have loads of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying handcuffs at Draghi of course too</v>

3098
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:43.611
<v Speaker 4>late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's that thing that people want </v>

3099
02:31:43.611 --> 02:31:45.510
<v Speaker 4>when you want to define certain aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3100
02:31:45.530 --> 02:31:50.530
<v Speaker 4>of whatever the psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they seem to be almost impossible </v>

3101
02:31:52.141 --> 02:31:54.750
<v Speaker 4>to define for people who have actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced it.</v>

3102
02:31:54.751 --> 02:31:59.751
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is when someone who </v>

3103
02:31:59.751 --> 02:31:59.751
<v Speaker 4>hasn't experienced it tries to define it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

3104
02:31:59.751 --> 02:32:04.550
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can come up with a bunch of really </v>

3105
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:06.510
<v Speaker 4>compelling arguments from a medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>standpoint.</v>

3106
02:32:06.511 --> 02:32:11.511
<v Speaker 4>It's to like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the effect on the cerebral </v>

3107
02:32:11.511 --> 02:32:11.511
<v Speaker 4>cortex?</v>

3108
02:32:11.511 --> 02:32:12.210
<v Speaker 4>What's the effect on the visual aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3109
02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:12.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3110
02:32:12.751 --> 02:32:17.751
<v Speaker 4>your interpretation of this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of this chemical interacting </v>

3111
02:32:17.751 --> 02:32:17.751
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all fascinating,</v>

3112
02:32:17.751 --> 02:32:22.341
<v Speaker 4>amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the science is bad science to </v>

3113
02:32:23.191 --> 02:32:27.330
<v Speaker 4>present it as fact when it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have many times given this very simple</v>

3114
02:32:27.331 --> 02:32:29.300
<v Speaker 4>analogy of the telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3115
02:32:29.490 --> 02:32:32.670
<v Speaker 4>which I think explains the logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem in the materialist view.</v>

3116
02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:35.790
<v Speaker 4>If you want to look at a distant star </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your telescope,</v>

3117
02:32:35.791 --> 02:32:38.550
<v Speaker 4>you're going to point it at the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>area of the sky first of all,</v>

3118
02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 4>and then you're going to focus it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as you focus it,</v>

3119
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:46.550
<v Speaker 4>physical changes will take place in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the lenses inside </v>

3120
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:47.730
<v Speaker 4>the barrel of the telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3121
02:32:47.850 --> 02:32:48.760
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3122
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Eventually the star will come into view </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can see it clearly.</v>

3123
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:57.440
<v Speaker 4>You'd be completely wrong to say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the star is the physical changes inside </v>

3124
02:32:57.440 --> 02:32:57.440
<v Speaker 4>the barrel of the telescope.</v>

3125
02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Those physical changes have simply </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed you to see the star with my </v>

3126
02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:05.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the same idea with Dmt,</v>

3127
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:10.670
<v Speaker 4>that it's that it's changing brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>function to allow you to see something </v>

3128
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:13.881
<v Speaker 4>that you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's refocusing the brain in other </v>

3129
02:33:13.881 --> 02:33:13.881
<v Speaker 4>words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

3130
02:33:13.881 --> 02:33:15.750
<v Speaker 4>that's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting inquiry.</v>

3131
02:33:15.810 --> 02:33:17.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd never thought about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

3132
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Not Entirely and and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiments could be done to test that </v>

3133
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:23.910
<v Speaker 4>with human volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could.</v>

3134
02:33:23.911 --> 02:33:26.280
<v Speaker 4>You could begin to investigate if there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a freestanding reality,</v>

3135
02:33:26.281 --> 02:33:31.281
<v Speaker 4>then we ought to be able to get certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>information out of it that they should </v>

3136
02:33:31.281 --> 02:33:32.490
<v Speaker 4>be possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3137
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:36.540
<v Speaker 4>we always had just started as a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 4>gateway.</v>

3138
02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:41.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think this is a way better way of </v>

3139
02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:44.241
<v Speaker 4>explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of a telescope having to focus </v>

3140
02:33:44.241 --> 02:33:47.931
<v Speaker 4>in to see something and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals focusing you in that a </v>

3141
02:33:47.931 --> 02:33:50.340
<v Speaker 4>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own brain makes your brain makes it</v>

3142
02:33:50.370 --> 02:33:52.710
<v Speaker 4>focusing Ulan and perhaps for some very </v>
<v Speaker 4>good reason.</v>

3143
02:33:52.770 --> 02:33:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

3144
02:33:54.121 --> 02:33:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about that way before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it is,</v>

3145
02:33:59.070 --> 02:34:02.010
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty fucking profound and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone to comment on it,</v>

3146
02:34:02.011 --> 02:34:04.050
<v Speaker 4>that hasn't taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems kind of silly,</v>

3147
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:07.500
<v Speaker 4>especially because it's only 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>is disrespectful to speak of.</v>

3148
02:34:07.501 --> 02:34:12.501
<v Speaker 4>It too is it's fine to speak of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's disrespectful to put it down </v>

3149
02:34:12.501 --> 02:34:16.410
<v Speaker 4>without having had the guts actually to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the experience yourself.</v>

3150
02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:19.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think it's becoming more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more accepted though?</v>

3151
02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:24.240
<v Speaker 4>Because I think for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 4>academics resisted taking it or if they </v>

3152
02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:28.081
<v Speaker 4>did take it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it because they didn't </v>

3153
02:34:28.081 --> 02:34:28.510
<v Speaker 4>want to be labeled because there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people have that will label you.</v>

3154
02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:33.540
<v Speaker 4>If you talk about psychedelic recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been considered a career relenting </v>

3155
02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 4>move and I can talk very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though they all knew the news,</v>

3156
02:34:37.170 --> 02:34:41.020
<v Speaker 4>it'll knew the positive side of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is again gradually changing and</v>

3157
02:34:41.021 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the the American role,</v>

3158
02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:48.600
<v Speaker 4>the role of the American people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing the legal status of cannabis </v>

3159
02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:52.711
<v Speaker 4>state by state is also going to feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>into this and allow us to have a more </v>

3160
02:34:52.711 --> 02:34:53.620
<v Speaker 4>rational dialogue regarding </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

3161
02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:55.180
<v Speaker 4>which can be.</v>

3162
02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying to people yet go out and </v>

3163
02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:03.271
<v Speaker 4>take psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is that these are very </v>

3164
02:35:03.271 --> 02:35:06.751
<v Speaker 4>powerful agents and that they can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely healing used in the right way </v>

3165
02:35:07.850 --> 02:35:10.810
<v Speaker 4>and they can change our whole view of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

3166
02:35:10.811 --> 02:35:15.811
<v Speaker 4>Why should we be forbidden to explore </v>
<v Speaker 4>that if as responsible adults we choose </v>

3167
02:35:15.811 --> 02:35:16.740
<v Speaker 4>to do so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3168
02:35:16.770 --> 02:35:17.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3169
02:35:17.291 --> 02:35:22.291
<v Speaker 4>it's the argument is stupid and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>the argument is eventually going away </v>

3170
02:35:22.291 --> 02:35:26.790
<v Speaker 4>and I think it will be replaced by a new</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument and then the new argument is </v>

3171
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.790
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is really happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3172
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:31.530
<v Speaker 4>and your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it your question about it or your </v>

3173
02:35:31.530 --> 02:35:32.770
<v Speaker 4>proposal is vast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very fascinating one,</v>

3174
02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:37.980
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things are there and you can </v>

3175
02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:39.040
<v Speaker 4>benefit from them or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's up to you,</v>

3176
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:44.070
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the fact that we live in a world </v>

3177
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.070
<v Speaker 4>where those are illegal is is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is crazy,</v>

3178
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:48.520
<v Speaker 4>it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if people are having very bad </v>

3179
02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:48.520
<v Speaker 4>experiences from time to time with </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

3180
02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:53.340
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason for that is the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've created where these are illegal </v>

3181
02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:55.720
<v Speaker 4>and where it's impossible for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get good advice that they can trust them</v>

3182
02:35:55.721 --> 02:35:58.300
<v Speaker 4>with as this atmosphere of danger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>threat that surrounds it.</v>

3183
02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Take all that away and this very </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful instrument can be managed much </v>

3184
02:36:03.851 --> 02:36:04.740
<v Speaker 4>more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3185
02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:05.590
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt,</v>

3186
02:36:05.591 --> 02:36:08.010
<v Speaker 4>and I equate it a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3187
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:13.070
<v Speaker 4>this idea of it being bad and negative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acquainted a lot of ways to vaccinations</v>

3188
02:36:13.571 --> 02:36:18.571
<v Speaker 4>and here's why there's this vaccination </v>
<v Speaker 4>is anti vaccination movement in this </v>

3189
02:36:18.571 --> 02:36:22.501
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people feel like vaccinations </v>

3190
02:36:22.501 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 4>are unnecessary and they may have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>good arguments.</v>

3191
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:28.830
<v Speaker 4>They may have some good arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially about some certain </v>

3192
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:29.050
<v Speaker 4>vaccinations for things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually transmitted,</v>

3193
02:36:29.051 --> 02:36:32.140
<v Speaker 4>diseases and things along those lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hepatitis shots and shit.</v>

3194
02:36:32.141 --> 02:36:37.141
<v Speaker 4>You're given a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a real good argument against </v>

3195
02:36:37.141 --> 02:36:40.891
<v Speaker 4>that and there's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely an argument that </v>

3196
02:36:40.891 --> 02:36:43.270
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of medication the kids are</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking and is it the right amount,</v>

3197
02:36:43.690 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's no argument that </v>
<v Speaker 4>vaccinations haven't saved a fuck ton of</v>

3198
02:36:48.341 --> 02:36:49.540
<v Speaker 4>lives because they have.</v>

3199
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:52.390
<v Speaker 4>They've stopped a lot of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Data and attract.</v>

3200
02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they also,</v>

3201
02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:57.520
<v Speaker 4>much like we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are allergic to cats,</v>

3202
02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:02.790
<v Speaker 4>some people are very different </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological reactions to all sorts of </v>

3203
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:03.110
<v Speaker 4>different chemicals and there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be some adverse reactions.</v>

3204
02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Something in your body that I absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree that the vaccination is incredibly</v>

3205
02:37:07.811 --> 02:37:12.811
<v Speaker 4>effective medical tool in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there also is a kind of vaccination </v>

3206
02:37:12.811 --> 02:37:16.561
<v Speaker 4>mafia because they are the ultimate mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication and people are making money.</v>

3207
02:37:16.750 --> 02:37:19.220
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt there's whenever </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's profits,</v>

3208
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:21.230
<v Speaker 4>there's fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no getting around it.</v>

3209
02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Just the way he even being side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the.</v>

3210
02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3211
02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:31.060
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those scenarios very much </v>
<v Speaker 4>like psychedelics in a way that the are </v>

3212
02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:34.220
<v Speaker 4>going to be some rare cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we make psychedelics legal across the</v>

3213
02:37:34.221 --> 02:37:36.020
<v Speaker 4>board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be some rare cases of a</v>

3214
02:37:36.021 --> 02:37:41.021
<v Speaker 4>person in a bad state of mind or a bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental makeup or what have you.</v>

3215
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Pad psychological makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can fill in the blanks where they </v>

3216
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:48.821
<v Speaker 4>take it and it's detrimental to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen and that'll be </v>

3217
02:37:48.821 --> 02:37:51.941
<v Speaker 4>highly publicized and used as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument to stop all of these freedoms </v>

3218
02:37:51.941 --> 02:37:55.010
<v Speaker 4>and building access is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have the very best answer to that as I'm</v>

3219
02:37:55.011 --> 02:37:56.730
<v Speaker 4>sure as I'm sure you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>

3220
02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:57.200
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3221
02:37:57.230 --> 02:38:01.400
<v Speaker 4>the lunatic who leaps out of the window </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he can fly on Lsd.</v>

3222
02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't the fucker try and take off </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the ground?</v>

3223
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:06.250
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we lost a moron.</v>

3224
02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:08.600
<v Speaker 4>The world got lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3225
02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:11.450
<v Speaker 4>World got lighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite lines.</v>

3226
02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

3227
02:38:13.011 --> 02:38:15.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

3228
02:38:15.021 --> 02:38:16.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3229
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:22.750
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a strange argument to keep </v>

3230
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.790
<v Speaker 4>people from doing it because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially like this doctor that we were</v>

3231
02:38:22.791 --> 02:38:27.791
<v Speaker 4>talking about earlier that's talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about cannabis in the addictive </v>

3232
02:38:27.791 --> 02:38:30.551
<v Speaker 4>properties of cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this isn't even talking to someone </v>

3233
02:38:30.551 --> 02:38:31.170
<v Speaker 4>who was addicted to cannabis and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still,</v>

3234
02:38:31.370 --> 02:38:33.200
<v Speaker 4>it's a silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

3235
02:38:33.201 --> 02:38:35.000
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot going on when someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted.</v>

3236
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:40.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not all necessarily chemical and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones that are chemical you're </v>

3237
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:41.180
<v Speaker 4>getting paid for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that doesn't even make any sense.</v>

3238
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:46.270
<v Speaker 4>The ones that chemically make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted as the ones you're getting </v>

3239
02:38:46.270 --> 02:38:49.151
<v Speaker 4>money from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are fed up with all of this shit </v>

3240
02:38:49.151 --> 02:38:51.791
<v Speaker 4>because it's so corrupt and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong and it's time that is time that a </v>

3241
02:38:51.791 --> 02:38:54.851
<v Speaker 4>new direction was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are people who are on the </v>

3242
02:38:54.851 --> 02:38:54.851
<v Speaker 4>wrong side of history on this and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be.</v>

3243
02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:57.710
<v Speaker 4>But we are moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are as well.</v>

3244
02:38:57.711 --> 02:38:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3245
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.970
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool to see too.</v>

3246
02:39:01.090 --> 02:39:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3247
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:06.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also important that a guy </v>

3248
02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:07.280
<v Speaker 4>like you who smoked pot from 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>AM to 2:00</v>

3249
02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:08.660
<v Speaker 4>AM every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven days a week,</v>

3250
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:10.920
<v Speaker 4>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>365 days a week,</v>

3251
02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:13.100
<v Speaker 4>going to enormous length to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>obtain it.</v>

3252
02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:18.100
<v Speaker 4>When I was traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was that of sources that it is,</v>

3253
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:20.690
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3254
02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:22.730
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do know what I'm talking about.</v>

3255
02:39:22.731 --> 02:39:25.230
<v Speaker 4>I had a long relationship with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

3256
02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.910
<v Speaker 4>I understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel now having good dip back</v>

3257
02:39:28.911 --> 02:39:29.810
<v Speaker 4>in the water?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little bit.</v>

3258
02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:32.660
<v Speaker 4>I feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't feel any urge to become that</v>

3259
02:39:32.661 --> 02:39:35.120
<v Speaker 4>guy again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My clarity,</v>

3260
02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3261
02:39:35.970 --> 02:39:40.010
<v Speaker 4>I was able to write with cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but since I stopped smoking cannabis,</v>

3262
02:39:40.011 --> 02:39:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I've been clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mind has been a clarity.</v>

3263
02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:46.880
<v Speaker 4>So there's a certain fog was lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fog wouldn't have been there if I'd</v>

3264
02:39:46.881 --> 02:39:51.881
<v Speaker 4>had one joint at the weekend and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was all but it since I was smoking all </v>

3265
02:39:51.881 --> 02:39:51.881
<v Speaker 4>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it was there.</v>

3266
02:39:51.881 --> 02:39:52.770
<v Speaker 4>It's nice not to have that felt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3267
02:39:52.970 --> 02:39:54.230
<v Speaker 4>go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel more productive.</v>

3268
02:39:54.231 --> 02:39:56.450
<v Speaker 4>I write my novels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can write 5,000</v>

3269
02:39:56.451 --> 02:39:58.680
<v Speaker 4>words a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I'd get sucked the zone,</v>

3270
02:39:58.681 --> 02:40:00.490
<v Speaker 4>so into the flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3271
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:05.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that all that is good and I feel I feel </v>

3272
02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:08.081
<v Speaker 4>good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think field probably in the long </v>

3273
02:40:08.081 --> 02:40:08.900
<v Speaker 4>run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my right choice would not be have a big,</v>

3274
02:40:08.930 --> 02:40:11.090
<v Speaker 4>have a big relationship with cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've done that.</v>

3275
02:40:11.091 --> 02:40:12.260
<v Speaker 4>Been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done that.</v>

3276
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Know I've got the t shirt.</v>

3277
02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:16.200
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tool.</v>

3278
02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't use the same tool every day is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes I'll use any tools,</v>

3279
02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:25.160
<v Speaker 1>need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a pretty profound effect a </v>

3280
02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:25.160
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3281
02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:29.340
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite things to do is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night get high and go down to the beach </v>

3282
02:40:29.610 --> 02:40:32.010
<v Speaker 1>and stare at the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to love doing that.</v>

3283
02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think freaks me out when I'm high.</v>

3284
02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:35.910
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're this,</v>

3285
02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:38.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a monster.</v>

3286
02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a living thing almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a force.</v>

3287
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a nature force that doesn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck about you.</v>

3288
02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one reason why like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that live by the beach or so </v>

3289
02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3290
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:53.460
<v Speaker 1>The beach communities are notoriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>mellow.</v>

3291
02:40:53.490 --> 02:40:58.490
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think one of the reasons why </v>

3292
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:59.520
<v Speaker 1>they're notoriously Melo is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're faced with overwhelming evidence</v>

3293
02:40:59.521 --> 02:41:00.630
<v Speaker 1>that day ain't shit.</v>

3294
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there looking out at the </v>

3295
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:08.130
<v Speaker 1>greatest like natural force that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could imagine.</v>

3296
02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:10.950
<v Speaker 1>It's an entire different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out there.</v>

3297
02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we had explained it in a </v>

3298
02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:18.811
<v Speaker 1>galactic term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like your parking yourself </v>

3299
02:41:18.811 --> 02:41:22.041
<v Speaker 1>next to the membrane between dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are literally in this world </v>

3300
02:41:22.141 --> 02:41:26.580
<v Speaker 1>over here and right next to your face is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole nother world.</v>

3301
02:41:26.850 --> 02:41:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Like we couldn't even imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the fuck exactly what it is.</v>

3302
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to Santa Monica and you </v>

3303
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:36.390
<v Speaker 1>go over by where that peer as and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just walk along that sand and just start</v>

3304
02:41:36.391 --> 02:41:41.391
<v Speaker 1>walking out into that water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in another world in like 20 </v>

3305
02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:44.661
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're and you're over your head and </v>

3306
02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:44.661
<v Speaker 1>you're in another dimension that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't survive in.</v>

3307
02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:47.340
<v Speaker 1>But to get the fuck back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like you went to another</v>

3308
02:41:47.341 --> 02:41:52.341
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might as well have gone to </v>

3309
02:41:52.341 --> 02:41:52.341
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

3310
02:41:52.341 --> 02:41:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of</v>

3311
02:41:52.470 --> 02:41:57.470
<v Speaker 3>my strongest experiences of diving was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to tell a little story,</v>

3312
02:41:57.631 --> 02:42:00.690
<v Speaker 3>was dieting it off a tenor reef in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Canary Islands.</v>

3313
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:04.440
<v Speaker 3>And I was down at a good 20 meters under</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

3314
02:42:04.441 --> 02:42:09.441
<v Speaker 3>let's say 70 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was a storm that day and the </v>

3315
02:42:09.441 --> 02:42:13.680
<v Speaker 3>huge swell on the surface was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful that it was smashing me against</v>

3316
02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:15.340
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

3317
02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

3318
02:42:16.650 --> 02:42:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>

3319
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.980
<v Speaker 3>that moment I realized I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the hands of a gigantic force,</v>

3320
02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:27.540
<v Speaker 3>but I can do absolutely nothing about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do the sea,</v>

3321
02:42:27.541 --> 02:42:32.541
<v Speaker 3>the sea for me is a goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately I got over a lip and down </v>

3322
02:42:32.641 --> 02:42:35.220
<v Speaker 3>into deeper water and it was okay for </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

3323
02:42:35.250 --> 02:42:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another 10 feet is what the fuck man.</v>

3324
02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:41.550
<v Speaker 3>How long did you have to wait it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another story.</v>

3325
02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stayed down for about 20,</v>

3326
02:42:44.881 --> 02:42:47.250
<v Speaker 3>25 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We then had to have to come up.</v>

3327
02:42:47.251 --> 02:42:49.440
<v Speaker 3>We'd been working quite hard at depth </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get through,</v>

3328
02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:54.441
<v Speaker 3>you get through your Ehr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we hadn't done was recky the </v>

3329
02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:59.510
<v Speaker 3>exit point and when we surfaced in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy swell,</v>

3330
02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:02.010
<v Speaker 3>it was extremely difficult to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sea.</v>

3331
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:05.920
<v Speaker 3>The rocks came down quite steep and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed this before you.</v>

3332
02:43:05.921 --> 02:43:08.670
<v Speaker 3>You came up at a different spot and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was bad.</v>

3333
02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.350
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I am,</v>

3334
02:43:10.351 --> 02:43:12.190
<v Speaker 3>I will tell the tale and</v>

3335
02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.920
<v Speaker 1>an older and wiser man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Fitzsimmons is a terrifying.</v>

3336
02:43:14.921 --> 02:43:16.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a good buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very funny.</v>

3337
02:43:16.271 --> 02:43:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Standup comedian has a terrifying story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on vacation.</v>

3338
02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:23.820
<v Speaker 1>He saw a woman drowning and he went out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to save her and he realized that was </v>

3339
02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:25.590
<v Speaker 1>hanging onto this woman's swim in back </v>
<v Speaker 1>while his kids and his wife and everyone</v>

3340
02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:26.950
<v Speaker 1>was on the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3341
02:43:26.951 --> 02:43:31.951
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm trying to save someone hear </v>

3342
02:43:31.951 --> 02:43:31.951
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when people try to say people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get drowned.</v>

3343
02:43:31.951 --> 02:43:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I know happens often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens often.</v>

3344
02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3345
02:43:35.130 --> 02:43:37.450
<v Speaker 1>He said that the tide was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>too strong.</v>

3346
02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Who's really spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rip Tide.</v>

3347
02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:41.750
<v Speaker 1>The sea is something to respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

3348
02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something fast I had is that's a </v>

3349
02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:49.291
<v Speaker 1>terrifying thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's my favorite thing to one of </v>

3350
02:43:49.291 --> 02:43:50.680
<v Speaker 1>my favorite things to do at the beach </v>
<v Speaker 1>late at night by myself.</v>

3351
02:43:50.681 --> 02:43:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Smoke a spliff.</v>

3352
02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Just stand out there and stare it by </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

3353
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Puts everything in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

3354
02:43:56.501 --> 02:43:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ultimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very psych,</v>

3355
02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:01.900
<v Speaker 1>not just like a duck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very isolation tank.</v>

3356
02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Ask in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an overwhelming amount of </v>

3357
02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:09.511
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's solitude and the sound and </v>

3358
02:44:09.511 --> 02:44:13.591
<v Speaker 1>the noise that sort of drowns out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world doesn't totally drown </v>

3359
02:44:13.591 --> 02:44:17.311
<v Speaker 1>it out like an isolation tank does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a partial effect because you </v>

3360
02:44:17.311 --> 02:44:21.391
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moving but semi static image </v>

3361
02:44:21.391 --> 02:44:23.530
<v Speaker 1>because it's these water waves that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at you and they're very similar,</v>

3362
02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:28.660
<v Speaker 1>so get in this very similar thing over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again with very little </v>

3363
02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:29.290
<v Speaker 1>variation and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming number,</v>

3364
02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the gallons of water that's just so in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you so you can't see past this </v>

3365
02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing and it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then there's the unknown,</v>

3366
02:44:38.290 --> 02:44:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the big freaker.</v>

3367
02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Know you're looking out this black </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster and sometimes when it's this </v>

3368
02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:47.581
<v Speaker 1>black monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a better sense of it than when </v>

3369
02:44:47.581 --> 02:44:48.040
<v Speaker 1>it's this beautiful blue thing during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day when the sun's hitting it.</v>

3370
02:44:48.041 --> 02:44:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It's reflecting because you need to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this visual stuff that's distracting</v>

3371
02:44:51.371 --> 02:44:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you from the fact that south Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>water giant fuck load of water.</v>

3372
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he could just go,</v>

3373
02:44:57.820 --> 02:44:58.750
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3374
02:44:58.810 --> 02:45:03.810
<v Speaker 1>just come in like this and you're gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything's gone like a thousand </v>

3375
02:45:03.810 --> 02:45:06.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking feet high waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened before.</v>

3376
02:45:06.770 --> 02:45:06.970
<v Speaker 1>As</v>

3377
02:45:06.970 --> 02:45:11.970
<v Speaker 3>has happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also part of the new research </v>

3378
02:45:11.970 --> 02:45:16.031
<v Speaker 3>that I'm doing and I'm about to do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip with randall cardinal crosses being</v>

3379
02:45:16.430 --> 02:45:17.660
<v Speaker 3>on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love Him.</v>

3380
02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3381
02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:23.520
<v Speaker 3>randall was so far ahead of the curve in</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that the gigantic flooding </v>

3382
02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:27.641
<v Speaker 3>that came off the North American ice cap</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't just caused by what I used to </v>

3383
02:45:27.641 --> 02:45:31.760
<v Speaker 3>think it was caused by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that lakes of meltwater develop</v>

3384
02:45:31.761 --> 02:45:33.350
<v Speaker 3>on the surface of the ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>

3385
02:45:33.351 --> 02:45:38.351
<v Speaker 3>the dam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dam breaks and the melt water pours </v>

3386
02:45:38.351 --> 02:45:38.570
<v Speaker 3>out randomly pointing out for years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3387
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:43.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the water flows were much too </v>

3388
02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:43.590
<v Speaker 3>radical for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something much bigger.</v>

3389
02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:47.631
<v Speaker 3>I had to be had to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was well ahead of the evidence </v>

3390
02:45:47.631 --> 02:45:51.701
<v Speaker 3>when scientists began to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the North American ice cap had been hit </v>

3391
02:45:51.701 --> 02:45:53.750
<v Speaker 3>by a comet 12,980</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

3392
02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:55.400
<v Speaker 3>It was set in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the epoch,</v>

3393
02:45:55.401 --> 02:45:57.940
<v Speaker 3>the geologist called the younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So run.</v>

3394
02:45:57.941 --> 02:46:00.100
<v Speaker 3>And so randall is a great expert in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3395
02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:02.630
<v Speaker 3>in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife's sent this traveling with us as</v>

3396
02:46:02.631 --> 02:46:07.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a friend of Randall's who's worked </v>

3397
02:46:07.631 --> 02:46:10.211
<v Speaker 3>with him for many years called Bradley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to do a road trip from </v>

3398
02:46:10.211 --> 02:46:10.211
<v Speaker 3>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon,</v>

3399
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:12.670
<v Speaker 4>all the way to Minneapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3400
02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:14.570
<v Speaker 4>following the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about 2000 miles,</v>

3401
02:46:14.571 --> 02:46:19.571
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>following the southern edge of the </v>

3402
02:46:19.571 --> 02:46:19.700
<v Speaker 4>former ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Randall's going to show us the scars</v>

3403
02:46:19.701 --> 02:46:23.150
<v Speaker 4>and tears on the landscape of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened when that ice cap was instantly</v>

3404
02:46:23.151 --> 02:46:28.151
<v Speaker 4>liquidized by a comet impact and huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>tidal waves of water roared down,</v>

3405
02:46:28.731 --> 02:46:29.730
<v Speaker 4>off it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>across the land.</v>

3406
02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to see that,</v>

3407
02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:32.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3408
02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:34.160
<v Speaker 4>in detail with Randall Real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking forward to doing that.</v>

3409
02:46:34.161 --> 02:46:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Also the first time I've ever crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3410
02:46:36.651 --> 02:46:38.690
<v Speaker 4>most of America by road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3411
02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:41.480
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certain spots shouldn't stop.</v>

3412
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:44.900
<v Speaker 4>If you feel like you're in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in danger.</v>

3413
02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Get in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit the gas.</v>

3414
02:46:46.211 --> 02:46:51.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you do you know what country </v>

3415
02:46:51.211 --> 02:46:51.211
<v Speaker 4>music is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to listen to some of that.</v>

3416
02:46:51.211 --> 02:46:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Gets a hold of some country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to fit in,</v>

3417
02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:52.400
<v Speaker 4>you got to blend in.</v>

3418
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:57.730
<v Speaker 4>Can you fake southern accent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if they think you're from the </v>

3419
02:46:57.730 --> 02:46:57.730
<v Speaker 4>England,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do my best.</v>

3420
02:46:57.730 --> 02:47:02.180
<v Speaker 4>But from the angland they won't like him</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want to get very upset if you </v>

3421
02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:02.940
<v Speaker 4>go down better knows what are you dr </v>
<v Speaker 4>who.</v>

3422
02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:07.190
<v Speaker 4>The funny thing is in England,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often get mistaken for an American.</v>

3423
02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3424
02:47:08.890 --> 02:47:11.420
<v Speaker 4>You here nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's in any doubt once I am,</v>

3425
02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:13.310
<v Speaker 4>but in England I'm officer American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3426
02:47:13.311 --> 02:47:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Or sometimes Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3427
02:47:16.310 --> 02:47:20.960
<v Speaker 4>Canada has a bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a certain amount of English</v>

3428
02:47:20.961 --> 02:47:25.961
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they talk about things in a </v>

3429
02:47:25.961 --> 02:47:25.961
<v Speaker 4>certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3430
02:47:25.961 --> 02:47:28.610
<v Speaker 4>clear variation between them and us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there is definitely I even,</v>

3431
02:47:28.611 --> 02:47:30.720
<v Speaker 4>I can hear that and I've got a 10 year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I,</v>

3432
02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:32.030
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hear that too?</v>

3433
02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can totally telecommute Canadian after</v>

3434
02:47:35.271 --> 02:47:36.170
<v Speaker 4>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

3435
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:37.280
<v Speaker 4>So similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3436
02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:38.660
<v Speaker 4>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very similar.</v>

3437
02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:41.280
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious that anybody would ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>think you're American.</v>

3438
02:47:41.281 --> 02:47:42.140
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3439
02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be great.</v>

3440
02:47:43.491 --> 02:47:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm really looking forward to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy.</v>

3441
02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:49.810
<v Speaker 4>That sounds fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take loads and loads of </v>

3442
02:47:49.810 --> 02:47:51.881
<v Speaker 4>pictures and we're going to go up in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>airplane a few times and look at the </v>

3443
02:47:51.881 --> 02:47:52.190
<v Speaker 4>look at the land underneath us and is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a great,</v>

3444
02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:57.370
<v Speaker 4>exciting research trip and it's the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>research trip for this cul that I'm </v>

3445
02:47:57.370 --> 02:48:00.491
<v Speaker 4>writing to fingerprints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've seen this most recent </v>

3446
02:48:00.491 --> 02:48:00.580
<v Speaker 4>discovery about micro diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3447
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:02.870
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's precisely.</v>

3448
02:48:02.871 --> 02:48:05.360
<v Speaker 4>That is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has finally settled it.</v>

3449
02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Any scientists who were attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>argue that there wasn't a comedy impact.</v>

3450
02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all the evidence that's come in </v>

3451
02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:16.571
<v Speaker 4>over the last five or six years is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>settled by the nano diamonds scattered </v>

3452
02:48:16.571 --> 02:48:18.350
<v Speaker 4>in a huge swathe all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are assure,</v>

3453
02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:21.440
<v Speaker 4>a chemical imprint of a massive comet </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact,</v>

3454
02:48:21.770 --> 02:48:24.110
<v Speaker 4>and they know a lot about it.</v>

3455
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really very,</v>

3456
02:48:25.731 --> 02:48:28.310
<v Speaker 4>very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was an episode that changed the</v>

3457
02:48:28.311 --> 02:48:29.150
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3458
02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:32.660
<v Speaker 4>it killed off the many of the megafauna </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've all heard of,</v>

3459
02:48:32.661 --> 02:48:34.880
<v Speaker 4>the mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woody rhinos and so on and so forth,</v>

3460
02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:39.200
<v Speaker 4>and it got rid of what was called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clovis culture.</v>

3461
02:48:39.201 --> 02:48:40.730
<v Speaker 4>A hunter gather a culture in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

3462
02:48:40.850 --> 02:48:45.850
<v Speaker 4>And I think it got rid of a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization that we've only remembered </v>

3463
02:48:45.850 --> 02:48:49.571
<v Speaker 4>in myth and memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least that's the line that I'm </v>

3464
02:48:49.571 --> 02:48:50.290
<v Speaker 4>investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating line,</v>

3465
02:48:50.300 --> 02:48:55.300
<v Speaker 4>especially when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as each visit that you come back to the </v>

3466
02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:55.430
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's new information.</v>

3467
02:48:55.710 --> 02:49:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Last time it was the nuclear glass that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they discovered when they were doing </v>

3468
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:01.160
<v Speaker 4>core samples again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about 12,000</v>

3469
02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:01.940
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3470
02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:03.930
<v Speaker 4>And then the new one is this micro </v>
<v Speaker 4>diamonds.</v>

3471
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:07.100
<v Speaker 4>It seems like over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not.</v>

3472
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 4>It becomes not a possibility,</v>

3473
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:10.200
<v Speaker 3>but a reality that there was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an impact,</v>

3474
02:49:10.201 --> 02:49:12.830
<v Speaker 3>something gigantic happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all over the world and right.</v>

3475
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:16.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was massive in America,</v>

3476
02:49:16.561 --> 02:49:21.561
<v Speaker 3>but it was the effect was everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both impacts because this comment broke </v>

3477
02:49:21.561 --> 02:49:21.990
<v Speaker 3>up into fragments like she would make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>levy nine,</v>

3478
02:49:22.290 --> 02:49:25.920
<v Speaker 3>both impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also very important,</v>

3479
02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:29.400
<v Speaker 3>the gigantic cloud of dust that's thrown</v>
<v Speaker 3>up into the upper atmosphere,</v>

3480
02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:34.640
<v Speaker 3>which then so you have this immediate </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction of flooding as the comment </v>

3481
02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:34.770
<v Speaker 3>liquidiser as part of the North American</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice cap.</v>

3482
02:49:34.771 --> 02:49:38.790
<v Speaker 3>And then a huge dust plume is up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air all over the world.</v>

3483
02:49:38.791 --> 02:49:43.560
<v Speaker 3>And the whole earth is shrouded in dust </v>
<v Speaker 3>as cool and cool because it's reflecting</v>

3484
02:49:43.561 --> 02:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>back the sun's rays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we go into this 1,300,</v>

3485
02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:51.750
<v Speaker 3>1000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 year period called the younger </v>

3486
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3487
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:55.010
<v Speaker 3>where the earth gets incredibly cold </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though previously it had been </v>

3488
02:49:55.010 --> 02:49:58.161
<v Speaker 3>coming out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the ice is truly are gigantic </v>

3489
02:49:58.161 --> 02:49:58.161
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

3490
02:49:58.161 --> 02:49:58.740
<v Speaker 3>And then weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all our history,</v>

3491
02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:03.800
<v Speaker 3>everything we think of as our past </v>
<v Speaker 3>begins at the end of the younger dryas </v>

3492
02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:05.880
<v Speaker 3>around it kicks in 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>980 years ago,</v>

3493
02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:07.560
<v Speaker 3>ends 11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 years ago.</v>

3494
02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:12.770
<v Speaker 3>The Earth begins to want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>begins to warm up again and everything </v>

3495
02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:15.210
<v Speaker 3>we know about ourselves or can claim we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know unfolds in that last 11,000,</v>

3496
02:50:15.211 --> 02:50:17.790
<v Speaker 3>600 years and the period before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger dryas,</v>

3497
02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:20.880
<v Speaker 3>we really blank on so much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating.</v>

3498
02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:21.900
<v Speaker 3>I send it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3499
02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:26.940
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that all this information </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps coming up to support this.</v>

3500
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we do consider the possibility that </v>

3501
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:35.151
<v Speaker 3>it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everything can be essentially shut </v>

3502
02:50:35.151 --> 02:50:38.301
<v Speaker 3>back down to zero with some rocks from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky and that that's something that </v>

3503
02:50:38.301 --> 02:50:40.720
<v Speaker 3>we really need to get in our head that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could happen there.</v>

3504
02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:44.070
<v Speaker 3>There is a very distinct possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we could be hit by something.</v>

3505
02:50:44.850 --> 02:50:48.150
<v Speaker 3>The NASA photographs of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they call it the black diamond,</v>

3506
02:50:48.151 --> 02:50:48.960
<v Speaker 3>the earth at night.</v>

3507
02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you see is certain areas of the </v>

3508
02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:56.940
<v Speaker 3>world a brightly lit up Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North America for example,</v>

3509
02:50:57.660 --> 02:51:02.660
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and large parts of South America </v>

3510
02:51:02.660 --> 02:51:06.950
<v Speaker 3>are dark because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrification in those areas and those</v>

3511
02:51:07.051 --> 02:51:11.640
<v Speaker 3>photographs are often taken to say to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak of our achievement,</v>

3512
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:13.580
<v Speaker 3>look how we can light up the planet like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3513
02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:18.820
<v Speaker 3>like a Christmas tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that it can be viewed from viewed </v>

3514
02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:22.011
<v Speaker 3>from space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say it also says another </v>

3515
02:51:22.011 --> 02:51:24.831
<v Speaker 3>thing that if we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were to confront again the same </v>

3516
02:51:24.831 --> 02:51:27.240
<v Speaker 3>sort of cataclysm that hit the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000,</v>

3517
02:51:27.241 --> 02:51:32.241
<v Speaker 3>980 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the people who would survive and </v>

3518
02:51:32.241 --> 02:51:35.841
<v Speaker 3>carry the human story forward would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>those very people who live in the dark </v>

3519
02:51:35.841 --> 02:51:37.020
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the areas that aren't electrified.</v>

3520
02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:42.170
<v Speaker 3>And we who live in the glowing lights </v>
<v Speaker 3>that show up on those NASA photographs </v>

3521
02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:48.100
<v Speaker 3>who've become so specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who most of us are unable even to know </v>

3522
02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:48.300
<v Speaker 3>how to plant a vegetable or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3523
02:51:48.301 --> 02:51:50.670
<v Speaker 3>or hunt an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the ones who would,</v>

3524
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:52.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be gone and the whole order of</v>

3525
02:51:52.651 --> 02:51:55.680
<v Speaker 3>the world would be reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3526
02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:57.960
<v Speaker 3>So the world would become like an Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oscar culture.</v>

3527
02:51:57.961 --> 02:51:59.970
<v Speaker 3>You'd have all these fucking people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon.</v>

3528
02:51:59.971 --> 02:52:02.070
<v Speaker 3>That would be fine because they're fed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fine,</v>

3529
02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:04.560
<v Speaker 3>they'd be absolutely fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know how to survive,</v>

3530
02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:05.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know,</v>

3531
02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 3>they know how</v>

3532
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:07.450
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

3533
02:52:07.451 --> 02:52:12.451
<v Speaker 4>I think the message of this is we </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be arrogant and complacent in </v>

3534
02:52:12.451 --> 02:52:15.961
<v Speaker 4>the achievements of our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have done wonderful and amazing </v>

3535
02:52:15.961 --> 02:52:18.721
<v Speaker 4>things as well as terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we shouldn't be arrogant or </v>

3536
02:52:18.721 --> 02:52:22.111
<v Speaker 4>complacent about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should recognize it's all very </v>

3537
02:52:22.111 --> 02:52:22.111
<v Speaker 4>fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be taken away from us at anytime.</v>

3538
02:52:22.111 --> 02:52:24.520
<v Speaker 4>We can take it away from ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt.</v>

3539
02:52:24.521 --> 02:52:26.230
<v Speaker 4>The information is something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>consider.</v>

3540
02:52:26.290 --> 02:52:30.460
<v Speaker 4>Just the information about these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these impacts.</v>

3541
02:52:30.970 --> 02:52:35.970
<v Speaker 4>It's something to consider and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 4>something to consider that if that's </v>

3542
02:52:35.970 --> 02:52:39.691
<v Speaker 4>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for what a magical time it must have </v>

3543
02:52:39.691 --> 02:52:42.631
<v Speaker 4>been back when they had developed some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of technology that was enabling </v>

3544
02:52:43.961 --> 02:52:48.961
<v Speaker 4>them to make structures like go Beckley </v>
<v Speaker 4>tap is why I'm magicians of the gods </v>

3545
02:52:48.961 --> 02:52:52.330
<v Speaker 4>because there's something magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something about it that we would,</v>

3546
02:52:52.390 --> 02:52:57.310
<v Speaker 4>we would call magic perhaps was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>another another form of science.</v>

3547
02:52:57.430 --> 02:52:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3548
02:52:57.740 --> 02:52:59.860
<v Speaker 4>whatever they were able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3549
02:52:59.890 --> 02:53:01.900
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that we haven't figured it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out yet,</v>

3550
02:53:01.901 --> 02:53:06.901
<v Speaker 4>but we're so arrogant in our assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it had to be all the ways that </v>

3551
02:53:06.901 --> 02:53:08.140
<v Speaker 4>we've already figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so silly,</v>

3552
02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:11.730
<v Speaker 4>like isn't there some shit we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out exactly like this new,</v>

3553
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:16.830
<v Speaker 4>this new ability to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've just found out that they've </v>

3554
02:53:16.830 --> 02:53:19.860
<v Speaker 4>taken people and they've used the </v>
<v Speaker 4>internet to send information for more </v>

3555
02:53:19.860 --> 02:53:20.590
<v Speaker 4>person's mind or another person saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that 5,000</v>

3556
02:53:20.591 --> 02:53:22.240
<v Speaker 4>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible,</v>

3557
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:25.900
<v Speaker 4>but nobody else did that before that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we didn't really think that that was.</v>

3558
02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:28.390
<v Speaker 4>We thought maybe it'd be a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we know it's possibility.</v>

3559
02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck they did to make these</v>
<v Speaker 4>pyramids like just because we haven't </v>

3560
02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:37.591
<v Speaker 4>figured it out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that we're using wooden </v>

3561
02:53:37.591 --> 02:53:39.721
<v Speaker 4>rollers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they could have had some really </v>

3562
02:53:39.721 --> 02:53:40.130
<v Speaker 4>incredible technology that we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a trace of it anymore.</v>

3563
02:53:40.130 --> 02:53:45.130
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at a full of technology </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we don't recognize as exactly </v>

3564
02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:45.910
<v Speaker 4>because we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're programmed thinking about entirely</v>

3565
02:53:45.911 --> 02:53:50.911
<v Speaker 4>on our own terms and it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe is giving us a puzzle that </v>

3566
02:53:50.911 --> 02:53:55.711
<v Speaker 4>so incredibly in your face with its most</v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious results and because because we </v>

3567
02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:03.961
<v Speaker 4>have these preconceived notions that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not willing to accept that as a </v>

3568
02:54:03.961 --> 02:54:05.170
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when people look at the pyramids,</v>

3569
02:54:05.171 --> 02:54:05.710
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3570
02:54:05.890 --> 02:54:10.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is they build ramps and they </v>

3571
02:54:10.890 --> 02:54:12.490
<v Speaker 4>use stone rowers and like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole faction who will look for the most</v>

3572
02:54:12.491 --> 02:54:14.510
<v Speaker 4>boring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningless might've,</v>

3573
02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:16.800
<v Speaker 4>but they might've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they might've done that.</v>

3574
02:54:16.810 --> 02:54:21.810
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that that there are large </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups of people whose mission is to </v>

3575
02:54:21.810 --> 02:54:23.110
<v Speaker 4>look for the most boring rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most extraordinary possibility.</v>

3576
02:54:23.230 --> 02:54:25.750
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how we have bonds in our society.</v>

3577
02:54:25.751 --> 02:54:26.770
<v Speaker 4>We do need to look.</v>

3578
02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.800
<v Speaker 4>We do need to look with a skeptical eye </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say that there could be mundane </v>

3579
02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:33.160
<v Speaker 4>explanations for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we also need to keep a tiny fraction</v>

3580
02:54:33.161 --> 02:54:38.161
<v Speaker 4>of our research effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps a very small fraction indeed to </v>

3581
02:54:38.161 --> 02:54:42.410
<v Speaker 4>exploring alternative alternative ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because every night if they do come out </v>

3582
02:54:42.410 --> 02:54:46.741
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they change everything in the way that </v>

3583
02:54:46.741 --> 02:54:49.381
<v Speaker 4>the mundane things don't and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile and the only thing I'm </v>

3584
02:54:49.381 --> 02:54:52.960
<v Speaker 4>understand why I've been subjected to so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much criticism and I welcome it,</v>

3585
02:54:52.961 --> 02:54:56.170
<v Speaker 4>I've I've learnt a great deal from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism,</v>

3586
02:54:56.230 --> 02:55:01.230
<v Speaker 4>but is it wise for us to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>society which is hostile to the </v>

3587
02:55:01.230 --> 02:55:02.920
<v Speaker 4>exploration of extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities?</v>

3588
02:55:02.930 --> 02:55:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't we actually protect</v>

3589
02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:09.220
<v Speaker 1>that and make that something which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we encourage those who wish to do </v>

3590
02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:13.391
<v Speaker 1>so in our society to do just on the off </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance that they might come up with </v>

3591
02:55:13.391 --> 02:55:17.021
<v Speaker 1>something utterly world changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's done with careful </v>

3592
02:55:17.021 --> 02:55:20.111
<v Speaker 1>consideration like you've done or </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like with Randall Crawson's </v>

3593
02:55:20.111 --> 02:55:22.520
<v Speaker 1>done with asteroidal impacts is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely stunning and fascinating.</v>

3594
02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what he's done is done with very </v>

3595
02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:27.850
<v Speaker 1>careful consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely rattles real.</v>

3596
02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:31.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a real scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real thorough researcher and </v>

3597
02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:33.641
<v Speaker 1>investigator and he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the podcasts wasn't one of my all </v>

3598
02:55:33.641 --> 02:55:33.641
<v Speaker 1>time favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3599
02:55:33.641 --> 02:55:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yet these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas are fascinating,</v>

3600
02:55:33.771 --> 02:55:37.820
<v Speaker 1>but what I was gonna say was that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like the number is so large,</v>

3601
02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.440
<v Speaker 1>like 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>

3602
02:55:39.441 --> 02:55:41.900
<v Speaker 1>stones in the Great Pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so bizarre.</v>

3603
02:55:41.901 --> 02:55:43.610
<v Speaker 1>The numbers in tons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:55:43.611 --> 02:55:48.611
<v Speaker 1>The number of 50 to 70 tons roofing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king's chamber elevated to heights </v>

3605
02:55:49.071 --> 02:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>of 300 feet above the ground.</v>

3606
02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's almost perfectly aligned to true </v>
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>

3607
02:55:53.661 --> 02:55:58.661
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east and West within a fraction of a </v>

3608
02:55:58.661 --> 02:55:58.661
<v Speaker 1>single degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3609
02:55:58.661 --> 02:56:01.460
<v Speaker 1>so crazy that the like if they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back from,</v>

3610
02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:04.640
<v Speaker 1>from the past and if they come to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time today and go,</v>

3611
02:56:04.641 --> 02:56:06.250
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you guys think we did that?</v>

3612
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You think we use slaves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3613
02:56:09.771 --> 02:56:10.750
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3614

3645
02:57:31.271 --> 02:57:33.641
<v Speaker 1>unseen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can have a look beautiful and your </v>

3646
02:57:33.641 --> 02:57:33.641
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints of the Gods.</v>

3647
02:57:33.641 --> 02:57:36.611
<v Speaker 1>I've said it before when you've been on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast for changed my single </v>

3648
02:57:36.611 --> 02:57:37.940
<v Speaker 1>handedly changed my ideas about history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed my ideas,</v>

3649
02:57:37.941 --> 02:57:42.941
<v Speaker 1>not just not in any way discounting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing work that traditional </v>

3650
02:57:42.941 --> 02:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>traditional historians have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just that these things exist that </v>

3651
02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:52.151
<v Speaker 1>defy explanation and that I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that there is a guy from </v>

3652
02:57:52.151 --> 02:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Boston University named Robert Shaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a prominent geologists who said </v>

3653
02:57:56.860 --> 02:57:58.760
<v Speaker 1>this is clear erosion and there was last</v>
<v Speaker 1>time there was rosie was 9,000</v>

3654
02:57:58.761 --> 02:58:00.380
<v Speaker 1>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking about.</v>

3655
02:58:00.381 --> 02:58:05.381
<v Speaker 1>An insane amount of time has passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>since there was thousands of years of </v>

3656
02:58:05.381 --> 02:58:06.030
<v Speaker 1>that rain fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3657
02:58:06.031 --> 02:58:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you needed thousands of years to do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see on this.</v>

3658
02:58:08.850 --> 02:58:12.440
<v Speaker 1>This isn't wind like this is some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and that's what I try to do.</v>

3659
02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Fingerprints was to bring together </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like John Anthony West who </v>

3660
02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:17.780
<v Speaker 3>brought Robert show up to this fixate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Duvall,</v>

3661
02:58:17.790 --> 02:58:18.780
<v Speaker 3>like random rose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phlegm,</v>

3662
02:58:18.781 --> 02:58:20.490
<v Speaker 3>math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of researchers who were working in</v>

3663
02:58:20.491 --> 02:58:25.491
<v Speaker 3>the field and coming out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary information and part of </v>

3664
02:58:25.491 --> 02:58:27.561
<v Speaker 3>what I did in that book was was to bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that information together into a </v>

3665
02:58:27.561 --> 02:58:27.561
<v Speaker 3>kind of synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose</v>

3666
02:58:27.561 --> 02:58:31.680
<v Speaker 1>it's such an interesting theory and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an interesting subject and now that</v>

3667
02:58:31.681 --> 02:58:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it seeps getting substantiated by places</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go Beckley,</v>

3668
02:58:34.651 --> 02:58:38.160
<v Speaker 1>tappy or these micro meteors that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of piece the puzzle together.</v>

3669
02:58:38.161 --> 02:58:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as time goes on,</v>

3670
02:58:40.561 --> 02:58:43.410
<v Speaker 1>we're going to find there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of civilizations that we uncover</v>

3671
02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:48.590
<v Speaker 1>those ones that are finding in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there's ones that </v>

3672
02:58:48.590 --> 02:58:51.831
<v Speaker 1>they're finding in the Amazon with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing just like we were talking about </v>

3673
02:58:51.831 --> 02:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find a hill and they think it's a </v>

3674
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then someone realized.</v>

3675
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

3676
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a building guys.</v>

3677
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Huge earthworks in the Amazon stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>

3678
02:58:58.410 --> 02:59:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another place to look for a lost </v>

3679
02:59:03.410 --> 02:59:03.410
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

3680
