00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So how long have you been raising bees?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably only,</v>

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get started in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you start raising beings?</v>

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Start with one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll actually start with to really</v>

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>they're not like rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do produce quite quickly,</v>

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>my dad raised bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always saw boxes out in the corner of</v>

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We grew up in la here and you know,</v>

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the weather's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of activity that's the</v>

13
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>bummer about being unveiled now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of,</v>

14
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of b action going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too high.</v>

15
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>It's too cold and certain vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow there,</v>

16
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ranch love,</v>

18
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

19
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who in his backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

20
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>he probably had six hives and he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one really intense kind of rogue</v>

21
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>hive where maybe the queen had some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of strain of it,</v>

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>a africanized or something.</v>

23
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And her wife could not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife could not go out in the</v>

24
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>backyard without being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

26
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>can I go put my bees on your property so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can cycle this queen out,</v>

27
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got some breeding in.</v>

28
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It was just off Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

29
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he brought it out to the ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pinched the B and then a pinch.</v>

30
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>The queen pinched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean killed it?</v>

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And then she's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice euphemism.</v>

32
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have to shoot it or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold still.</v>

33
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>So he just grabbed the queen and killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

34
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Well has pinched it could because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was reproducing.</v>

35
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean they lay a million eggs in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

36
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's insane that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically,</v>

38
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I could sit here and talk a whole hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bees because they're so</v>

39
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

40
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the listener,</v>

41
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scaring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>they'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll listen.</v>

43
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting stuff.</v>

44
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it,</v>

45
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>put a new queen in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

46
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>they cycled through all of the other BS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they only live a month.</v>

47
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>So what is a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so informal reaction when people go in</v>

48
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the yard would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just disinterest.</v>

49
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't care about you as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not interrupting the hive.</v>

50
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your wife would go out there and</v>

51
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>they would just get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

53
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was my friends while.</v>

54
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.013
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.063
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of used to it and she was not.</v>

58
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>She was out to go swimming or go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they would,</v>

59
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>they would get crazy with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

60
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't bother me.</v>

61
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>But she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this queen.</v>

62
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this hive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

64
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain things if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in black,</v>

65
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>they all attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think you're a bear.</v>

66
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

67
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've just eaten banana's,</v>

68
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

69
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smell or something in it that is</v>

70
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>similar to their attack pheromone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set off.</v>

71
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's a few things I've learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years.</v>

72
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Tony Bananas and don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wear black.</v>

73
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you gotta do.</v>

74
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>But I learned this stuff being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bee club.</v>

75
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>You're in a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the bee club.</v>

76
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

77
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:12.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

78
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bay area.</v>

79
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd meet down at the,</v>

80
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Legion's Paul and have a</v>

81
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>monthly meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>one of those dorks like me and my buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

83
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.290
<v Speaker 1>we would just sit there and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh about them.</v>

84
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>But we're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here to learn some stuff.</v>

85
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>But there were people up there that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

86
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>we inseminated the queen with this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>there were counting bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>we put little numbers on every B and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've caught their flight pattern and</v>

89
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>how many were reproducing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it,</v>

90
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>it's all a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

92
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing research on how to make</v>

93
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>the stronger because the bees are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

94
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.483
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

96
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>this might this little Varroa mite</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's killing a lot of them too,</v>

97
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>along with the pesticides and</v>
<v Speaker 1>herbicides.</v>

98
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.554
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are so into it and we're</v>

100
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>just gonna sit in there going home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

101
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>what have we gotten ourselves into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's Kinda,</v>

102
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny in a certain way,</v>

103
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad that it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

104
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it at the end of the season,</v>

105
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you get like 500 pounds of honey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're handing them out to your friends</v>

106
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's loving it.</v>

107
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred pounds of honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

108
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And we're bottling it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids are filtering it,</v>

109
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>we're bottling it up and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

110
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just straight from the hive into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle.</v>

111
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you filtered it and it really</v>

112
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>helps with allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps with,</v>

113
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>the whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the pollens and then nectars</v>

115
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>from the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you take that in and it helps</v>

116
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>build your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

117
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've experienced that personally?</v>

118
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think being stung by bees helps</v>

119
00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:59.720
<v Speaker 1>you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps with,</v>

120
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.660
<v Speaker 1>with something getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your immune system built up.</v>

121
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be really good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis.</v>

122
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take people like literally take</v>

123
00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 2>bees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>

124
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 2>that have serious arthritis in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and they sting their hands.</v>

125
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

126
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>That on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some people that do it</v>

127
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>for their lips here in la.</v>

128
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need people that are so</v>

129
00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:20.511
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

130
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 2>deep into the pe world because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to do it.</v>

131
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone's just so far gone,</v>

132
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 2>they're measuring all their bs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring their flight patterns and</v>

133
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 2>checking their DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fascinated that there was a</v>

134
00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:37.781
<v Speaker 2>clear differentiation between a normal b</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way these bees were behaving</v>

135
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that you could tell that the queen was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a free.</v>

136
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those freak beast,</v>

137
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 1>the Africanized or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's a Zombie bee and we can,</v>

138
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:49.100
<v Speaker 1>we can get into that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

139
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are aggressive and an aggressive,</v>

140
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like any society,</v>

141
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.790
<v Speaker 1>they do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

142
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>they get most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produce a lot of honey and they,</v>

143
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

144
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>very prolific in what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

145
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had killer bee honey.</v>

146
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>They make killer be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

147
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>what sounded good on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he knows any better.</v>

148
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>If it's a killer bee honey is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than regular honey,</v>

149
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>but just pretty dope to have killer bee</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey around your house,</v>

150
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

151
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>And the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh.</v>

153

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this stuff called?</v>

154
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of really cool healing</v>

155
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>properties in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like even the,</v>

156
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of glue that they use to plug</v>

157
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 1>up holes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the Royal Jelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

159
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from there,</v>

160
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>like the brain and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they produce a queen.</v>

161
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Royal Jelly is.</v>

162
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>It's from their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain juice,</v>

164
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

165
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>How does it come out as it come out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole somewhere?</v>

166
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they have to scoop it out of</v>

167
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>their fucking heads?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it that close,</v>

168
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they injected into the,</v>

169
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>injected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the queen cell or there's a cell</v>

170
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>that they make when a new queen is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

171
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>So all the bees that are flying around</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see out here,</v>

172
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all females.</v>

173
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all female society,</v>

174
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>so the drones that are in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the males,</v>

175
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>they're there just to reproduce and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get kicked out in the wintertime</v>

176
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>and they all die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

178
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard outside.</v>

179
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal for us men in the B world.</v>

180
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So if they all die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they continue to reproduce?</v>

181
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

182
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess the couple stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

183
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.663
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

184
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the queen makes more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>So those guys are just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Queen makes more on the new ones.</v>

186
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Takeover the new boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're just doing work.</v>

188
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just fertilizing.</v>

189
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just there to fuck.</v>

190
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody else is doing all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real word fuck and go die.</v>

191
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get to do this brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

192
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what a fucking crazy world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the queen goes around the hive</v>

193
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>and finds the females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

194
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>other potential queens and stabs them</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're in the hive.</v>

195
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Well they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all females or all female except</v>

197
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>for those drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if there's,</v>

198
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.840
<v Speaker 1>if they're making a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>she knows she's going to die or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of pissed off with her.</v>

200
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>She's not reproducing as much as she</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

201
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>She will take off with like half the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hive and that's why you see a swarm.</v>

202
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>So she'll go and form a new hive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then these ones have a little queen cell</v>

203
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>that they've laid eggs and start to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new queen.</v>

204
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's how they reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's three or four queen cells</v>

205
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first queen that's born,</v>

206
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>she comes out and she kills all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other Queens so she can rule game of</v>

207
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>thrones type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

208
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to get bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell him I'm right now looking at</v>

209
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at websites in my hand.</v>

210
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like trying to find out where to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bees.</v>

211
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like an amazing way to get</v>

212
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just sounds like a really cool</v>

213

<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful spot.</v>

225
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that a b is Africanized?</v>

226
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Because that was the big thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was worried about.</v>

227
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You remember it was like the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

228
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did we say,</v>

229
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>found an African killer bee and no next</v>
<v Speaker 1>echo or something.</v>

230
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming up,</v>

231
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to swarm.</v>

232
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>They going to take over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And inside of a few years there was a</v>

233
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>big hysteria about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

235
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are states where there are more</v>

236
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>prevalent than others and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive or more aggressive and</v>

237
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.553
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

238
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very protective.</v>

239
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So you'll get stung if you're messing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

240
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing so.</v>

241
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big concern that they were</v>

242
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>going to take over and that it was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be that these bees,</v>

243
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>we're just gonna come here and outbreed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regular bs.</v>

244
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.400
<v Speaker 1>And you're laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember possible?</v>

245
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

246
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>There's some great movies about that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the killer bees.</v>

247
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>But there's no way to tell by looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

248
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

249
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't investigated that part</v>

250
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these bees that came over from the,</v>

251
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>perhaps africanized bees that when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the queen and then introduce</v>

252
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>those bees to the rest of the bs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody chill out.</v>

253
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just that one crazy bitch.</v>

254
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

255
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>she's laying the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's passing on the whatever DNA.</v>

257
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>

258
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

259
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>the forager bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you see out and about,</v>

260
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>they only live a month so they will die</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

261
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And how long did she live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can live between one to five years.</v>

262
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a bizarre culture.</v>

263
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool.</v>

264
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And without them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

265
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>orange almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff,</v>

267
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>especially here in California and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a center of California,</v>

270
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>all that farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no bs,</v>

271
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fruit.</v>

272
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a bizarre sort of symbiotic</v>

273
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>relationship that we have with some one</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird insect pollination.</v>

274
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have thought that that would</v>

275
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>have been taken care of some other way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't be that a b has to do</v>

276
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:32.851
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>there are others that do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

278
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 1>doing butterflies and certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

279
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>not just honey bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

280
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 1>there's probably over 3000 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of bees there.</v>

281
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a hive society like the</v>

282
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:53.210
<v Speaker 1>honeybees do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all these other bees are like</v>

283
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>loners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in the ground or something and</v>

284
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get enough pollen for</v>

285
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're kind of lone lone wolves out</v>

286
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the honeybees are the ones that have</v>

287
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>more of a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I raise chickens and um,</v>

288
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>this chicken thing with us happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got a couple of chickens and</v>

289
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know we have this giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking chicken house at 23 chickens and</v>

290
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:19.370
<v Speaker 1>they're running around my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same way with the leg?</v>

291
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of like slowly step into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then get deeper and deeper?</v>

292
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just like getting your first</v>

293
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.030
<v Speaker 1>tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

294
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

295
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want more.</v>

296
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

297
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just start to appreciate it.</v>

298
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think when I come off tour it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head is like ricocheting around and</v>

299
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 1>there I go and I sit and watch the bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just watch them go in and out,</v>

300
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like this frigging landing strip</v>

301
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that he come in and they look so busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It relaxes me.</v>

302
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

303
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

304
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that busy.</v>

305
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just chill.</v>

306
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

307
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Whey do you like a glass wall in any way</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can see into the.</v>

308
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen those hives where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make them?</v>

309
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you have it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can look in there.</v>

310
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got one of the.</v>

311
00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

312
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.000
<v Speaker 1>oh that's like a display one we bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>into schools and stuff.</v>

313
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.670
<v Speaker 1>See I don't have one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got a couple different kinds of</v>

314
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>hives and it's fun to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:22.251
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have the frames that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>already kind of prebuilt and then they</v>

316
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.850
<v Speaker 1>deposit their stuff in it or you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch them grow their own comb from</v>

317
00:13:26.851 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>nothing and it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get them to stay there</v>

318
00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how does it work?</v>

319
00:13:31.951 --> 00:13:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I see those boxes and I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bees do have hives in those boxes,</v>

320
00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but how does it initially start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

321
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:40.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wherever the queen is,</v>

322
00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that's where they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she decides to be in that.</v>

323
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.250
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get her to stay in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>box?</v>

324
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>You have a place for her to lay eggs.</v>

325
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

326
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she will stay and if she's there,</v>

327
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.680
<v Speaker 1>you know when they go off to to swarm to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go find a new hive.</v>

328
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.680
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen a swarm up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

329
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.820
<v Speaker 1>just like a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like football size or even bigger,</v>

330
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.480
<v Speaker 1>a shape of just bs at Queen is right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle and they're all just around</v>

331
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:12.690
<v Speaker 1>her and then they send off the scouts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a new spot.</v>

332
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.011
<v Speaker 1>They come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

333
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over here to do their little wiggle</v>

334
00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:19.560
<v Speaker 1>dance and that shows them how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they all go there.</v>

335
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.730
<v Speaker 1>We had an incident one time</v>

336
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.010
<v Speaker 2>once on fear factor where we covered</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people with bs.</v>

337
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:27.690
<v Speaker 2>There was like a beekeeper there and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had his hive and a local hive came over</v>

338
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.560
<v Speaker 2>and a group of bees came over and met</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these bees and we had to clear the</v>

339
00:14:31.561 --> 00:14:33.720
<v Speaker 2>area out and they had to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

340
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Literally what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in the air just floating</v>

341
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:42.240
<v Speaker 2>around and then they worked it out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the Arby's came back and they went</v>

342
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 2>back to the hive and their bees went</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their business.</v>

343
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 2>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>

344
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:47.390
<v Speaker 2>You guys moving in here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

345
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.960
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Territorial?</v>

346
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another they worked it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

347
00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>There was no death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will</v>

348
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.870
<v Speaker 1>be fucking braveheart war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>

349
00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>They figured it out at a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiator.</v>

350
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what do they communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>any living they using pheromones.</v>

351
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Like how are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells.</v>

352
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Smells and dances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dances,</v>

353
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some B will find it.</v>

354
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

355
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I found like a garden somewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back and they'll see him do</v>

356
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>the little wiggle thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many wiggles his way and</v>

357
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>then they turned left and then turn that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

358
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that's like a half a mile this way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that,</v>

359
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they all learn it and then they</v>

360
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

361
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I found some water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a place to go.</v>

362
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 1>So they literally can tell them where</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is,</v>

363
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>but the movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

364
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a,</v>

365
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>like a body language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

366
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all know it somehow.</v>

367
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Instinctively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

368
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

369
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bizarre.</v>

370
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot to learn about those things.</v>

371
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.570
<v Speaker 1>That's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that they can tell each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other where something is just by</v>

373
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>wiggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have like this means a mile.</v>

374
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>That means go left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

375
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.091
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get.</v>

376
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get deep and bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

377
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.860
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

378
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

379
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's probably a feel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

380
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.753
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

381
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole society right here in my</v>

382
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>yard and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overseeing it,</v>

383
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a sense of importance.</v>

384
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

385
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lay off him.</v>

386
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking them all the time and this and</v>

387
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 1>that and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to put the,</v>

388
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 1>the like certain pads in there to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mites and you gotta do this and</v>

389
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

390
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like another natural man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been around longer than we have.</v>

391
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what they're doing.</v>

392
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's to say I know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing with them.</v>

393
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Do they need specific types of plants</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them in order to survive?</v>

394
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

395
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.470
<v Speaker 1>something that they can pollinate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it's from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to plant,</v>

397
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what I've planned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I planted stuff that,</v>

398
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

399
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it blooms in the spring and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that blooms in the summer</v>

400
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 1>and then there's other stuff that blooms</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late summer so they've always got</v>

401
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they hibernate.</v>

402
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Speaker 1>They hibernate in the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

403
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Was like bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

404
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>So when you are in Vail and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:17:12.171 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you have obviously a really cold weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the winter,</v>

406
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just shut down and stay in the hive</v>

407
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>and don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

408
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have bees unveil yet and I'm</v>

409
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 1>going to try and figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

410
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mean just like cattle,</v>

411
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your winter room down in the lowlands.</v>

412
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I haven't found a place to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have bees go where there,</v>

414
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less.</v>

415
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

416
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll figure something out because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I love doing.</v>
