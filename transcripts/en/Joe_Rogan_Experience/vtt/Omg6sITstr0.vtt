<v Speaker 1>fight is actually to put your arm</v>

129
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrap your clothes or on your arm and</v>

130
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:32.700
<v Speaker 1>put a knife in your back hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

131
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.960

<v Speaker 1>get in a knife fight like you and</v>

133
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>another guy on the beach like circling</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other with a knife and your jacket</v>

134
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>wrapped around your forearm and b,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were tied together.</v>

141
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>People just do knife fights in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

142
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Remember those.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

161
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 3>really nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a documentary style or.</v>

162
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.923
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

163
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 3>there's some real footage of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual med,</v>

164
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:46.720
<v Speaker 3>a in cartel and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some real footage of like the</v>

<v Speaker 3>different busts and some murder footage.</v>

166
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Some bodies that they really real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

167
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.350

169
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 3>they show you real footage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part it just is the</v>

170
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 3>story of Pablo Escobar and his rise to</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

171
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking bad ass dude.</v>

172
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 3>It's so dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just did such a good job.</v>

173
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Netflix just as Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

175
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.084
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>

176
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 3>they can put together these things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make them like,</v>

177
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 3>like 10 movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like ten one hour movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best.</v>

179
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have trouble watching regular tv now.</v>

180
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Like hbo kind of spoiled us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watch a show.</v>

181
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean even though the beauty of Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you get it all at once,</v>

182
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 3>so the whole season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even still like we're watching</v>

183
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 3>dexter back in the day or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was really only a few good</v>

184
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 3>seasons there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

185
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever show that's on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can watch straight through with</v>

186
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 3>no commercials and no fast forwarding.</v>

187
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Night and day better than having to use</v>

188
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 3>the dvr and sit through the commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This just,</v>

189
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 3>that's caveman shit's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

190
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 3>It's old days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

191
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Those are the old days were done with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the commercial.</v>

192
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 3>They need to come up with a new way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell you shit,</v>

193
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like interrupting TV shows.</v>

194
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 3>It just makes me not want to buy their</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

195
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 3>There was some new comedy on tbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why we were watching it,</v>

196
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>but they kept showing Ford ads during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show and they were trying.</v>

197
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 3>They would make like a little chime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pong and then they would have this</v>

198
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 3>giant Ford.com on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they were trying to do it so</v>

199
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 3>blatant that it was humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it was like fucking</v>

200
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 3>irking me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what was this ridiculous?</v>

201
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>It was some new comedy on tbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some cheese Dick,</v>

202
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 3>a cop show.</v>

203
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 3>So while the show is on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the commercials playing over the</v>

204
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 3>dialogue and all that stuff would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>go home and then you'd see this thing</v>

205
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.610
<v Speaker 3>like superimposed over the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>screen for Daca and was repeated though.</v>

206
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.473
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

207
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 3>after the commercials you see this just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop up and they're like,</v>

208
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 3>this is the future of TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we're like that.</v>

209
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're doing to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter dvrs.</v>

210
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Just stick it even more in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking gross,</v>

211
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just over the top with it.</v>

212
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 3>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a dumb way to advertise.</v>

213
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 3>They just have to figure out a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to let people know about their shit,</v>

214
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.021
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just some,</v>

215
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 3>some cool way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way to do it,</v>

216
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.350
<v Speaker 3>but that's neither here nor there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

217
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 3>I love saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never get to know their heritage.</v>

220
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 3>you talking about it with me sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspired me a little bit because one of</v>

221
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 3>the big things a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you can't be.</v>

222
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 3>You can't do explosive activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

226
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.530

<v Speaker 3>online or tell people you're gonna,</v>

227
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 3>try something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking experts come so many people.</v>

228
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Even when that's why I deleted my</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook account,</v>

229
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't stand over the years in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC.</v>

230
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I just would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh sure,</v>

233
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.570

<v Speaker 3>people that think through your pals,</v>

234
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.690

235
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not subscribed to any of their shit.</v>

236
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point 7 million people following you</v>

237
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 3>online on twitter alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do this and people come</v>

239
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 3>out the woodwork about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would write about like,</v>

240
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read this book.</v>

241
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 3>It's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check it out.</v>

242
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody's got to come up with</v>

243
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.330
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a article I found online.</v>

244
00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I will send you the link and this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a total wack job.</v>

245
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 3>He's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This like this.</v>

246
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Like this one paragraph somebody wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to totally dispel and throw</v>

247
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 3>out the window what this guy spent years</v>
<v Speaker 3>researching and putting together in his</v>

248
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:25.950
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

249
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 3>It's always like Vegan news.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

250
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus sits on a real source of dare you.</v>

251
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

252
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this diet,</v>

253
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've been on it now only for four</v>

254
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:36.410
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

255
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 3>This is today I think is the fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third or fourth day,</v>

256
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 3>let's call it the third day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third day,</v>

257
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.980
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

258
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 3>I had headaches unlike the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around the second day I</v>

259
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 3>started getting a little bit ahead of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that on your instagram,</v>

260
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's got a fix for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the fix?</v>

261
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they transition low carb,</v>

262
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a window before you start</v>

263
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 3>producing ketones on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

264
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 3>You can jumpstart that window with</v>
<v Speaker 3>fasting,</v>

265
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 3>which is a total pain in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're carbohydrate</v>

266
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 3>dependent or you can cheat it by using</v>
<v Speaker 3>mct oil.</v>

267
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 3>So if you up your MCTs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first three days kind of borderline</v>

268
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 3>where you might shoot yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have,</v>

269
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you totally negate any of that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling like groggy.</v>

270
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't have the energy or fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

271
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't move like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eliminate that completely with</v>

272
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:23.340
<v Speaker 3>MCTs.</v>

273
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Why does mct oil make you shit yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it does.</v>

274
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not going to lie.</v>

275
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shipped myself at least five times</v>

276
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:37.641
<v Speaker 3>in the past two years as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some drunk milk I don't drink anymore,</v>

277
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

278
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 3>The mcts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a little cocky,</v>

279
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know I measure everything out</v>

280
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 3>religiously now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

281
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 3>but in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's fine tuning.</v>

282
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 3>It's all personal process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to start with a teaspoon.</v>

283
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm up to four tablespoons per pot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of coffee.</v>

284
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:01.201
<v Speaker 3>I make a whole pot blended up with a two</v>
<v Speaker 3>to one ratio of kerrygold butter to the</v>

285
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 3>MCT oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I have my little Stevia drops,</v>

286
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm on the road,</v>

287
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I got other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

288
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was on the road and I'm having</v>

289
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.080
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just take a gulp of mct Nixon.</v>

290
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 3>You bring your own whipping cream here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that heavy cream?</v>

291
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get on it bro.</v>

292
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Unless you don't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have a lot of heavy cream.</v>

293
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Got to get on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

294
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 3>You got to Stevia drops here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like Jim Carrey does.</v>

295
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Jim Carrey,</v>

296
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Jim Carrey has stevia drops a everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>go check out the.</v>

297
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 3>The coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the coffee in cars with</v>

298
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

299
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 3>he brings Stevia drops or the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it when he's out with Seinfeld.</v>

300
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

301
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 3>So tell me why do you have heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>whipping cream?</v>

302
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

303
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all is mark sisson detail</v>

304
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is grass fed free range.</v>

305
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 3>All good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a lactose intolerant or a</v>

306
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 3>dairy intolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

307
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 3>let's iron that out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't recommend this to anybody who</v>

308
00:12:58.571 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

309
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a way to get more fat.</v>

310
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

311
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.050
<v Speaker 3>We'd as natural people from a primal</v>
<v Speaker 3>standpoint when in periods of Ketosis,</v>

312
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 3>no matter where we were on planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know you were talking about the</v>

313
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is this ancestral diet stuff,</v>

314
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:19.310
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff that's based on where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live.</v>

315
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.360
<v Speaker 3>So if you had ancestors from the Poles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you likely had big game and fruits</v>

316
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 3>and vegetables and things that grew in</v>
<v Speaker 3>colder climates,</v>

317
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Kale and shit like that.</v>

318
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 3>If you were by the equator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller stuff,</v>

319
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 3>smaller live animals like chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

320
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things and then much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>

321
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 3>but both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter where you were from,</v>

322
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.010
<v Speaker 3>you had periods where you didn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's someone you'd produce your own</v>

323
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 3>ketones to remain in a ketogenic state.</v>

324
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 3>He really do have to have a much higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of fat and people think like way</v>

325
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 3>more to where you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's counterintuitive,</v>

326
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 3>especially with cholesterol and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

327
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 3>But the research is out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys are putting together</v>

328
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

329
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Dr David Perlmutter wrote Grain Brain in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2013.</v>

330
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 3>He had researched from 2013 and 2012 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>2011 all in the book in Twenty 15.</v>

331
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:08.140
<v Speaker 3>He followed up with brain maker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brand new studies are being put in that</v>

332
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like the very latest and what</v>

333
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 3>they're showing across the board is for</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the mental disorders like</v>

334
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dementia,</v>

335
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have to do with a really high</v>

336
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 3>blood sugar levels over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one person might manifest as type two</v>

337
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 3>diabetes and other person might get</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's.</v>

338
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just your genetic coding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the genetic difference.</v>

339
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Eating like Shit's going to get you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that disease,</v>

340
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself.</v>

341
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 3>It's just sugar itself seems to be just</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

342
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad deal.</v>

343
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

344
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 3>But as you'll find it's really easy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat too much protein on the Diet and</v>

345
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 3>that can knock you out of ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really getting too much protein</v>

346
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 3>knocks you out of Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

347
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a process the body does called</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluconeogenesis and this is kind of</v>

348
00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:56.650
<v Speaker 3>where Atkins failed a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even my dad was,</v>

349
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.493
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dot koons.</v>

350
00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I lost weight and what I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

351
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this pain across my chest and</v>

352
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 3>they call it like Atkins fever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel like flu symptoms,</v>

353
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:05.624
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

354
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 3>That comes from what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your energy source?</v>

355
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 3>So if people do a low carb diet and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

356
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have too much fat</v>

357
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>because that's not healthy and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand good fats and bad fats.</v>

358
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.521
<v Speaker 3>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

359
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 3>well I'll just stop my protein to fill</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and I'll have a little bit of fat and</v>

360
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now your body has to take protein</v>

361
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 3>and turn it back into glucose and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what gluconeogenesis does and it's a</v>

362
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 3>very you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body will do it,</v>

363
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's not an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fat and carbohydrates are much,</v>

364
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 3>much easier as energy sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can keep protein moderate,</v>

365
00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 3>that's why now modified Atkins or</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diets,</v>

366
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you it's high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate protein,</v>

367
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 3>low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say like moderate,</v>

368
00:15:46.141 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 3>like how many grams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grams of protein do you get in a day?</v>

369
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.050
<v Speaker 3>That's all individual for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

370
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 3>if you're working out how you work out</v>
<v Speaker 3>you about to 20,</v>

371
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.640
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to 25 right now.</v>

372
00:15:56.641 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

373
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 3>definitely under 140 grams of protein.</v>

374
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because I'm.</v>

375
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:10.180
<v Speaker 3>The bodybuilder method was one gram per</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound at least,</v>

376
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 3>and they were doing six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven meals a day.</v>

377
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Look the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're were putting on size,</v>

378
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to tilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dorian Yates how to put on size.</v>

379
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

380
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 3>they eat that way specifically for gains</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is scientifically proven to</v>

381
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 3>help with gains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're eating like a child basically.</v>

382
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 3>You have a newborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat every two hours.</v>

383
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're eating everything.</v>

384
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein and fat.</v>

385
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you want to gain size,</v>

386
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for this you don't necessarily need</v>

387
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can employ different methods</v>

388
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 3>like intermittent fasting where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about skip breakfast and just eat</v>

389
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 3>between 12 and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not that protein window of Oh my,</v>

390
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 3>my nitrogen balance is lowering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to lose muscle mass.</v>

391
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.163
<v Speaker 3>It's total crap.</v>

392
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.201
<v Speaker 3>They will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

393
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:52.170
<v Speaker 3>you skip a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna,</v>

394
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get weak,</v>

395
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total crap.</v>

396
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.220
<v Speaker 3>All the hormones that give us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

397
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 3>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that,</v>

398
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 3>igf one and growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all go through the roof when we</v>

399
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Speaker 3>donate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the longer we fast the hierarchy,</v>

400
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 3>ketone production is the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anti catabolic hormones are so their</v>

401
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 3>muscle preserving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you could do a fast incorrectly and</v>

402
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go run a wrong long race or,</v>

403
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.200
<v Speaker 3>or if you did high intensity stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>fasted then yeah,</v>

404
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you'd be running into problems there</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that because that's autolysis</v>

405
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body starts to break down muscle</v>

406
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.130
<v Speaker 3>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's called?</v>

407
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Autolysis because you're working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glycolytic.</v>

408
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 3>This is all right in there in the primal</v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance book.</v>

409
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 3>But Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the pick that up right after it</v>

410
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 3>was on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

411
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

412
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Neil Kendall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed talking to that guy.</v>

413
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

414
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 3>that was a really cool conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very eyeopening.</v>

415
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

416
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 3>one thing that really opened my eyes are</v>
<v Speaker 3>really had me thinking was they've shown</v>

417
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 3>on studies recently on children that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have epilepsy,</v>

418
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 3>that putting them in a ketogenic state</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to stop epileptic seizures or</v>

419
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 3>significantly reduce them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the Diet was developed in the</v>

420
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 3>19 twenties that I think it was John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopkins University or hospital,</v>

421
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 3>not university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johns Hopkins,</v>

422
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.740
<v Speaker 3>whatever put together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a team of guys there that</v>

423
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 3>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

424
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 3>there's actually a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was on the Tim Ferriss podcast.</v>

425
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Dr Dominic D'agostino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is awesome.</v>

426
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check him out.</v>

427
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 3>He's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that one.</v>

428
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.400
<v Speaker 3>South Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fasted for seven days and then left</v>

429
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 3>the house for 15 reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did five 85 or single,</v>

430
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 3>then gave a lecture to 300 plus people</v>
<v Speaker 3>on fasting and ketogenic diets.</v>

431
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

432
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 3>he's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super fucking intelligent now,</v>

433
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 3>like you're listening to them talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and how he travels with his own</v>

434
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 3>exogenous ketones that he throws into</v>
<v Speaker 3>his food.</v>

435
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:48.861
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried those yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know how nasty the rocket fuel stuff</v>

436
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 3>that when they first came out with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>liquid.</v>

437
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.920
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is jet fuel.</v>

438
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

439
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you a quiver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

440
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I think that stuff tastes worse than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than Iowasca.</v>

441
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the now the new stuff,</v>

442
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 3>they make it with Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all natural flavors like orange,</v>

443
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates.</v>

444
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

445
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the thought process between</v>

446
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.800
<v Speaker 3>behind eating exoticness ketones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

447
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I've noticed.</v>

448
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in a ketogenic state and Keto</v>

449
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 3>adapted and I'm producing my own</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones,</v>

450
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I feel a huge bump from a product like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that sergeant in addition,</v>

451
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.573
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

452
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in a carbohydrate necessary,</v>

453
00:19:27.071 --> 00:19:28.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy system and I haven't been in</v>

454
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Ketosis for awhile and then I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

455
00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to get low sleep tonight,</v>

456
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 3>so I want ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might feel like a slight difference,</v>

457
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to be nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatic as if I'm already in Ketosis.</v>

458
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

459
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Which is odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the mechanism of how it</v>

460
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 3>works or if my body just more in tuned</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use them when there's no</v>

461
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's night and day.</v>

462
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 3>I think the product is expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 75,</v>

463
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:58.191
<v Speaker 3>85 bucks for 15 servings probably we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going so I wouldn't use it every day,</v>

464
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.580
<v Speaker 3>but I'd use it for like a big race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Tasha and I are doing a 50 K in Zion</v>

465
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Speaker 3>coming up in April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be using them for that for sure.</v>

466
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 3>You would do it the morning of the race</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the race,</v>

467
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 3>during the race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 15 minutes beforehand and then</v>

468
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 3>every couple hours in for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now.</v>

469
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 3>How long have you been doing a Ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diet?</v>

470
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 3>A man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least a year and a half.</v>

471
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I've been in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm not going to.</v>

472
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 3>There is no point where I'll never eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbs again.</v>

473
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're phenomenal.</v>

474
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 3>There's periods of times where I'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 12 week block,</v>

475
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.700
<v Speaker 3>strict Kurtosis or 16 weeks in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straight district toast.</v>

476
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 3>What do you find when you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the difference?</v>

477
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>The biggest thing that I feel is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive boost,</v>

478
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>it's night and day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sharpness I have mentally is a.</v>

479
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

480
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what keeps me coming back</v>

481
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:53.180
<v Speaker 3>to it is the mental clarity and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

482
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 3>and then that's really interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose a little bit of water weight</v>

483
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 3>because glycogen holds water in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles so you don't lose any strength,</v>

484
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 3>but you'll lose some of that water</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

485
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel more flexible.</v>

486
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So when I do yoga and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can get into postures I could</v>

487
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 3>never get into when a carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't get into Lotus when I'm,</v>

488
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 3>when I'm eating carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's only five pounds difference</v>

489
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.100
<v Speaker 3>in my overall body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get into ketosis.</v>

490
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck.</v>

491
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is it binding in your knees and</v>

492
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 3>your hips?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's,</v>

493
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 3>what's holding you back while you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding water in for every gram of</v>

494
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 3>glycogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold four grams of water in the</v>

495
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 3>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

496
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense if you are loading on</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and things,</v>

497
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not carb loading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if your carb dependent,</v>

498
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 3>your muscles are going to hold more</v>
<v Speaker 3>water than if they weren't.</v>

499
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Is there any benefit to that as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>utilization of energy or ketones?</v>

500
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is all coming out of Steve</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finney and Jeff Volek,</v>

501
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.690
<v Speaker 3>they wrote the art and science of low</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate living in the art and</v>

502
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 3>science of low carbohydrate performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mark sisson of references them.</v>

503
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 3>They really broke down studies on</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes in a ketogenic diet and things</v>

504
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 3>like that and saw exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of enhancements that are being</v>

505
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:05.350
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

506
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.310
<v Speaker 3>And they kind of broke the mold of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>was done before when they ran tests,</v>

507
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gatorade was running tests and it was</v>

508
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:12.820
<v Speaker 3>coming up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

509
00:22:12.821 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 3>if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you simply aren't going to be able to</v>

510
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.470
<v Speaker 3>outperform somebody who has</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>

511
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 3>They weren't looking at somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was keto adapted.</v>

512
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 3>So it does take six to eight weeks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make your body prefer fat.</v>

513
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they were doing was just trying</v>

514
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:29.310
<v Speaker 3>it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put them in a state of Ketosis for</v>

515
00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of weeks and then two</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks exactly two weeks or six to eight</v>

516
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six to eight weeks.</v>

517
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:36.610
<v Speaker 3>And other people will tell you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer the better.</v>

518
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 3>So if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys that are winning the western</v>

519
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 is 100 mile race,</v>

520
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

521
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 3>they're in it for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

522
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:48.180
<v Speaker 3>you do pretty strict for a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half and then you see some,</v>

523
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 3>some significant jumps in fat oxidation</v>
<v Speaker 3>rates.</v>

524
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 3>So how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much can I break down in an hour</v>

525
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 3>while I'm under stress?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That changes dramatically.</v>

526
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 3>The longer you stay in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you do that,</v>

527
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 3>is it beneficial to put on some body fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long race like that?</v>

528
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're in a ketogenic state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body can burn off that fat.</v>

529
00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.900
<v Speaker 3>You would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They they've cry can't,</v>

530
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I can't read off numbers off the top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my head,</v>

531
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 3>but I mean when they talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

532
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 3>how much calories you can hold from</v>
<v Speaker 3>glycogen stored in the liver and all the</v>

533
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 3>carb loading you can do versus how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat you have on your body.</v>

534
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 3>You could run for days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we confessed.</v>

535
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 3>It's literally why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing like to dispel a</v>

536
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder myth on muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we lost muscle dramatically from</v>

537
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:34.240
<v Speaker 3>fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how do we chase down the heard</v>

538
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.410
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five days into not having food</v>

539
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

540
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:44.130
<v Speaker 3>We for sure evolve to be able to do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we could go long periods of time and</v>

541
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 3>have our explosiveness when we needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

542
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they weren't jumping on treadmills</v>

543
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 3>and doing stupid shit like we have to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

544
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.630
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was important for human beings</v>

545
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 3>to be able to have energy still in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fasted state for that long.</v>

546
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 3>And what you're talking about for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are unaware,</v>

547
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's called persistence hunting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first methods of hunting that</v>

548
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:08.711
<v Speaker 3>ancient people used to do and still do</v>
<v Speaker 3>in parts of Africa where they'll run and</v>

549
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 3>chase down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if an animal like an antelope,</v>

550
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 3>they run very fast for short periods of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

551
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 3>but they overheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get,</v>

552
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 3>they get hot and they get tired and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't run like we can.</v>

553
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 3>We can run at a slower pace for way</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

554
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 3>We could run all day because we sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't sweat.</v>

555
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.070
<v Speaker 3>So they overheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what ancient hunters would do is</v>

556
00:24:27.071 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 3>just chase them literally until they</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped and they would stab them.</v>

557
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 3>There's some pretty fucking trippy</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos of guys doing that today in</v>

558
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds bad ass.</v>

559
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just chase these animals down until</v>

560
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 3>eventually they just give up and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stab them.</v>

561
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine the runner's high have</v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing prey that long.</v>

562
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like your,</v>

563
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 3>that's your food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

564
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's spend five grand and go into</v>

565
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 3>safari.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's your food.</v>

566
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that must give you the thrill</v>

567
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.143
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

568
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna bring us back for my family.</v>

569
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 3>This is not something you did while you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were fighting?</v>

570
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

571
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fighting at the way I like to word</v>

572
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to play video games and love to</v>

573
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:07.700
<v Speaker 3>do shit and I'm not knocking video</v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

574
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a video game coming up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be awesome.</v>

575
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.010
<v Speaker 3>What does the Mafia three by two k</v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

576
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who played like a hitman or some</v>

591
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.710

<v Speaker 3>I had to do all that shit at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

601
00:27:17.931 --> 00:27:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I kicked this guy into the creek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

602
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.630
<v Speaker 3>the face is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an actor named Alex from New York.</v>

603
00:27:23.631 --> 00:27:26.780
<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the facial scan and the voice</v>

604
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.570
<v Speaker 3>just fucking video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The video is incredible.</v>

605
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.523
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

606
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel bizarre having some dude's</v>
<v Speaker 3>face on your body now?</v>

607
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Because I've met him and he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he was a Douche then I would look at</v>

608
00:27:59.591 --> 00:28:01.630
<v Speaker 3>it totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I love the guy.</v>

609
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.550
<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would suck.</v>

610
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.960
<v Speaker 3>The fucking video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graphics are insane.</v>

611
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.140
<v Speaker 3>This is really downplayed too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because it's the youtube,</v>

612
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.120
<v Speaker 3>like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go in the studio and see what</v>

613
00:28:13.121 --> 00:28:15.640
<v Speaker 3>they've done with it and you get to play</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game,</v>

614
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.560
<v Speaker 3>the end game is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

615
00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have whole teams that do the</v>

616
00:28:19.061 --> 00:28:20.890
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole teams that do buildings,</v>

617
00:28:20.891 --> 00:28:23.410
<v Speaker 3>everything you can go into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a door in the game that you</v>

618
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:27.100
<v Speaker 3>can't walk into and have some type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment to play with.</v>

619
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Just like the hair and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grass when they were in nom,</v>

620
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.580
<v Speaker 3>they're flying with the helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they look at the fucking grass,</v>

621
00:28:34.581 --> 00:28:36.550
<v Speaker 3>the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is incredible.</v>

622
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.420
<v Speaker 3>The facial recognition is the same stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Robert Zemeckis was using in his</v>

623
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:44.110
<v Speaker 3>movies when they walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We flew to La to do it.</v>

624
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.423
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty.</v>

<v Speaker 3>early seventies officers.</v>

628
00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Some good music to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is awesome,</v>

629
00:28:57.411 --> 00:29:00.080
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

630
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Well we get fucking some nights gory</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills for people that are into that sort</v>

631
00:29:05.591 --> 00:29:06.424
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

632
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.003
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

633
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how like if you want to</v>

634
00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:16.790
<v Speaker 3>talk about people that work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody works like why don't say nobody,</v>

635
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:19.220
<v Speaker 3>but they work some insane fucking long</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

636
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:20.960
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Putting together a video game with some</v>

637
00:29:20.961 --> 00:29:23.000
<v Speaker 3>really time intensive stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

638
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's around the clock.</v>

639
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see these guys when I go,</v>

640
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.510
<v Speaker 3>when I go to the MOCAP studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real laid back the same place.</v>

641
00:29:29.511 --> 00:29:31.910
<v Speaker 3>They do like the web game and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball game,</v>

642
00:29:31.911 --> 00:29:34.700
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you go in and you see the guys</v>

643
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:38.000
<v Speaker 3>that write the code and actually make</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game,</v>

644
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

645
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.900
<v Speaker 3>you can tell like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're on a deadline,</v>

646
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 3>get you're having to fix bugs and do all</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things and there's just a</v>

647
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 3>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're definitely putting in</v>

648
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 3>extreme hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

649
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.530
<v Speaker 3>it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was getting to before I</v>

650
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.690
<v Speaker 3>jumped off on the side there was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fighting,</v>

651
00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 3>I always had.</v>

652
00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.613
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

653
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 3>an idea of what I could do with my time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I had a fight coming up and I'm</v>

654
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing like a deadline of this</v>

655
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 3>guy's gonna try to knock me out in six</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

656
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.940
<v Speaker 3>five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks,</v>

657
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 3>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day you start to look at that day,</v>

658
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.610
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do today to make myself</v>

659
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 3>better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did I spend my time?</v>

660
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 3>And if my pie chart had three hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining myself,</v>

661
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 3>when it could have been learning about</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else to help me,</v>

662
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 3>like nutrition or different training</v>
<v Speaker 3>modalities,</v>

663
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:31.720
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

664
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 3>the choice was made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just overnight it was like,</v>

665
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done playing video games.</v>

666
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I have a playstation three just</v>
<v Speaker 3>collecting dust.</v>

667
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a new jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next generation I'll probably get one</v>

668
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 3>just to play this game.</v>

669
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

670
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 3>that really instilled in me a love and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thirst for knowledge.</v>

671
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I started reading about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read more books in my fight career</v>

672
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:54.420
<v Speaker 3>than I ever did in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting ever.</v>

673
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these camps where that's really</v>

674
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 3>how I'd spend my time is just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to better myself for the</v>

675
00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 3>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were in a strange position too,</v>

676
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 3>because you were a guy who came to</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts sort of late in life,</v>

677
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Speaker 3>so you came into it late in life as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great athlete who's learning all the</v>

678
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 3>different aspects of mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different martial arts</v>

679
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:20.260
<v Speaker 3>techniques and then competing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest level of the sport,</v>

680
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 3>like pretty much right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

681
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:22.654
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty dumb.</v>

682
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 3>It could have gotten a lot smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

683
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 3>it could have gotten a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot more intelligently planning a career</v>

684
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 3>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really it just all happened by</v>

685
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 3>storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

686
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.680
<v Speaker 3>I agree that that's not the way to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

687
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.340
<v Speaker 3>but some people can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Jones,</v>

688
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few guys that.</v>

689
00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:43.534
<v Speaker 3>Can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at,</v>

690
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.560
<v Speaker 3>talk about Jon Jones or a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel cormier.</v>

691
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>You look at the wrestling background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they were doing something</v>

692
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 3>totally different in martial arts the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole time,</v>

693
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 3>whether you want to call it that or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in martial arts their whole</v>

694
00:31:55.001 --> 00:32:00.001
<v Speaker 3>lives and then now they can focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at corn maze has striking</v>

695
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 3>because he didn't have to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have to spend time dividing up</v>

696
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 3>that pie chart into wrestling practice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other things.</v>

697
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

698
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit.</v>

699
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>We'll keep them sharp there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can really learn these other</v>

700
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 3>things and dive into them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's also,</v>

701
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 3>when you are a master at one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like sort of how Damien Maia is,</v>

702
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:22.870
<v Speaker 3>would you Jitsu such a master at it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those other things,</v>

703
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

704
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 3>he just has to be proficient enough so</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can get you in a position where he</v>

705
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 3>could use his mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even look at Verdugo is striking is</v>

706
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 3>really improved over the years because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he always had jujitsu moves back.</v>

707
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

708
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>And had it on such a high level than</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody he gets to the ground with is</v>

709
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a real bad spot,</v>

710
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your path was the path of the ultimate</v>

711
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

712
00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that TV show and like in not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

713
00:32:48.431 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 1>not just people that are on the TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people that do well in the smaller</v>

714
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 1>circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 1>smaller shows and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>they get a couple of fights under their</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt and they start looking good and</v>

717
00:32:58.011 --> 00:32:59.470
<v Speaker 1>then they get the call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a fight.</v>

719
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Someone needs to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight this guy on,</v>

720
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks notice you willing to do</v>

721
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:07.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of guys getting into</v>

722
00:33:07.561 --> 00:33:09.900
<v Speaker 1>the UFC fall outs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

723
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>someone from another organization looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

724
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 1>They've got something going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

725
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to,</v>

726
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 1>to engineer a career correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would do it the swim,</v>

727
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the same way they did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather in boxing or someone</v>

728
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:24.800
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

729
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 1>You would take them slowly through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amateur ranks,</v>

730
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 1>develop their skills and then test them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more,</v>

731
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 1>every fight a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them some fights where they can</v>

732
00:33:34.821 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>work on some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give him a guy who was a brawler.</v>

733
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Give them a guy who's a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's feather fisted.</v>

734
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Give them a guy who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's he hits really hard,</v>

735
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>but he fades after two or three rounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all these different sorts of</v>

736
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.340
<v Speaker 1>tests that you can give a boxer and know</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're ready for those tests were</v>

737
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the whole time they're getting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>cages to or reading time in,</v>

738
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 1>getting all that butterflies out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're spending more time in the pocket</v>

739
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:02.741
<v Speaker 1>and inside the old telephone poll booth</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with you.</v>

740
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.150
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking put your ass in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>catapult.</v>

741
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Launched you into the deepest part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>

742
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 3>It was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

743
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Was doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was never a plan though,</v>

744
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:15.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like something that's Sorta came</v>

745
00:34:15.601 --> 00:34:16.770
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

746
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.440
<v Speaker 3>football ended at Asu and I was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>

747
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I didn't want to have it fucking</v>

748
00:34:21.871 --> 00:34:23.670
<v Speaker 3>desk job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

749
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 3>athletics were really my outlet in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

750
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't discovered psychedelics or</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation or any of that stuff.</v>

751
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So inappropriate.</v>

752
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.000
<v Speaker 3>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had turned it up just so I could hear</v>

753
00:34:34.001 --> 00:34:36.090
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

754
00:34:36.091 --> 00:34:38.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what led you to,</v>

755
00:34:38.531 --> 00:34:40.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started training in mixed martial arts</v>

756
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.710
<v Speaker 3>just because I was tired of being a rat</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the wheel,</v>

757
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treadmills and lifting weights wasn't</v>

758
00:34:45.571 --> 00:34:50.250
<v Speaker 3>doing it for me and 26.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

759
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.100
<v Speaker 3>No martial arts at all before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

760
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wrestled in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so high school wrestling background ball</v>

761
00:34:57.211 --> 00:34:58.150
<v Speaker 3>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

762
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.700
<v Speaker 3>three years in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years in junior high.</v>

763
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I was decent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not great but um,</v>

764
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we got into it and then uh,</v>

765
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.560
<v Speaker 3>as I was learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a local guy down in Arizona</v>

766
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.220
<v Speaker 3>and he ran it like a little sleazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>organization down there and he was like,</v>

767
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:14.641
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:35:14.641 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you're big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he looked good and I know you played</v>

769
00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 3>football at Asu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you get in there and fight for</v>

770
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

771
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought a lot growing up.</v>

772
00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:25.830
<v Speaker 3>But it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different when you are in the</v>

773
00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:28.700
<v Speaker 3>moment and you want to destroy someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus some guy who was trained for you,</v>

774
00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:30.520
<v Speaker 3>you've never met before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

775
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.490
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your feet wet.</v>

776
00:35:32.491 --> 00:35:34.200
<v Speaker 3>If you like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it again.</v>

777
00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:35.520
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never do it again,</v>

778
00:35:35.521 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 3>but at least try one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

779
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

780
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 3>So my first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a 29 second victory.</v>

781
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Second fight was the 19 second victory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both knees to the stomach off of like</v>

782
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.430
<v Speaker 3>three months in Muay Thai training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then from there I was,</v>

783
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.270
<v Speaker 3>looked like you knock a guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

784
00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 3>that is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no drug like that.</v>

785
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

786
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 3>just lit up on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I started training and really</v>

787
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 3>trying to get more serious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I fought a lot of fights quickly.</v>

788
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.740
<v Speaker 3>So there was no development in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to five.</v>

789
00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside five months.</v>

790
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm six zero a sign with the king of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cage after that.</v>

791
00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:13.893
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

792
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting $100 a fight.</v>

793
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 3>My first fight fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

794
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.361
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

795
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I got a thousand dollars a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>king of the cage.</v>

796
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:21.800
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

797
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 3>after I took my first loss I was still</v>
<v Speaker 3>training out,</v>

798
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 3>kind of doing my own thing in Arizona,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I didn't,</v>

<v Speaker 3>frank shamrock had already been there.</v>

810
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Bob Cook had an in with the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

811
00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 3>So it just made sense to move home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start training their full time.</v>

812
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And within I think six months they got</v>

813
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 3>me on the ultimate fighter season eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the rest is history.</v>

814
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever think of it like,</v>

815
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had to do it all again differently,</v>

816
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.190
<v Speaker 3>how I would do it slower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

817
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Speaker 3>would take my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a million changes I could have</v>

818
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 3>made to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the end</v>

819
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really happy with what fighting gave</v>

820
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:23.724
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

821
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Fighting brought me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

822
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

823
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I give this all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the credit here,</v>

824
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.830
<v Speaker 3>but that doorway opened up other</v>
<v Speaker 3>doorways and those doorways open up</v>

825
00:37:32.831 --> 00:37:37.831
<v Speaker 3>other doorways to me and that really was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a catalyst for me having just deep peace</v>

826
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.180
<v Speaker 3>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.180
<v Speaker 3>and all these things came from that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bead in fighting,</v>

828
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wanting to do better for myself</v>

829
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:50.400
<v Speaker 3>because the guy was going to punch me</v>
<v Speaker 3>meant learning about meditation,</v>

830
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 3>learning about breathwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning about just getting more to</v>

831
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

832
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.780
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh okay,</v>

833
00:37:55.781 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelics can be a teacher as</v>

834
00:37:58.291 --> 00:37:59.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

835
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things all kind of came</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me in,</v>

836
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 3>in that same timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was sort of like the,</v>

837
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.770
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the urgency of knowing that you had</v>

838
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 3>to prepare for combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're constantly trying to better</v>

839
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:18.150
<v Speaker 3>yourself because the consequences of not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that are so grave that it sort of</v>

840
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 3>like ignited this fuel for improvement</v>
<v Speaker 3>in you.</v>

841
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

842
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:23.280
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did I do today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

843
00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 3>like you look back at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

844
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:25.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do today?</v>

845
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Did I do anything to make me better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

846
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's one thing to be a lot of guys</v>

847
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:31.391
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

848
00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:33.210
<v Speaker 3>it only went to the gym twice a train</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

849
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I got a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my recovery.</v>

850
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good with watching TV and just</v>

851
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 3>vegging out and doing whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine if you're.</v>

852
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you're beat sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just need to entertain yourself and</v>

853
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 3>relax and that's fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know that that just fueled</v>

854
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really became like where I'm going</v>

855
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 3>to read and in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but meditation,</v>

856
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I was like a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get it for a very long time.</v>

857
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of forced myself to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over time we've got a little easier,</v>

858
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't until Iowaska that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>really understood meditation and now</v>

859
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 3>with Wim Hoff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just added a whole nother</v>

860
00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 3>layer to meditation for me that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have before.</v>

861
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Wim Hof breathing techniques</v>

862
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 3>are just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're phenomenal.</v>

863
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's incredible.</v>

864
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I can't say enough good stuff about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

865
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 3>He's a fascinating character to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

866
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 3>what he's been able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the swimming underwater on</v>

867
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 3>the blocks of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the in the frozen ocean.</v>

868
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 3>One hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to swim 50 and he missed</v>

869
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 3>the whole and he doubled his distance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then frozen retinas fucking g</v>

870
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.000
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see because eyeballs froze like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

871
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.940
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's incredible.</v>

872
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 3>He's a very unusual human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people use that method.</v>

873
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that method of breathing,</v>

874
00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I use it before go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take these big crazy wim hoff breaths</v>

875
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 3>before I go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something to in letting go.</v>

876
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way in let her go.</v>

879
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 3>inspirational guy too.</v>

880
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that have really</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitated towards him.</v>

881
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:06.850
<v Speaker 3>His story was amazing and I've heard him</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Ferris.</v>

882
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I heard them on up in greenfields</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast when you've had them on and you</v>

883
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 3>correct beers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>vice docket and I love vice,</v>

886
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 3>but I thought the vice documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was shit 40 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>field and fact there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's books and there's science that</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was a professor at Ucla and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have a place in Ucla where they</v>

918
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 1>can conduct studies on the human energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>field and they've mapped this out by</v>

919
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:48.560
<v Speaker 1>changing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The electromagnetism they can make</v>

920
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:53.561
<v Speaker 1>people have emotional breakdowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose complete loss of motor control like</v>

<v Speaker 1>themselves up,</v>

923
00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.650
<v Speaker 1>but how are they doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with like they're manipulating</v>

924
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 1>through ion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

925
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:02.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

926
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 1>That's like a metal to get a giant metal</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

927
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:09.110
<v Speaker 1>some type of special room that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them go in and uh,</v>

928
00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>they just change this thing on a dial</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the field influences your human</v>

929
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 1>energy field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

930
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's fucking verified that did this</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while ago too.</v>

931
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 1>That's as crazy as it's like they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>known about this seventies,</v>

932
00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 1>eighties for sure.</v>

933
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredible radiolab podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

934
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:27.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

935
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put electrodes on this woman,</v>

936
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 1>they center through this sniper training</v>
<v Speaker 1>video game thing that they do where you</v>

937
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:38.690
<v Speaker 1>have like a rifle and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video game in front of you and</v>

938
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:41.030
<v Speaker 1>presented with all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios,</v>

939
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>like a hostage takeover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This terrorist show up.</v>

940
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>They start shooting at you and you tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot the terrorist under duress,</v>

941
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stressed out.</v>

942
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And so they take her through this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does terrible.</v>

943
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Just her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's off,</v>

944
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.330
<v Speaker 1>just panicky everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do it when they attach</v>

945
00:42:57.331 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 1>these electrodes tour and stimulate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>

946
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Parts of her head just on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like transdermally.</v>

947
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's where they doing electrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>

948
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Certain frequencies when they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate frequency or it was just</v>

949
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:12.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to work like on frontal lobe or</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

950
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact science behind</v>

951
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she then did it and went like 10 for</v>

952
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like killed everybody.</v>

953
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like her accuracy went through the roof.</v>

954
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Now the kids doing this shit where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make their own at a battery</v>

955
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 1>packs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

956
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all new science and has been</v>

957
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>doing this for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the ramifications</v>

958
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the Radiolab podcast sort of</v>

959
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 1>focused on some of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

960
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 1>oh well I went deaf for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

961
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck you do in your head man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just taking like nine</v>

962
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:48.620
<v Speaker 1>volt batteries and like taping wires to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skull and juicing themselves.</v>

963
00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>No fucking clue what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's something going on and they,</v>

964
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>the researchers that are working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they can accentuate</v>

965
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

966
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They can accentuate flow states where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into some sort of a zen moment</v>

967
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed if you're familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>binaural beats,</v>

968
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:04.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

969
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So a binder that's something that for in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties,</v>

970
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to see what a sound sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave therapy could do and things like</v>

971
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:16.401
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically,</v>

972
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would wear headphones or earbuds</v>

973
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and the basic concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premise would be I can play</v>

974
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>something at eight Hertz through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and 12 hertz through your right.</v>

975
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And your brain will match them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle at 10 hertz.</v>

976
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>10 Hertz is the</v>

977
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 3>frequency of Alpha waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our brain produces a wide variety of</v>

978
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:41.190
<v Speaker 3>different waves from zero point five</v>
<v Speaker 3>delta when you're in deep sleep all the</v>

979
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 3>way up to Beta state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we're in right now,</v>

980
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 3>drinking coffee and thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In between that you have an Alpha state</v>

981
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 3>which is closer to the earth's</v>
<v Speaker 3>residents,</v>

982
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 3>the earth's magnetic field where that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a meditative state.</v>

983
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 3>So you could have a flow state there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Rob Marcus has spoken about this,</v>

984
00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the flow state range between</v>

985
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 3>like seven point eight to 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in there.</v>

986
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Then below that deep meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of state,</v>

987
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 3>pre sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then delta and,</v>

988
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:12.150
<v Speaker 3>and there's other other things in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically through a binaural beats</v>

989
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 3>you put on these headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can listen to whatever,</v>

990
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean or rain or any of these things</v>

991
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 3>and you would have these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequencies playing through your years</v>

992
00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that you basically trick your brain</v>

993
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 3>into producing these brainwaves.</v>

994
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 3>And within minutes you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

995
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I just took a really nice nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel good,</v>

996
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I feel refreshed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

997
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would probably be great if you were</v>

998
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.850
<v Speaker 3>in like a pool tournament or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

999
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Like something where you want us to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into zones and get in the zone.</v>

1000
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Like I would think like archery or darts</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something where you just like,</v>

1001
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or three pointers,</v>

1002
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting three pointers.</v>

1003
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 3>We just get into that field [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that is,</v>

1004
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever that flow state is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1005
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 3>you're thoughtless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>

1006
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the Beta state that's,</v>

1007
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.590
<v Speaker 3>you were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind is racing.</v>

1008
00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:59.290
<v Speaker 3>That I was in the Beta state two nights</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago when I,</v>

1009
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 3>when I had three hours of sleep thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all these possible possible rabbit</v>

1010
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:05.760
<v Speaker 3>holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go down to conversation wise.</v>

1011
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1012
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:07.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1013
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 3>that state of the lack of sleep state</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1014
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shittiest thinking state.</v>

1015
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I come up with my worst thoughts when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exhausted or can't turn the mind</v>

1016
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:19.140
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have that issue.</v>

1017
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>

1018
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also like some silly creative</v>

1019
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 3>ideas though that come up when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausted.</v>

1020
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes when I'm exhausted I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the most ridiculous shit and it'll</v>

1021
00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 3>turn out to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to write it down.</v>

1022
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Like where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1023
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 3>the writers on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sitcom I was back in the day,</v>

1024
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.590
<v Speaker 3>they used to stay up late on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't start writing until two or</v>

1025
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 3>three in the morning and they would get</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves into like an exhausted stupor</v>

1026
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 3>and then they would start writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because all the running would be like</v>

1027
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 3>really hilariously silly because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were just fucking falling asleep.</v>

1028
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 3>They were just there just out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a state that you get that a</v>

1029
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>lot of writers to try to trick</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves into just by like getting</v>

1030
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:00.400
<v Speaker 3>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you were,</v>

1032
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>when you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what was the first sort of</v>

1033
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 3>improvement path that you started upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet nutrition right off the bat.</v>

1034
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 3>That was the one where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1035
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 3>this is something I can control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll help me just recovery,</v>

1036
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I recover faster?</v>

1037
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.060
<v Speaker 3>How do I flush metabolic waste?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1038
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there really was it.</v>

1039
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been into supplements.</v>

1040
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.910
<v Speaker 3>I read the muscle mag since I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>

1041
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 3>That kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1042
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>certain</v>

1043
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.510
<v Speaker 1>stuff works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff doesn't.</v>

1044
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 1>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1045
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 1>what you put in your body has a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>

1046
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's ever cleaned up their diet</v>

1047
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 1>and felt differently from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're listening to red band</v>

1048
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.480
<v Speaker 1>talking about the wage loss and how he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the energy now,</v>

1049
00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.950
<v Speaker 1>it just feels happy at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1050
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's in rainmaker also.</v>

1051
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 1>He talks about 80 percent of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin is made in our guts bacteria.</v>

1052
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of our feel good hormone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is made in our guts by bacteria.</v>

1053
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

1054
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think food does it impact</v>

1055
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know every cell of our body is made</v>

1056
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 1>from what we put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people don't think,</v>

1057
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eat this doughnut and it'll just.</v>

1058
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 1>My body will change it into what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be changed into bullshit.</v>

1059
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>

1060
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you influence the microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you put in your body,</v>

1061
00:48:13.741 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 1>if you putting good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to see like,</v>

1062
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you feel better.</v>

1063
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to think of ourselves as</v>

1064
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 1>independent from our food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were actually made out of our food.</v>

1065
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.210
<v Speaker 1>That's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

1066
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I had salmon the other night at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and um,</v>

1067
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I said to my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to Tony,</v>

1068
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hinchcliffe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1069
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is wild salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1070
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:32.951
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1071
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:34.990
<v Speaker 1>because it's too light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too light colored.</v>

1072
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1073
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it's a wild line caught</v>

1074
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 1>salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like not really buying it.</v>

1075
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1076
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see wild salmon,</v>

1077
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a dark orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1078
00:48:45.581 --> 00:48:46.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1079
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:46.721
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1080
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:47.920
<v Speaker 1>it's actually because of what they eat.</v>

1081
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It's come on bugs like certain bugs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat or shrimp.</v>

1082
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.730
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is it shrimper bugs find</v>
<v Speaker 1>on West Santa Ana.</v>

1083
00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

1084
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

1085
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

1086
00:48:58.331 --> 00:49:02.380
<v Speaker 1>US has sustained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know I'm butchering this asks us</v>

1087
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:07.381
<v Speaker 1>strengthen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a and t h I n s sold in</v>

1088
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sockeye Salmon,</v>

1089
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.860
<v Speaker 1>a salmon flush due to their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

1090
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 percent or more of their body mass</v>

1091
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foods they eat,</v>

1092
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1093
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the food they eat in the ocean is</v>

1094
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:23.650
<v Speaker 1>high and carotenoids the same pigment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives carrots color.</v>

1095
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 1>These pigments are stored in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh.</v>

1096
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 1>A salmon approaches their spawning</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds begin to absorb the scales.</v>

1097
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.853
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1098
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They begin to absorb their scales.</v>

1099
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 1>A weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1100
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get mushy.</v>

1101
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever caught a caught a salmon</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's dying?</v>

1102
00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Banners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went into,</v>

1103
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I had a bachelor party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy goes up every year to Alaska,</v>

1104
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 1>so we went fishing off the Kenai river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were,</v>

1105
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 1>we just fit it in before his wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were about a month or two late to</v>

1106
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a feast for Seagulls,</v>

1107
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 1>like all these old timers that spawned</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like swimming along,</v>

1108
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 1>like just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just full layers of skin and scale is</v>

1109
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:08.860
<v Speaker 1>just floating off of them ready to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:50:08.861 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>They become mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their flesh is like difficult to eat</v>

1111
00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:12.640
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like disgusting.</v>

1112
00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nasty.</v>

1113
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you could eat it if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stay alive,</v>

1114
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but they're literally breaking down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a little sashimi and that was a.</v>

1115
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That was a mistake for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should never eat salmon Sashimi.</v>

1116
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a smart move because they have</v>

1118
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 1>parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean fish or much better in regards to</v>

1119
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1120
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you caught the salmon in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

1121
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you're cool to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he even then,</v>

1122
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 1>because they go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go back and forth.</v>

1123
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I think is something about fresh water</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish are much more susceptible to,</v>

1124
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern nasty shit we put in there</v>

1125
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.710
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1126
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's nasty shit we</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in there.</v>

1127
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:53.051
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fish in the ocean naturally are</v>

1128
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.640
<v Speaker 1>of a higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less likely hood of a contracting.</v>

1129
00:50:58.641 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Any sort of parasites or you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher likelihood of getting it from.</v>

1130
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a freshwater fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you should never eat like large</v>

1131
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.630
<v Speaker 1>mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Sashimi.</v>

1132
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:09.543
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't eat that.</v>

1133
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think I'm talking out of</v>

1134
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:14.040
<v Speaker 1>my ass here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure of.</v>

1135
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I've read that you're not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat salmon Sushi,</v>

1136
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 1>People do and it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1138
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 1>point being this fish was really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pale and then we were talking about like</v>

1139
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>how weird it is that your food actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes the color of your skin.</v>

1140
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about black bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eat blackberries and blueberries,</v>

1141
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 1>like if you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1142
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:39.933
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1143
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>like certain hunters will go after bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in the fall because the fall</v>

1144
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 1>bears the gorge on blueberries and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh is just supposed to be</v>

1145
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the best tasting meat you</v>

1146
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:57.731
<v Speaker 1>can get because they're their flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then their fat itself is like a</v>

1147
00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:03.671
<v Speaker 1>purple color from all the blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it changes their actual physical</v>

1148
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:07.350
<v Speaker 1>flesh and it makes it absorb.</v>

1149
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you think about all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are eating McDonald's</v>

1150
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.100
<v Speaker 1>twinkies and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is their flesh?</v>

1151
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just high fructose corn Syrup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans Fats.</v>

1152
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Just dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pumping through your testimony in</v>

1153
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just any calories that can get ahold of</v>

1154
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 1>just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1155
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately that stuff breaks down the</v>

1156
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 1>protein and water and all the various</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of it.</v>

1157
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 1>But if that's all you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder why so many people are</v>

1158
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the modern American Diet,</v>

1159
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you look at the modern American diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sedentary lifestyle,</v>

1160
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel like shit.</v>

1161
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And what is depression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1162
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

1163
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>There's some depression that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely caused by a chemical</v>

1164
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 1>imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain's sick.</v>

1165
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:52.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like your liver can get sick and</v>

1166
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 1>your lungs can get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain can get sick,</v>

1167
00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole lot of depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I guarantee has to do with people</v>

1168
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>with sedentary lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty Diet,</v>

1169
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 1>and just no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real pushing of the body where your</v>

1170
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:09.170
<v Speaker 1>body never gets to flush it out.</v>

1171
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Never gets to blow those hormones up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never gets to get that blood pumping</v>

1172
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.211
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argue.</v>

1173
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:17.060
<v Speaker 1>The brain gets sick because you let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1174
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:19.910
<v Speaker 1>That way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stop moving and stop putting good</v>

1175
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>things in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have this downward spiral</v>

1176
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.890
<v Speaker 1>that just snowballs into deep depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>that know your buddy coming over and</v>

1177
00:53:26.891 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cheer you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

1178
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to snap yourself out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just overnight and you're</v>

1179
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>definitely not going to get it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>popping a pill.</v>

1180
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get off your ass and move and</v>

1181
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 1>start getting back out in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 1>To the pill thing is a weird one because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know for some people it's been very</v>

1183
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that were like severely</v>

1184
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got an antidepressants and they</v>

1185
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.180
<v Speaker 1>eventually wean themselves off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got happy first.</v>

1186
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1187
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Did they need the pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1188
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but the pills did help them and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder.</v>

1189
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to indicate that at all,</v>

1190
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder what lifestyle choices did</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make during that process as they</v>

1191
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:04.060
<v Speaker 1>started feeling better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1192
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little bit better.</v>

1193
00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go for a hike.</v>

1194
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did they do in addition to</v>

1195
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:10.980
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1196
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.590
<v Speaker 1>That helped them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't have the pills now,</v>

1197
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.860
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're off the pills now.</v>

1198
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.300
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get to that point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be like a,</v>

1199
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

1200
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 1>dudes that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

1201
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 1>he got married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell in love,</v>

1202
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 1>started his own business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his business became very successful,</v>

1203
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 1>started doing really well in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start feeling better about himself,</v>

1204
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 1>and then it all sort of fell together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said,</v>

1205
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get off these fucking</v>

1206
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:36.150
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he slowly weaned himself off and</v>

1207
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:41.151
<v Speaker 1>he's still happy and the other one got</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and got more confident and</v>

1208
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 1>then realize that the pills were</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like dulling his senses and</v>

1209
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 1>some sort of way and then slowly weaned</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself off,</v>

1210
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:51.450
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't really got into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

1211
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 1>The other thing he did was he got off</v>
<v Speaker 1>Propecia,</v>

1212
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that propecia shit that dudes do to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hair that took that and college</v>

1213
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff killed my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a CHT blocker.</v>

1214
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Dht makes you a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you bald,</v>

1216
00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 1>makes you have body hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to get rid of that</v>

1217
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 1>testosterone to get rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1218
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it can depress people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can cause severe depression.</v>

1219
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 1>it didn't in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely killed my deck,</v>

1221
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 1>like a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would make me depressed just right</v>

1222
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:21.400
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's depressing.</v>

1223
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't totally kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely.</v>

1224
00:55:23.651 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 1>What beats the fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1225
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing this to me?</v>

1226
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they say that you know,</v>

1227
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a balance that your hormones</v>

1228
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 1>achieve and anytime you fuck with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance with something like propecia</v>

1229
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that you know that blocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>dihydrotestosterone,</v>

1230
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1231
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:43.200

1232
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is this block like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1233
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Wha Wha wha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wha.</v>

1234
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 1>What is our issue here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can cause a cascade of issues</v>

1235
00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>like anytime you'd like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat the body as anything other than</v>

1236
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:56.970
<v Speaker 1>a holistic approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a holistic approach,</v>

1237
00:55:56.971 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you look at this guy's depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

00:55:58.861 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>well let's look at his diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1241
00:56:00.511 --> 00:56:02.730
<v Speaker 1>We need to get them on a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't make any sense.</v>

1242
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>You need to look at the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's his diet like?</v>

1243
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 1>How often does he sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he?</v>

1244
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Does he drink a lot of water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he have something to get over?</v>

1245
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's something that was fucking his wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sometimes you just have to</v>

1248
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to overcome a periods of</v>

1249
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:21.200
<v Speaker 1>life that just suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I,</v>

1251

<v Speaker 3>Only you're going to sleep through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's everything though with the,</v>

1255

<v Speaker 3>with the Western medicine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>knee.</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you break your arm,</v>

1259
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 3>they fixed my shoulder when I was a dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass and had a torn labrum.</v>

1260

<v Speaker 3>I love it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what would happen to your shoulder</v>

<v Speaker 3>snatch and missed it with it.</v>

1263
00:56:57.541 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Didn't feel anything there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I waited a minute and reattempted</v>

1264
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 3>the same weight and then I felt like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just felt like no strength at all.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we've just been talking to people that</v>

1267
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 3>have shoulder surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I thought I had this dumb ass</v>

1268
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 3>idea in my head like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1269
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:16.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be able to run still.</v>

1270
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:17.560
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1271
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>you can't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even walk.</v>

1272
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I had to be very careful with my arm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sling for at least the first six</v>

1273
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then at six months I could start rehab.</v>

1274
00:57:27.011 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 3>It took me a whole year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really did.</v>

1275
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.270
<v Speaker 3>And really I give a ton of credit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly,</v>

1276
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:34.660
<v Speaker 3>start a for getting full range of motion</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1277
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.060
<v Speaker 3>The becoming a supple leopard guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had for a long period of time</v>

1278
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 3>thought like this is as far as my arm's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go.</v>

1279
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Not quite that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Quite Hail Hitler,</v>

1280
00:57:43.451 --> 00:57:45.460
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had no full range of motion.</v>

1281
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I can get my bicep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't get my bicep to my ear and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew it was short in certain positions.</v>

1283
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Like if you get in grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

1284
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:55.360
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that guy sprawls while</v>

1285
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 3>you're holding a single leg that's nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that three inches makes all the</v>

1286
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:00.610
<v Speaker 3>difference in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like from feeling like,</v>

1287
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's putting pressure on me,</v>

1288
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I should change positions or my arm's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to snap.</v>

1289
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference.</v>

1290
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.080
<v Speaker 3>If you defending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked a head and arm choke on the right</v>

1291
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 3>side and someone tries to straighten</v>
<v Speaker 3>your arm out,</v>

1292
00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 3>what does that like when he presses up</v>
<v Speaker 3>against your head?</v>

1293
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Everything's fine now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But initially it was a nightmare.</v>

1294
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just,</v>

1295
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get biceps to ear while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to you.</v>

1296
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 3>So for sure if someone's trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me,</v>

1297
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to feel like something's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna tear</v>

1298
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 3>six months before you can start doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab.</v>

1299
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.070
<v Speaker 3>And that was a process that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1300
00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:30.990
<v Speaker 3>just nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1301
00:58:30.991 --> 00:58:33.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know now listen to my body,</v>

1302
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 3>don't push the envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1303
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we slap tear.</v>

1304
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an acronym.</v>

1305
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>It's the placement of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1306
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 3>The placement of will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The labor room is like the,</v>

1307
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 3>it holds this ball in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1308
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 3>So slap is the position of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on the front side.</v>

1309
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

1310
00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:56.350
<v Speaker 3>it was a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1311
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all placement.</v>

1312
00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:02.320
<v Speaker 3>All arthroscopic go in there and sew it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back up.</v>

1313
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I have very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very minimal scarring there.</v>

1315
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically what it is.</v>

1316
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:09.040
<v Speaker 3>They just go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do everything through the,</v>

1317
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.390
<v Speaker 3>through the vision of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little cameras and it's easy.</v>

1318
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:15.610
<v Speaker 3>It's easy fix for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it had a great guy.</v>

1319
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.910
<v Speaker 3>He's worked on tons of NFL guys I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm grateful that I have full</v>

1320
00:59:18.911 --> 00:59:20.990
<v Speaker 3>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really it's,</v>

1321
00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a nasty deal</v>

1322
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.920
<v Speaker 1>to have to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.480

<v Speaker 1>joint issues and somehow or another it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to mitigate the issues of</v>

1336
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>mobility in a joint problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I need to get my dad in that he</v>

<v Speaker 1>arms go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you could arm bar?</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1343

<v Speaker 1>but for years he ate whatever the hell</v>

1344
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>he wanted and he still did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got his black belt a year ago.</v>

1345
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on the mat all the time.</v>

1346
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm how old you done?</v>

1347
01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Sixty four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1348
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Gets his black belt at 63.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a stud.</v>

1349
01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:46.151
<v Speaker 1>He started at 56 dud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fat loser with a super,</v>

1350
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>super stressed job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started fighting,</v>

1352
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>he got into Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did full contact karate,</v>

1353
01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

1354
01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So he understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking,</v>

1355
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling,</v>

1356
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>but the second hit the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1357
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing,</v>

1358
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>like have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1359
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>once he started immediately became</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

1360
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody who does Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1361
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the feeling you get when you first start</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lost 50 pounds without even</v>

1362
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>changing his diet in the first six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1363
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a life changer for them for</v>

1364
01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking great.</v>

1365
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I love hearing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Anthony Bourdain keeps saying he'll</v>

1366
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>never get his black belt bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy will get his black belt.</v>

1367
01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>He started when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 57 and he's got his blue belt</v>

1368
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>now at 58.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll get it for sure.</v>

1369
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>He'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a maniac.</v>

1370
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>He takes one private and one full class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1371
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>one regular class a day everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>

1372
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>everyday cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not if you've got cheese?</v>

1373
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got the cheese and he's also got</v>

1374
01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1375
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Bj Penn about this.</v>

1376
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn was hilarious about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to this guy and the guy</v>

1377
01:01:53.721 --> 01:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1378
01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told you no,</v>

1379
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>because Bj famously got his black belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>in three years and one day,</v>

1380
01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all three years in,</v>

1381
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and this guy had gotten his black belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

1382
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I think around four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Bj was like,</v>

1383
01:02:06.111 --> 01:02:06.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1384
01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:07.491
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1385
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be really talented.</v>

1386
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1387
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:10.641
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1388
01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1389
01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1390
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And bj started laughing.</v>

1391
01:02:15.781 --> 01:02:16.491
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

1392
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted.</v>

1393
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get</v>

1394
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.540
<v Speaker 3>addicted to good things too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1395
01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 3>no question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1396
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:24.820
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1397
01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.240
<v Speaker 3>that is runners high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people would sign up for a</v>

1398
01:02:27.241 --> 01:02:28.710
<v Speaker 3>race that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1399
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not healthy for you to run that</v>
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>

1400
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>but it feels good training and preparing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting your body ready for that.</v>

1401
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And that keeps you coming back for more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Like 100 mile runs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are fucking terrible.</v>

1403
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Destroy you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got to be bad you.</v>

1404
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 3>They've done blood work on people even</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just after a marathon,</v>

1405
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 3>which is ridiculous in its own right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would see like borderline</v>

1406
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 3>kidney failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your kidneys can barely keep up</v>

1407
01:02:52.111 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 3>with removing metabolic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 3>You don't look after those things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your piss looks like Coca Cola.</v>

1409
01:02:58.830 --> 01:02:59.663
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>

1410
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1411
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never want to get to the point where I p</v>

1412
01:03:03.231 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>looks like coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking terrible man.</v>

1413
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>But people like they also get addicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pushing themselves.</v>

1414
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1415
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bow hunter,</v>

1416
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but he's also does ultra marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of merit.</v>

1417
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.150
<v Speaker 1>He started getting in shape just so he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get up the mountains easier.</v>

1418
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Like cars in bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two things that come into play.</v>

1419
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be fit in order to get up</v>

1420
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the mountains because all that hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exhausting,</v>

1421
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>especially at high altitude and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be strong to be able to pack</v>

1422
01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you carry an animal,</v>

1423
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you kill it and you have to get it down</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mountains.</v>

1424
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.200
<v Speaker 1>A lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those two things led him down this</v>

1425
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>road of starting to do marathons and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting a lot of weights and doing all</v>

1426
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:46.560
<v Speaker 1>these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now he's doing ultra marathons.</v>

1427
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 1>He's doing something called the big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

1428
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>It's 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go 100 miles a day and the next day</v>

1429
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:54.140
<v Speaker 1>another hundred miles like</v>

1430
01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.800
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what the cutoff is for that</v>

1431
01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:00.290
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes they're right around</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 22 hours.</v>

1432
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Just what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take an hour nap and then go right</v>

1433
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:05.150
<v Speaker 3>back to running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if you sleep.</v>

1434
01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:10.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean you probably in so much agony</v>
<v Speaker 3>after 24 hours of running 200 miles.</v>

1435
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.500
<v Speaker 3>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 wasn't enough guys.</v>

1436
01:04:14.501 --> 01:04:18.830
<v Speaker 3>It's weed out the policies here and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get 200 some lady in my neighborhood did</v>

1437
01:04:18.831 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1438
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did 200 fucking miles.</v>

1439
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 1>She did a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred miles one day.</v>

1440
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:24.840
<v Speaker 1>One hundred miles the next day.</v>

1441
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Bitch is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I say bitch with all due respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>and admiration.</v>

1443
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.731
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:35.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean leslie anything wrong with</v>

1445
01:04:35.141 --> 01:04:36.580
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just tough as shit.</v>

1446
01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 3>But they get addicted to like pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1447
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like there's a thing that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some people when they get involved in</v>

1448
01:04:43.031 --> 01:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>these heavy endurance races were part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1449
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The addiction is one more hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five more miles,</v>

1450
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>10 more miles.</v>

1451
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Just push your kid into a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do get into a flow state and it does</v>

1452
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.210
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The longer you go,</v>

1453
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.210
<v Speaker 3>the better it feels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously you can deal with</v>

1454
01:04:59.211 --> 01:05:02.090
<v Speaker 3>ticketek injuries and things like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever you got to deal with in the</v>

1455
01:05:02.091 --> 01:05:05.180
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at a certain point in time the</v>

1456
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:09.050
<v Speaker 3>mental chatter quiets down and you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>find your rhythm and you find your</v>

1457
01:05:09.051 --> 01:05:12.320
<v Speaker 3>breathing and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be meditative completely.</v>

1458
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>And the longer it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better for people like that.</v>

1459
01:05:15.531 --> 01:05:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Once you're in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1460
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1461
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:22.621
<v Speaker 3>I've felt that in half marathons on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last six miles and finish stronger in</v>

1462
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 3>the end than I did in the first half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1463
01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.980
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure runners be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1464
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 3>of course we ran more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd know that dummy for that,</v>

1465
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 3>that I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why we sign up for this 50 k</v>

1466
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>coming up just for the fact like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1467
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Kelly started a 50 k at 230 pounds.</v>

1468
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:39.320
<v Speaker 3>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1469
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying I'm going to make a</v>

1470
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:44.260
<v Speaker 3>regular habit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's healthy by any means,</v>

1471
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:46.770
<v Speaker 3>but I do want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A 50 is like a mile time,</v>

1472
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A marathon is what?</v>

1473
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:53.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit longer to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a marathon is 26 point two miles</v>

1474
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 3>and a 50 k's run around 33.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1475
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:58.350
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense to point.</v>

1476
01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Jamie would know the powers of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Google,</v>

1477
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 3>the powers of Google 31 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's a runner too.</v>

1478
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.273
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1479
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is that what fuels your competitive</v>

1480
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.460
<v Speaker 3>desires now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like doing different things,</v>

1481
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:18.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like working out with Jesse burdick.</v>

1482
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who does power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a beast.</v>

1483
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1484
01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:26.860
<v Speaker 3>so training once a week I'll go up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>train with him and Dublin at CSA and we</v>

1485
01:06:26.861 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 3>do some heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy lower body.</v>

1486
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 3>It could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll squat heavy.</v>

1487
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 3>One day we'll do a heavy sumo deadlift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy conventional to whatever,</v>

1488
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's just a,</v>

1489
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.400
<v Speaker 3>it's good to train with guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>way better than you at whatever their</v>

1490
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 3>respective thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1491
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can go in there and learn from him and</v>

1492
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the guys that got working out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean a lot of good and I</v>

1493
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:51.100
<v Speaker 3>love lifting who doesn't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger.</v>

1494
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get a taste for that,</v>

1495
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 3>that is an addictive thing and I love</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting heavy weight because I feel</v>

1496
01:06:56.531 --> 01:06:58.530
<v Speaker 3>better throughout the week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1497
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I just feel better as a person doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1498
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.120
<v Speaker 3>When I'm in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel better being in shape.</v>

1499
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>So going for longer distance runs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having something,</v>

1500
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's light at the end of the</v>

1501
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:09.400
<v Speaker 3>tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like April ninth,</v>

1502
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm running the 50 k.</v>

1503
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 3>That makes it easy for me to come home</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm tired and say I got to get at</v>

1504
01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:15.670
<v Speaker 3>least three miles in today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of thing.</v>

1505
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know this event's coming up so</v>

1506
01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put in some roadwork today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't fuck with your shoulder</v>

1507
01:07:20.711 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This heavy lifting the shoulders.</v>

1508
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 3>A hundred percent know why and I give</v>
<v Speaker 3>full.</v>

1509
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it sound like I'm blowing the</v>

1510
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:29.350
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Kelly start really.</v>

1511
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I have everything to thank from that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1512
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 3>What did you do that he will have his</v>
<v Speaker 3>banded mobility and you can look them on</v>

1513
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.260
<v Speaker 3>a mobilitywod.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He posted 500 videos on youtube.</v>

1514
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.340
<v Speaker 3>He's got a shoulder one that's I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes long and that long,</v>

1515
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 3>but he shows eight different stretches</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the shoulder using one of those</v>

1516
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:49.870
<v Speaker 3>rogue bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1517
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 3>And you spent two minutes in a stretch</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum.</v>

1518
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So there's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>32nd hold shit is out the window.</v>

1519
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.930
<v Speaker 3>He talks about Fascia in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>release it really has to be,</v>

1520
01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.160
<v Speaker 3>have some time under tension and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1521
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 3>you distract things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I couldn't.</v>

1522
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't get the same experience if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>put my hand on a wall and try to stretch</v>

1523
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:08.194
<v Speaker 3>my chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1524
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 3>But if I can pull in this band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it distracts the impingement in my</v>

1525
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and now the Fascia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the palm of my hand,</v>

1526
01:08:16.281 --> 01:08:20.640
<v Speaker 3>and my thumb will go all the way to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>ear lobe and open up a.</v>

1527
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 3>So I'll feel everything the same way a</v>
<v Speaker 3>foam roller can,</v>

1528
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>can relax my it band right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get that for my shoulder and all</v>

1529
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:30.650
<v Speaker 3>these different positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what gives me my mobility</v>

1530
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:32.960
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the basic idea is that hey,</v>

1531
01:08:32.961 --> 01:08:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I can be able to get in this position</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

1532
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:36.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1533
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He name is booked at supple Leopard</v>

1534
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Leopard's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see them getting up and having</v>

1535
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 3>to do a five minute warmup guys and</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch up with you in a second.</v>

1536
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

1537
01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do downward dog upward dog and then</v>

1538
01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:48.260
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going right.</v>

1539
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 3>So I have that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder now because of putting in</v>

1540
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 3>that work over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what a lot of fighters are</v>

1541
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:56.840
<v Speaker 3>realizing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The importance of softness and</v>

1542
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 3>flexibility and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just to be pliable and you have to</v>

1543
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:00.880
<v Speaker 3>be mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.770
<v Speaker 3>you have to be mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to be rigid and stiff,</v>

1545
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 3>it impedes movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I see it a lot from people when</v>

1546
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:10.490
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I see guys kicking and I see like</v>

1547
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 3>stiffness and like sort of a general</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of fluidity and the way they move,</v>

1548
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I can tell immediately I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's just not flexible enough to</v>

1549
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 3>throw on these kicks.</v>

1550
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 3>And there's all this resistance from</v>
<v Speaker 3>their supporting leg.</v>

1551
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 3>There's resistance from the kicking leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's resistance from their</v>

1552
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:28.280
<v Speaker 3>torso.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it all as they start</v>

1553
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.270
<v Speaker 3>throwing kicks and then the kick will</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up instead of go across the hip,</v>

1554
01:09:32.271 --> 01:09:35.510
<v Speaker 3>won't be high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That won't be as much a forward movement</v>

1555
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 3>with the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely could be mental too though.</v>

1556
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:39.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always looking back,</v>

1557
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 3>honestly on my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought stiff,</v>

1558
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.260
<v Speaker 3>stiff as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1559
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Like really stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never sparred.</v>

1560
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I never fought the way I sparred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather look at Luke rockhold and I'm</v>

1561
01:09:48.921 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy fights the way he spars.</v>

1562
01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't give a fuck what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming at him.</v>

1563
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 3>He kicks beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And with everything is thrown is with</v>

1564
01:09:56.271 --> 01:09:57.080
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1565
01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he mentally got to that point where</v>

1566
01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 3>he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm going to destroy you and I'm</v>

1567
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:03.020
<v Speaker 3>not worried about what you.</v>

1568
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:07.940
<v Speaker 3>How much difference was there with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>with how you performed in the gym versus</v>

1569
01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 3>how much you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you performed inside the octagon?</v>

1570
01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.910
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a fairly big difference.</v>

1571
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Like a 30 percent difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty percent difference.</v>

1572
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could put a number on it,</v>

1573
01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1574
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1575
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's hard to gauge with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cain.</v>

1576
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Cain destroyed everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1577
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.361
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1578
01:10:26.361 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this time I sparred Kane and I</v>

1579
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 3>got them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1580
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 3>you can't whoop my ass every time we</v>
<v Speaker 3>spark.</v>

1581
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 3>But there was a point in time where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did well with Daniel.</v>

1582
01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Cormier are times where I did well with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold times where I did well</v>

1583
01:10:37.491 --> 01:10:41.210
<v Speaker 3>with Mike Kyle and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pull them Otello and you know,</v>

1584
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.410
<v Speaker 3>even in my best fights in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with Ricardo Ramiro,</v>

1585
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>think those.</v>

1586
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.860
<v Speaker 3>The only time I got to get interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by you afterwards,</v>

1587
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it took me like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason the fight turned out</v>

1588
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 3>that way and I was able to get into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>zone was because I was so sick the night</v>

1589
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:59.410
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought like two.</v>

1590
01:10:59.411 --> 01:11:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had fucking sweat the bed.</v>

1591
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I was rolling around in my sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just soaked a bed.</v>

1592
01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:08.870
<v Speaker 3>This worst fever I've ever had and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight I'm walking out and I was</v>

1593
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After two minutes of warming up,</v>

1594
01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I stopped warming up in the in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>locker room completely gassed and I</v>

1595
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked if this thing goes longer</v>

1596
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 3>than men and I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized right then Brian,</v>

1597
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 3>when they shut the cage door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to fight.</v>

1598
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:26.930
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I can do here but fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>and right when I made that realization,</v>

1599
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 3>that put me in the zone because there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was no thought.</v>

1600
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:33.600
<v Speaker 3>That's why the fight is 23 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it was.</v>

1601
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>It felt like it was in slow motion and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could never get back to that point</v>

1602
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technical skills mentally to do it,</v>

1603
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 3>or there's the knowhow of how I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1604
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I knew I could look back in</v>

1605
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>hindsight and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1606
01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the catalyst.</v>

1607
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I had my back against the wall and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just completely let go.</v>

1608
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I know from Iowasca ceremonies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>

1609
01:11:56.011 --> 01:12:00.920
<v Speaker 3>like there's a big lesson in letting go</v>
<v Speaker 3>and surrendering to the process is like</v>

1610
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.500
<v Speaker 3>don't fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking go with uh,</v>

1611
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.000
<v Speaker 3>but those things didn't transfer the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had hoped.</v>

1612
01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about that before my last</v>

1613
01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hoped that the lessons I learned from</v>

1614
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca of surrender would transfer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have this like,</v>

1615
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck mentality.</v>

1616
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.770
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And looking back on that fire,</v>

1617
01:12:18.771 --> 01:12:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still nervous to show,</v>

1618
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.640
<v Speaker 3>even though looking at photos online and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1619
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 3>pat's going to punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't afraid of getting punched.</v>

1620
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 3>No offense to pet cummins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't afraid of getting punched by</v>

1621
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not after glover and in MANITOWOC and</v>

1622
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm squeezing the low fat,</v>

1623
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right as he's about to hit me.</v>

1624
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid tents.</v>

1625
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So there wasn't a transfer there of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of skills from the beauty of Iowasca</v>

1626
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 3>because it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know enough time to process</v>

1627
01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:54.951
<v Speaker 3>it or you needed more of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences or there was a really,</v>

1628
01:12:55.261 --> 01:12:56.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:12:56.191 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 3>there's a large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large,</v>

1630
01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything kind of goes together with</v>

1631
01:12:59.911 --> 01:13:00.721
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1632
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:01.554
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1633
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:04.463
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1634
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:08.320
<v Speaker 3>spending time developing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>

1635
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:09.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a,</v>

1636
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:13.270
<v Speaker 3>there's no eight week camp where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be as good a wrestler is that</v>

1637
01:13:13.271 --> 01:13:14.360
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

1638
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter who I'm working with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1639
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:19.990
<v Speaker 3>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously you can build a game plan and</v>

1640
01:13:19.991 --> 01:13:21.910
<v Speaker 3>work on take down a fence and look it</v>
<v Speaker 3>over in.</v>

1641
01:13:21.911 --> 01:13:24.640
<v Speaker 3>St Louis did great against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an excellent fight.</v>

1642
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:26.710
<v Speaker 3>So I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1643
01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:28.960
<v Speaker 3>like in hindsight maybe it could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>done it like that,</v>

1644
01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:30.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I could have had better footwork</v>

1645
01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and done these things and worked on</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1646
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really put too much thought into</v>

1647
01:13:35.171 --> 01:13:39.490
<v Speaker 3>how I could've done that better now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have really accepted the fact</v>

1648
01:13:39.491 --> 01:13:41.980
<v Speaker 3>that I'm done doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1649
01:13:41.981 --> 01:13:45.130
<v Speaker 3>like the more I would put thought into</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I could've done it better,</v>

1650
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:47.030
<v Speaker 3>the more it makes me want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1651
01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the big deciding factor to make</v>

1652
01:13:50.921 --> 01:13:53.410
<v Speaker 3>you want to retire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>

1653
01:13:53.411 --> 01:13:56.230
<v Speaker 3>really was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number of things.</v>

1654
01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.064
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1655
01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:00.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a second job the whole time I was</v>

1656
01:14:00.191 --> 01:14:01.600
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with the fight,</v>

1657
01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.930
<v Speaker 3>the fight of the nights at to fight of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nights.</v>

1658
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I got to train full time for maybe six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months and then the first loss I had to</v>

1659
01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 3>go right back to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bouncing at the titty bar,</v>

1660
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.760
<v Speaker 3>bartending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>managing that kind of stuff.</v>

1661
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:19.120
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need sleep for recovery.</v>

1662
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 3>And I had that just felt that window of</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can sleep and train full time and know</v>

1663
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:27.220
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to have full recovery now</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's yanked back away from me.</v>

1664
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Why was it yanked back away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you,</v>

1665
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.240
<v Speaker 3>when you lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who made less money?</v>

1666
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:32.170
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>

1668
01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:34.990
<v Speaker 3>with the fracture to like even take for</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1669
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>when I had a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those fights,</v>

1670
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:42.250
<v Speaker 3>I got fight of the night with Maldonado.</v>

1671
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 3>That was my only fight that year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got an extra 40 grand.</v>

1672
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.340
<v Speaker 3>That's when I was getting 10 and 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 60 grand,</v>

1673
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:51.760
<v Speaker 3>10 percent coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 percent of management pay the irs.</v>

1674
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.240
<v Speaker 3>That's not a lot spread over the year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's less than a teacher.</v>

1675
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.220
<v Speaker 3>So I needed to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1676
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.260
<v Speaker 3>and then that's Kinda how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have you,</v>

1677
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:03.830
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get hurt in a fight and you only</v>

1678
01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:06.210
<v Speaker 3>fight that once that year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be the,</v>

1679
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.180
<v Speaker 3>the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.940
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how much risk</v>

1681
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>versus reward there is in the sport of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

1682
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 3>like at the very high levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're conor mcgregor or Ronda</v>

1683
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.121
<v Speaker 3>Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1684
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

1685
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.830
<v Speaker 3>But on the way up to that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1686
01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.170
<v Speaker 3>can you break through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1687
01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:29.140
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time I was,</v>

1688
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming familiar with Iowasca was</v>

1689
01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:36.430
<v Speaker 3>having a ceremonies where a lot of shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>was getting uncovered.</v>

1690
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.670
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1691
01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I've worked through all this baggage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1692
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

1693
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 3>there was V,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had many,</v>

1694
01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:46.480
<v Speaker 3>many great visions and each ceremony has</v>
<v Speaker 3>its own.</v>

1695
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 3>It's its own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely unique from another same</v>

1696
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 3>thing with dmt that it's its own fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1697
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:58.500
<v Speaker 3>And it helped me grow as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say which ceremony made me not</v>

1698
01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 3>have that spark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But over time that spark went away.</v>

1699
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.840
<v Speaker 3>The spark to want to destroy another</v>
<v Speaker 3>person slowly left me.</v>

1700
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.450
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't matter what a fighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you on a flight because of this,</v>

1701
01:16:11.451 --> 01:16:12.190
<v Speaker 3>a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>

1702
01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:15.490
<v Speaker 3>they all inside them want to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 3>another person.</v>

1703
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Deep down inside they want to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1704
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what victory is.</v>

1705
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to want to.</v>

1706
01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.310
<v Speaker 3>That victory is you submit someone or UK</v>
<v Speaker 3>on them.</v>

1707
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the ultimate victory.</v>

1708
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 3>You stopped them and that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to do.</v>

1709
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the challenge is extremely high.</v>

1710
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.510
<v Speaker 3>And then the reward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the endorphins,</v>

1711
01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:36.580
<v Speaker 3>the rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feeling of accomplishment,</v>

1712
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day,</v>

1713
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I think probably what Iowasca and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt would show you is that,</v>

1714
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:46.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1715
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.480
<v Speaker 3>you're causing damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just this destructive thing,</v>

1716
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way around it even if you</v>

1717
01:16:55.121 --> 01:16:58.900
<v Speaker 3>both sign up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if the guy talks shit before</v>

1718
01:16:58.901 --> 01:17:00.030
<v Speaker 3>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:02.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1720
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 3>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1721
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it would be really hard to handle</v>

1722
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 3>if it was a mismatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if a,</v>

1723
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 3>if you took Iowasca and you had this</v>
<v Speaker 3>vision and then you were supposed to</v>

1724
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 3>fight somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1725
01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:17.270
<v Speaker 3>like in your heart was really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they had bad stand up or</v>

1726
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:17.930
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1727
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 3>And you knew they weren't gonna be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take you down.</v>

1728
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy is going to get lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1729
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.940
<v Speaker 3>sorry dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1730
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 3>you're under a false illusion of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities.</v>

1731
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that would make it very difficult.</v>

1732
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

1733
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1734
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still see guys know,</v>

1735
01:17:35.771 --> 01:17:39.200
<v Speaker 3>like they kind of snap out of it when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the opportunity to crush</v>

1736
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:42.470
<v Speaker 3>someone whose life lists and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>referees still hasn't stopped them and</v>

1737
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:45.140
<v Speaker 3>then they pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's moments there and there's</v>

1738
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:46.880
<v Speaker 3>also moments where you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1739
01:17:46.881 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you got the blinders on and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1740
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit when the rep comes</v>

1741
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:52.650
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was asking you think that started you</v>

<v Speaker 3>are you now?</v>

1745

<v Speaker 3>I feel better than I've ever felt in my</v>

1748
01:18:06.801 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physically,</v>

1749
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 3>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally.</v>

<v Speaker 3>come on guys.</v>

1753
01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 3>If I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I stopped striking.</v>

1754
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you sharpen the blade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to test it,</v>

1755
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still do.</v>

1756
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll do Jujitsu the rest of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't strike if I strike,</v>

1757
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I know I'll have that itch really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1758
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll have the itch to spar and from</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring I'll,</v>

1759
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a couple of good days and your</v>

1760
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who am I testing that against world</v>

1761
01:18:35.181 --> 01:18:38.700
<v Speaker 3>champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I fucking hang right next shortly,</v>

1762
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:42.290
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to apply this to guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't have a belt wrapped around</v>

1763
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:42.650
<v Speaker 3>their waists.</v>

1764
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1765
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I've learned on a living,</v>

1766
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.660
<v Speaker 3>listen to like Dr Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrick and people like that I've had my</v>

1767
01:18:50.661 --> 01:18:55.661
<v Speaker 3>face broken twice to act like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have permanent effects.</v>

1768
01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous to think like,</v>

1769
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:00.411
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1770
01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:01.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just an orbital fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1771
01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 3>the guy fucking smashed my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's for sure longterm damage</v>

1772
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 3>there that I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not feeling it right now,</v>

1773
01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 3>but that's an issue I have to address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guys only a couple of years</v>

1774
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.240
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 33,</v>

1775
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 3>35,</v>
<v Speaker 3>36 and they start to slow down a little</v>

1776
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 3>bit or a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry I was getting audio and just one</v>

1777
01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:24.050
<v Speaker 3>of your new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it pop off sometimes I think</v>

1778
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 3>disconnects a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See where the connection is.</v>

1779
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:28.390
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1780
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1781
01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:34.940
<v Speaker 3>you see if I can notice it in other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are just a couple of years</v>

1782
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 3>older than I know that's what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen because it's not.</v>

1783
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:40.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch a guy like randy couture fight</v>

1784
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:40.851
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1785
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:43.760
<v Speaker 3>that he's in everyone's face and suck</v>
<v Speaker 3>grinded on dudes.</v>

1786
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.450
<v Speaker 3>He even with always been knocked out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1787
01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.280
<v Speaker 3>He didn't stand in Bang with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1788
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Like there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of many fights.</v>

1789
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Even when when bonner crushed me for 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and laid on me and didn't</v>

1790
01:19:57.681 --> 01:20:00.950
<v Speaker 3>attempt much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took a beating in that fight.</v>

1791
01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1792
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 3>when I fought glover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no broken bones,</v>

1793
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 3>but that's the only fight where I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost leaving octagon.</v>

1794
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Bob Bob left and I didn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back to the locker room and I didn't</v>

1795
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:15.420
<v Speaker 3>want to ask anyone because I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>a longer suspension,</v>

1796
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:20.280
<v Speaker 3>a medical suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he fucking buried two hooks after</v>

1797
01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 3>slipping my left right Combo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one left hook.</v>

1798
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Then I throw it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He slips berries.</v>

1799
01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 3>That same exact spot in the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1800
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the only fight where I literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>did not know where the locker room was</v>

1801
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 3>and I was wandering around talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1802
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 3>making small talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1803
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.681
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1804
01:20:37.681 --> 01:20:38.281
<v Speaker 3>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1805
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that was a tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1806
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.720
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know where anything was.</v>

1807
01:20:42.721 --> 01:20:43.770
<v Speaker 3>And then I finally made have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1808
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad.</v>

1809
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.540
<v Speaker 3>That's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't want to ask anybody</v>

1810
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:51.300
<v Speaker 3>because you didn't want a longer medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspension.</v>

1811
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1812
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 3>So that I felt the effects there on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1813
01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel the effects from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>orbital fractures,</v>

1814
01:20:59.461 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 3>but I could see the effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1815
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1816
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you see a couple of guys just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years older,</v>

1817
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:10.220
<v Speaker 3>slowing down a little bit and you learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>about health and being holistic and</v>

1818
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

1819
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 3>And what am I doing for myself to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>better person?</v>

1820
01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 3>How can I live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more out of life?</v>

1821
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Where's my quality of life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1822
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm doing that and then that's where</v>

1823
01:21:19.871 --> 01:21:20.704
<v Speaker 3>I could drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1824
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.930
<v Speaker 3>if I want to alter my consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a better way to do it than with</v>

1825
01:21:24.931 --> 01:21:26.160
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1826
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.030
<v Speaker 3>And there shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be a double edged sword.</v>

1827
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.870
<v Speaker 3>When did you quit drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A January sixth.</v>

1828
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.750
<v Speaker 3>The last time I drank of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year in Peru.</v>

1829
01:21:36.751 --> 01:21:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Hold last year I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a ceremony in Columbia and uh,</v>

1830
01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 3>the guy was talking about addiction to</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and I never felt addicted at all</v>

1831
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.540
<v Speaker 3>to drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely drank like an asshole</v>

1832
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.550
<v Speaker 3>for sure many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

1833
01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1834
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had mentioned next time you drink,</v>

1835
01:21:56.581 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 3>ask what you were feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything we put in our body is feeding</v>

1836
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:00.630
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask what you're feeding.</v>

1837
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And it just didn't hit me then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but later on in the ceremony,</v>

1838
01:22:03.511 --> 01:22:05.370
<v Speaker 3>it really stuck in like I could see all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1839
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 3>the destructive behavior of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1840
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:09.660
<v Speaker 3>let's party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go balls to the wall.</v>

1841
01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1842
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slapping five and just,</v>

1843
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:12.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>

1844
01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Spring Breaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asu type Jock,</v>

1845
01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:16.141
<v Speaker 3>meathead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1846
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 3>more and more and more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1847
01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:19.740
<v Speaker 3>And then just the destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the toll it was taking on me,</v>

1848
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially as you get older,</v>

1849
01:22:21.451 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 3>like you can drink like that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

1850
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.640
<v Speaker 3>but you get to 30 something stops</v>
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>

1851
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>you're hangovers last a little longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:30.800
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harder to keep up with,</v>

1853
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're aware,</v>

1854
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember being hung over when I</v>

1855
01:22:35.881 --> 01:22:39.900
<v Speaker 3>was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was so unaware of how that,</v>

1856
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.220
<v Speaker 3>like what I put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it affected my body.</v>

1857
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought of myself as I was in</v>

1858
01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:50.250
<v Speaker 3>such a fog of confusion when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>

1859
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to get through life that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think I was aware of my body.</v>

1860
01:22:53.911 --> 01:22:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I am aware of now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now if I do things like just</v>

1861
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:00.780
<v Speaker 3>changing my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like really tuned into what kind of</v>

1862
01:23:00.781 --> 01:23:02.130
<v Speaker 3>effect it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any.</v>

1863
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm much more aware.</v>

1864
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 3>When I was in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I necessarily recovered</v>

1865
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>from hangovers better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't notice it as much because I</v>

1866
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 3>was just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1868
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get pizza,</v>

1869
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:19.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked another beer.</v>

1870
01:23:19.611 --> 01:23:20.330
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of that,</v>

1871
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:21.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1872
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do feel like there are,</v>

1873
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:26.890
<v Speaker 3>as you age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your organs just don't keep up the same,</v>

1874
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like that was a big can,</v>

1875
01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 3>but really just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reflection for me of seeing how I</v>

1876
01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:37.630
<v Speaker 3>behaved with that versus like if I wanna</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I want to feel different,</v>

1877
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:41.980
<v Speaker 3>thanks to the wonderful people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>California that allow medical cannabis,</v>

1878
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I can feel different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1879
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I could sleep like a baby and I can wake</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with zero hangover.</v>

1880
01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not going to get fat from it.</v>

1881
01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to underperform the next</v>

1882
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mentally or physically.</v>

1883
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.770
<v Speaker 3>You also get benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like many bins.</v>

1884
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 3>The antiinflammatory benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mental benefits of it,</v>

1885
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:03.640
<v Speaker 3>the sensitivity benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comradery that it sort of</v>

1886
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:07.060
<v Speaker 3>stimulates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of sense of community that</v>

1887
01:24:07.061 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 3>comes with smoking cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you like a more generous and</v>

1888
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 3>nice person and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But alcohol</v>

1889
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has its place.</v>

1890
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:20.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it's fun in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>

1891
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 3>but boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so abused,</v>

1892
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.750
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this culture and our culture,</v>

1893
01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:28.180
<v Speaker 3>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so commonly abused by so many</v>

1894
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:33.181
<v Speaker 3>people and they don't even consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just pound them just fucking abuse</v>

1895
01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 3>pot too.</v>

1896
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.050
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was in college,</v>

1897
01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I abused pot actually here in Graham</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hancock.</v>

1898
01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Talk about his relationship under</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast with cannabis and how Iowasca</v>

1899
01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:47.770
<v Speaker 3>showed him that and he quit for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 3>until coming back on the podcast and</v>

1900
01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.830
<v Speaker 3>spoken with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1901
01:24:48.831 --> 01:24:52.340
<v Speaker 3>that was great because evil kind kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the same thing for me.</v>

1902
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 3>It didn't show me my relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 3>weed that way.</v>

1903
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>It actually reversed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it showed me that my relationship</v>

1904
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:01.630
<v Speaker 3>with alcohol that way and I don't need</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1905
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 3>but it also showed me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1906
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 3>cannabis is a plant cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Dan Hardee said in one of his visions</v>

1907
01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 3>when he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have asked about cannabis.</v>

1908
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Cannabis is my sister was the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is another one of these is</v>

1909
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 3>another teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is another tool.</v>

1910
01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:17.380
<v Speaker 3>This is here for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it,</v>

1911
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.190
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that if you treat it with</v>

1912
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 3>respect and you have an intention and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why you're doing it and it's not,</v>

1913
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a time and a place for a man.</v>

1914
01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get bombed and feel out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this world or I'm going to push the</v>

1915
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.770
<v Speaker 3>envelope and maybe do a mega dose and</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump into a float tank,</v>

1916
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.140
<v Speaker 3>which I still need to try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1917
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:38.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part you can have</v>

1918
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.710
<v Speaker 3>relatively small amounts of things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and completely improve your quality</v>

1919
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:44.130
<v Speaker 3>of life with zero repercussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1920
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 3>because you put in the time and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right intention of this is what I</v>

1921
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:48.350
<v Speaker 3>want to use it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1922
01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repercussions that it is something you</v>

1923
01:25:51.191 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 3>have to weigh action versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussion.</v>

1924
01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 3>And with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the repercussions are just fucking</v>

1925
01:25:56.201 --> 01:26:00.760
<v Speaker 3>devastating over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a fucking unfortunate</v>

1926
01:26:00.761 --> 01:26:02.320
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they've figured out a way to</v>

1927
01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:04.060
<v Speaker 3>create alcohol without any</v>

1928
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.220
<v Speaker 1>hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been some new research on</v>

1929
01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:09.640
<v Speaker 1>something that gives you like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic effect,</v>

1930
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't give you a hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's not like synthetic weed or</v>

1931
01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>something isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That weirdo knockout shit.</v>

1932
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder what effects on internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>organs fighting has not just done the</v>

1933
01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:24.740
<v Speaker 1>kidneys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we know get really fucked up.</v>

1934
01:26:24.741 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>

1935
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kidney stones are one side effect that</v>

1936
01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 1>some people seem to suffer from</v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydration,</v>

1937
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 1>from weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know all those had some kidney stones.</v>

1938
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:37.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters have had kidney stones</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1939
01:26:37.351 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>They're really common for guys who cut a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of weight,</v>

1940
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but also I would just wonder just body</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks and knees the body and punches.</v>

1941
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many times he get kicked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liver before it does damage to your</v>

1942
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 1>liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if alcohol is bad for your liver,</v>

1943
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:53.360
<v Speaker 1>what does a Shin do to it?</v>

1944
01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is what is a fucking vicious left</v>

1945
01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 1>hook to the liver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting by lasted.</v>

1946
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's any mean.</v>

1948
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 1>We constantly consider the stress on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and the damage to the brain from</v>

1949
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 1>head impacts and brain trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about body trauma?</v>

1950
01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder about that because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen guys get fucking blast today.</v>

1951
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>

1952
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like you watch a guy eat a liver</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and the fights over from a body</v>

1953
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:23.530
<v Speaker 1>kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1954
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.373
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1955
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Rub some dirt on it and he's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1956
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 1>just ended the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1957
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:35.590
<v Speaker 1>So when you look back at your career and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look back at all these wars and all</v>

1958
01:27:35.691 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 1>these crazy fights that you got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1959
01:27:38.121 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think about the damage?</v>

1960
01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it something you just like put aside</v>

1961
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.420
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there probably was some done and</v>

1962
01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 1>just just move forward and stay positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be healthy from here on out and I</v>

1963
01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing that I disagree with</v>

1964
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>people when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1965
01:27:55.801 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we grew up they said,</v>

1966
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:01.550
<v Speaker 1>oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a set number of brain cells and</v>

1967
01:28:01.551 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 1>whatever you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get back.</v>

1968
01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.050
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we now know that's bullshit.</v>

1969
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Like our brain can create new cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neurogenesis happens and the more you</v>

1970
01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more new stuff you do,</v>

1971
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 1>whether it's learning an instrument or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new language or taking a different trail</v>

1972
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.760
<v Speaker 1>to hike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1973
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that helps strengthen these new</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways.</v>

1974
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make you smarter and just keep your</v>

1975
01:28:20.811 --> 01:28:22.060
<v Speaker 1>brain young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1976
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think for one second that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that I'd done in my career</v>

1977
01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:30.731
<v Speaker 1>can't be overcome or that I can't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like from diets like this and</v>

1978
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:32.720
<v Speaker 1>supplementing with mcts and different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1979
01:28:32.721 --> 01:28:37.721
<v Speaker 1>I feel quicker now in sharper now than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever have in my life mentally so that</v>

1980
01:28:38.031 --> 01:28:39.290
<v Speaker 1>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>

1981
01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look back and say,</v>

1982
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:41.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this did this to me.</v>

1983
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I look back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do more of that.</v>

1984
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:48.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>

1986
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this in the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you heard about Bill Roman Polanski</v>

1987
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 1>created that neuro one supplement</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically because of his football</v>

1988
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:56.600
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the head impacts that he had</v>

1989
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.810
<v Speaker 1>seven memory issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of issues with his brain.</v>

1990
01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the product is,</v>

1991
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1992
01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent me a couple of tubs of it because I</v>

1993
01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 1>talked about it a bunch of times and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that we sell at on</v>

1994
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:10.950
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something I love.</v>

1995
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1996
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.480
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first neutral pick ever tried</v>

1997
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 1>before we created Alpha brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1998
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.730
<v Speaker 1>do you stack them now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1999
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rarely try neuro one,</v>

2000
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 1>but I liked to do different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to do.</v>

2001
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I like to occasionally try Prasad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way into nootropics.</v>

2002
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tried to interest the Tamar Roxy</v>

2003
01:29:32.531 --> 01:29:33.361
<v Speaker 1>arrested him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2004
01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you like the difference?</v>

2005
01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell,</v>

2006
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things about like I</v>

2007
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:40.710
<v Speaker 1>had a conversation with a dude last</v>
<v Speaker 1>night at the comedy store.</v>

2008
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious because the dude was hammered,</v>

2009
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2010
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:49.010
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking tried off a brain,</v>

2011
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2012
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2013
01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define worked.</v>

2014
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking hanging,</v>

2015
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.080
<v Speaker 1>hanging out man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't if it didn't feel any</v>

2016
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:01.621
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2017
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2018
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not like going to make you smarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea behind it is if you're,</v>

2019
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're involved in a task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>

2020
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 1>here's Alpha brain in nootropics are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really critical for me because I rely on</v>

2021
01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 1>my memory a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm doing the UFC it's a big</v>

2022
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:21.330
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly bringing up past fights</v>

2023
01:30:21.331 --> 01:30:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm constantly talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>different situations and transitions and</v>

2024
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens when you do that and it,</v>

2025
01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.360
<v Speaker 1>all these connections that I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make my brain.</v>

2026
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So verbal memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recalling fights,</v>

2027
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:35.340
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New nootropics are critical for that</v>

2028
01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:37.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have anything that</v>

2029
01:30:37.741 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 1>requires your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if it's working?</v>

2030
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have anything that requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to form sentences on the fly,</v>

2031
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:46.440
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if it's working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so?</v>

2032
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he just had a silly idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he thought that he was going to</v>

2033
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:51.570
<v Speaker 1>take this stuff and all of a sudden he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2034
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:53.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm doing with my life.</v>

2035
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the fucking light bulb goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got uploaded from the matrix with some.</v>

2036
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it all,</v>

2037
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:01.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel it,</v>

2038
01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but it was hilarious because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hammered.</v>

2039
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Dude was hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2040
01:31:05.371 --> 01:31:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2041
01:31:06.841 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 1>okay dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2042
01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.710
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Shit faced?</v>

2043
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2044
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Junk.</v>

2045
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2046
01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:16.740
<v Speaker 1>this conversation is going to be weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2047
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not going to remember</v>

2048
01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to do something,</v>

2049
01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 1>it was important and I explained all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that has been shown</v>

2050
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:29.460
<v Speaker 1>clinically in double blind placebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled studies to improve on like</v>

2051
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:32.970
<v Speaker 1>these statistics like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can show it when you can show with</v>

2052
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:36.420
<v Speaker 1>60 people and you could show that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that take it have these effects</v>

2053
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.960
<v Speaker 1>versus the people that don't take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is.</v>

2054
01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:40.650
<v Speaker 1>This is where it will help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

2055
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:44.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to just make you smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for someone who relies on their mind</v>

2056
01:31:44.401 --> 01:31:47.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's for creativity or for me,</v>

2057
01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I like to take it now even before I work</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2058
01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I started doing it before a workout now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm noticing less fatigue.</v>

2059
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:57.660
<v Speaker 1>My mind stays fresh longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in grueling longterm workouts,</v>

2060
01:31:57.661 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a long series of pad workouts.</v>

2061
01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can maintain my concentration like</v>

2062
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 1>deep into the seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighth and ninth round of hitting pads.</v>

2063
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't fade off as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where I can't remember the</v>

2064
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:10.810
<v Speaker 1>combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you get so tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like okay,</v>

2066
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>what is it again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double Jab,</v>

2067
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hook,</v>

2068
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:16.600
<v Speaker 1>right kick step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>

2069
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

2070
01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you're into the left hook and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2071
01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're so tired,</v>

2072
01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't work that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think mental fatigue can contribute</v>

2073
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>to physical fatigue or 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in the his book also talk about</v>

2074
01:32:31.451 --> 01:32:33.970
<v Speaker 1>how ketones are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty much the steady fuel.</v>

2075
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So your brain doesn't bonk because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an unlimited stream of energy</v>

2076
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:40.450
<v Speaker 1>coming in at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hit the window where you run</v>

2077
01:32:40.451 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 1>out of glycogen in your brain as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>master regulator says,</v>

2078
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:45.180
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2079
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:45.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2080
01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:45.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2081
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:45.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2082
01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.650
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a very low supply here.</v>

2083
01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's finite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else is coming in.</v>

2084
01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to downregulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and make you perform like</v>

2085
01:32:54.281 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 1>shit right now in an effort to hold onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we have.</v>

2086
01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:00.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever hit that wall with the</v>

2087
01:33:00.011 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 1>ketones present in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2088
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never been in the key to genic</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

2089
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever fasted for anything?</v>

2090
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

2091
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done that leg work several</v>

2092
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.223
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2093
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean even like fasting is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding.</v>

2094
01:33:16.301 --> 01:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like eating right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2095
01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never consciously decided to fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just pretty cool.</v>

2096
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting experiment</v>

2097
01:33:23.261 --> 01:33:24.094
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2098
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2099
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:26.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to lose.</v>

2100
01:33:26.651 --> 01:33:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Here is nothing is going to fuck me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to give this a shot and</v>

2101
01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:30.664
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>

2102
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I was a little flat yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to push through.</v>

2103
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a elliptical workout was a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>

2104
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:41.490
<v Speaker 1>but nothing huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a required a little more grit,</v>

2105
01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just required me to dig down what I</v>

2106
01:33:44.421 --> 01:33:46.450
<v Speaker 1>would rather just get off that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2107
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And around the 35 minute mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last 10 minutes were pretty</v>

2108
01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 1>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>

2109
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 1>my brain doesn't seem too foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things I was</v>

2110
01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:57.490
<v Speaker 1>concerned with that I go on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd just be stupid.</v>

2111
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Like my brain doesn't work that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd forget what I was talking about,</v>

2112
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:01.720
<v Speaker 1>but what do you do you blend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2113
01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:06.280

<v Speaker 1>blend butter and it just says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on the highest setting and punches into</v>

2175
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:15.490
<v Speaker 1>your setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to flex while you do it.</v>

2176
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the stress of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2177
01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.690
<v Speaker 1>there's hold on to my hand and shoving</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing over and over again with no</v>

2178
01:37:25.691 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like eventually I'm going to feel</v>

2179
01:37:27.881 --> 01:37:30.190
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if I just felt pain the</v>

2180
01:37:30.191 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 1>first time but it'd be very minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got now you got a razor blade in</v>

2181
01:37:35.081 --> 01:37:36.790
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting it in a new test strip.</v>

2182
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Just to double check here and explain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me what this thing is testing for.</v>

2183
01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a little blood on my fingers.</v>

2184
01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want more.</v>

2185
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.840

<v Speaker 2>Barely.</v>

2186
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2192
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.440

<v Speaker 3>is not working.</v>

2193
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2196
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:12.530
<v Speaker 3>We don't want you to just tap it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2197
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:14.480
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking little needle.</v>

2198
01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just shove it in there.</v>

2199
01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.690
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shove it in there.</v>

2200
01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:18.411
<v Speaker 3>Pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2201
01:38:18.411 --> 01:38:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Make yourself bleed a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me a drop.</v>

2202
01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Put her on this bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

2203
01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2204
01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I shoved that all the way in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:38:34.191 --> 01:38:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>

2206
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:36.763
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

2207
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:39.890
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry folks.</v>

2208
01:38:39.891 --> 01:38:40.724
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we got it.</v>

2209
01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.310
<v Speaker 3>We got some sweet blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got a countdown here.</v>

2210
01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Ten seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to tell us your blood</v>

2211
01:38:46.191 --> 01:38:48.770
<v Speaker 3>ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you want to be between zero</v>

2212
01:38:48.771 --> 01:38:49.604
<v Speaker 3>point five.</v>

2213
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2214
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:53.450
<v Speaker 3>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low.</v>

2215
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:54.763
<v Speaker 3>Low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2216
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Low battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low battery or low key ketones.</v>

2217
01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2219
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Let's do another show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bleeding.</v>

2220
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I know we got you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got some good blood here,</v>

2221
01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 3>another strip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep it up.</v>

2222
01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Keep the bloodline open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squeezes bitch.</v>

2223
01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Fucking junk science or go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this bro?</v>

2224
01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Science Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2225
01:39:15.861 --> 01:39:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Science bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro Bro.</v>

2226
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more test here.</v>

2227
01:39:20.691 --> 01:39:21.524
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2228
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2229
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:31.240
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero point one.</v>

2230
01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.550
<v Speaker 3>What does that pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

2231
01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:37.990
<v Speaker 3>You want to be between zero point five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About three point.</v>

2232
01:39:37.991 --> 01:39:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can go higher than that if</v>

2233
01:39:39.461 --> 01:39:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you're like in a really extended fast or</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take exogenous ketones.</v>

2234
01:39:44.210 --> 01:39:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go above three point.</v>

2235
01:39:45.971 --> 01:39:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically zero point five,</v>

2236
01:39:48.071 --> 01:39:50.410
<v Speaker 3>you're in nutritional ketosis given one</v>
<v Speaker 3>more test.</v>

2237
01:39:50.411 --> 01:39:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Just to be sure that this isn't bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not certain.</v>

2238
01:39:52.931 --> 01:39:57.931
<v Speaker 3>I believe you're fucking stupid machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it varies,</v>

2239
01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:00.670
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2240
01:40:00.671 --> 01:40:03.430
<v Speaker 3>If you do it again and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating yeah,</v>

2241
01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:08.490
<v Speaker 3>that would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I'm going to get it.</v>

2242
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Why is that was about all that blood to</v>
<v Speaker 3>step well,</v>

2243
01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.180
<v Speaker 3>because it's got to come in a little dry</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to have it again.</v>

2244
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:32.120
<v Speaker 3>What's the negative of being where he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at at point one?</v>

2245
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stab it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2246
01:40:33.651 --> 01:40:36.470
<v Speaker 3>he's in no man's land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he doesn't have carbohydrates coming</v>

2247
01:40:36.471 --> 01:40:39.680
<v Speaker 3>in right to fuel his body and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>producing ketones.</v>

2248
01:40:39.681 --> 01:40:41.900
<v Speaker 3>So did you work out beforehand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2249
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:44.960
<v Speaker 3>that's why is that just fucking saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should have asked beforehand.</v>

2250
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:48.860
<v Speaker 3>So whatever ketones you have from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mcts your body's using.</v>

2251
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why your blood ketones aren't</v>

2252
01:40:51.261 --> 01:40:53.000
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked out right before I got it.</v>

2253
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 3>It's going to confirm it here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly why.</v>

2255
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.230
<v Speaker 3>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tested,</v>

2256
01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I've been in Ketosis for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested and seen like zero point three</v>

2257
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2258
01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And then I listened to dominic</v>
<v Speaker 3>d'agostino.</v>

2259
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that your body will use with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ketones out.</v>

2260
01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.950
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're producing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an energy source.</v>

2261
01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 3>So you work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to go to fill your body the</v>

2262
01:41:15.071 --> 01:41:18.490
<v Speaker 3>way the blood glucose would have prior</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

2263
01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.760
<v Speaker 3>What is [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means it's cold.</v>

2264
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:24.790
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean machine?</v>

2265
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.653
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2266
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:30.970
<v Speaker 3>It's too cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's too cold machine.</v>

2267
01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 3>The machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The machine is cold.</v>

2268
01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you heat it up?</v>

2269
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Put it in the microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stick it in my armpit when I'm getting</v>

2270
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:38.860
<v Speaker 3>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The machine?</v>

2271
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:40.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just right here.</v>

2272
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.553
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2273
01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:42.510
<v Speaker 3>So warmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2274
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I just prepped myself for nothing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>

2275
01:41:45.011 --> 01:41:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Pick yourself for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are all these things that you're</v>

2276
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:48.760
<v Speaker 3>sticking in there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are all those things?</v>

2277
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:50.860
<v Speaker 3>But these are all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

2278
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:53.170
<v Speaker 3>This is your trash actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your little.</v>

2279
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basket.</v>

2280
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those things in there?</v>

2281
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Those are the bits that poke you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the test strips,</v>

2282
01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.690
<v Speaker 3>but any ways you would do this at night</v>
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>

2283
01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Usually before dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have the highest</v>

2284
01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:09.190
<v Speaker 3>ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if you have a night workout then</v>

2285
01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.500
<v Speaker 3>have at least a couple of soft right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I could see what you get.</v>

2286
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out.</v>

2287
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:15.040
<v Speaker 3>You put the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last trip to you.</v>

2288
01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the written.</v>

2289
01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.113
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good.</v>

2290
01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 3>I've got more at the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2291
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 3>So you carry these around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just do it once a day or how many</v>

2292
01:42:22.001 --> 01:42:24.100
<v Speaker 3>times do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a few bucks a piece,</v>

2293
01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 3>so I usually just do them at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2294
01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.440
<v Speaker 3>when the ketones are highest just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that I'm nutritionally,</v>

2295
01:42:29.441 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 3>they're a mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually worn off by that point,</v>

2296
01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.550
<v Speaker 3>so I can tell like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I producing my own ketones as opposed</v>

2297
01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 3>to just getting it artificially raised</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the MCTs.</v>

2298
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2299
01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to be three point zero.</v>

2300
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 3>If it's zero point five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good,</v>

2301
01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 3>but I will feel the difference when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached the one point.</v>

2302
01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between one point.</v>

2303
01:42:49.451 --> 01:42:50.021
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and two point.</v>

2304
01:42:50.021 --> 01:42:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point.</v>

2305
01:42:51.161 --> 01:42:51.881
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and two point.</v>

2306
01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I zero point one.</v>

2307
01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Zero point one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.680
<v Speaker 3>that's dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't mean anything because you</v>

2309
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 3>just worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm depressed.</v>

2310
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm shooting for though is a</v>

2311
01:43:05.050 --> 01:43:07.170
<v Speaker 3>zero point five or higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything above that,</v>

2312
01:43:07.171 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 3>five or higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you've gotten to one or two.</v>

2313
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I've been above three point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2314
01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:16.141
<v Speaker 3>from fasting or from exogenous ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm on a daily basis between one</v>

2315
01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:17.790
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh and two point.</v>

2316
01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm doing good and that means the</v>

2317
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:25.021
<v Speaker 3>foods I'm putting in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't exceeded my protein limits and</v>

2318
01:43:25.181 --> 01:43:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Claus Gluconeogenesis or any of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like I'm.</v>

2319
01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I've dialed in my nutrition over time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what it is.</v>

2320
01:43:30.641 --> 01:43:31.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just fine tuning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2321
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Like women can process much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates than weekend on a</v>

2322
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:37.800
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really more.</v>

2323
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:38.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more.</v>

2324
01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones and the menstrual cycle or</v>

2325
01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:43.150
<v Speaker 3>because they're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea,</v>

2326
01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.910
<v Speaker 3>but they can get away with way more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could it be evil?</v>

2327
01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Just some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some food.</v>

2328
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:49.940
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what that has meant.</v>

2329
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Wonder if it's because they have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain a higher body fat to make lacto</v>

2330
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>to make milk and to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible feed the baby and grow.</v>

2331
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Titties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tossed.</v>

2332
01:44:01.150 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tosh was in Ketosis the whole time</v>

2333
01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:06.380
<v Speaker 3>during the pregnancy and she still had</v>
<v Speaker 3>plenty of carbohydrates.</v>

2334
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was so it was a conscious</v>

2335
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:12.230
<v Speaker 3>decision to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reach that state during the</v>

2336
01:44:12.231 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 3>pregnancy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

2337
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:13.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2338
01:44:13.661 --> 01:44:14.181
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

2339
01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She asked me like,</v>

2340
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would see where I'm at and I'm like,</v>

2341
01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to waste $3 on you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at zero point zero.</v>

2342
01:44:21.651 --> 01:44:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I just told you what you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2343
01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:23.361
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2344
01:44:23.361 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see like I feel good.</v>

2345
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:26.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

2346
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:28.430
<v Speaker 3>So we did it and she was higher than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2347
01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2348
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:31.190
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it makes perfect sense.</v>

2349
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're sending resources to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build a human right,</v>

2350
01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want that steady flow,</v>

2351
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The body would produce that in a</v>

2352
01:44:39.081 --> 01:44:41.840
<v Speaker 3>situation like that just in case you ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of carbohydrates.</v>

2353
01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting because women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes when they're pregnant,</v>

2354
01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:48.170
<v Speaker 3>they crave a really fatty foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the crave ice cream and things</v>

2355
01:44:48.171 --> 01:44:50.270
<v Speaker 3>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not ketogenic,</v>

2356
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:52.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it has a lot of sugar in it.</v>

2357
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sugar in that.</v>

2358
01:44:53.271 --> 01:44:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your cravings,</v>

2359
01:44:54.411 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 3>your cravings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want to.</v>

2360
01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.000
<v Speaker 3>If there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a calling to have more fat,</v>

2361
01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.990
<v Speaker 3>you want more fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't necessarily mean it's going</v>

2362
01:45:00.991 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 3>to put you in ketosis right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

2363
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:08.660
<v Speaker 3>if you're in this key to genic state and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat some carbohydrates,</v>

2364
01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:12.650
<v Speaker 3>you eat like a big bowl of pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much does it whack you out of that</v>

2365
01:45:12.651 --> 01:45:14.060
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic state?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three to four.</v>

2366
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Three to four days is typically what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would take to get back in bed.</v>

2367
01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because I've been in and out of</v>

2368
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 3>it for as long as I have and because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>work out the way you work out,</v>

2369
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high intensity stuff with kettlebells or</v>

2370
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:29.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll go for a distance from whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then still train on the mat.</v>

2371
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.670
<v Speaker 3>That's high intensity when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>grappling.</v>

2372
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I had a Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went off the deep end.</v>

2373
01:45:37.641 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I had to gluten free pizzas with Tosh</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had a bunch of gluten free</v>

2374
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:46.331
<v Speaker 3>cookies and the fricking leader of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome grass fed milk loaded with carbs</v>

2375
01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.610
<v Speaker 3>and I probably had 500 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>

2376
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Grass fed milk is loaded with carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milk for sure.</v>

2377
01:45:53.241 --> 01:45:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Milk is long period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter if it's aggressive.</v>

2378
01:45:55.670 --> 01:45:57.380
<v Speaker 3>It matters if it's grass fed or grain</v>
<v Speaker 3>fed,</v>

2379
01:45:57.381 --> 01:46:01.070
<v Speaker 3>but not from a carbohydrate standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would think that milk would be a</v>

2380
01:46:01.071 --> 01:46:02.560
<v Speaker 3>source of carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2381
01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Nine to 12 grams per cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have a leader in your,</v>

2382
01:46:05.771 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 3>you have four cups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is easy to do and read and cookies</v>

2383
01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.840
<v Speaker 3>that you just had 50 grams of carbs just</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the milk.</v>

2384
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many grams of carbs?</v>

2385
01:46:13.491 --> 01:46:18.440
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to have a day in a in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diet between 30 and 50 during</v>

2386
01:46:18.441 --> 01:46:21.410
<v Speaker 3>the Keto adaptation phase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is six to eight weeks,</v>

2387
01:46:21.411 --> 01:46:24.500
<v Speaker 3>and then after that you can play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the whole reason you check</v>

2388
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:27.490
<v Speaker 3>because if you're doing 50 grams a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

2389
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going within my limit and you're</v>

2390
01:46:29.271 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 3>still at point three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point four and fuck with somebody else</v>

2391
01:46:32.391 --> 01:46:34.430
<v Speaker 3>tells you that's when it's time to dial</v>
<v Speaker 3>it down a bit.</v>

2392
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2393
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:38.750
<v Speaker 3>my carbohydrates are fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still not in Ketosis.</v>

2394
01:46:38.751 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>That means you're eating too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein or maybe I need to add more fat</v>

2395
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.840
<v Speaker 3>to my meals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ratio is there and they talked</v>

2396
01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:45.830
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Hopkins,</v>

2397
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the kids with epilepsy,</v>

2398
01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>four to one ratio of fat to protein and</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates combined.</v>

2399
01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.550
<v Speaker 3>Now that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty hard to do if you think of</v>

2400
01:46:55.551 --> 01:46:58.920
<v Speaker 3>how many you eat a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 50 grams of protein and there's</v>

2401
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:00.300
<v Speaker 3>equal amount of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

2402
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:04.800
<v Speaker 3>now I have to multiply that by four and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's any carbohydrates to add to</v>

2403
01:47:04.801 --> 01:47:07.230
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then add that to the total for the four</v>

2404
01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 3>to one ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to have just ridiculous</v>

2405
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 3>amounts of fat to to accomplish that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that device called that you just</v>

2406
01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:17.070
<v Speaker 3>use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a blood ketone meter.</v>

2407
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I use the Nova Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is the cheapest.</v>

2408
01:47:19.471 --> 01:47:22.230
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple other ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>five or $6 a strip.</v>

2409
01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:27.030
<v Speaker 3>You can get that on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meter itself is only like 20 bucks</v>

2410
01:47:27.031 --> 01:47:30.330
<v Speaker 3>and then the strips are a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and so the strips,</v>

2411
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you have to use blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there another way to do it?</v>

2412
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:35.850
<v Speaker 3>There is a piss test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't work at all.</v>

2413
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is once your body</v>

2414
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.790
<v Speaker 3>becomes keto adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it learns how to better use these things</v>

2415
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 3>so they're not excreted in the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it tests for acetone,</v>

2416
01:47:45.061 --> 01:47:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I think is a cdot Acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2417
01:47:47.881 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the less prominent ketones</v>
<v Speaker 3>to begin with.</v>

2418
01:47:51.450 --> 01:47:55.290
<v Speaker 3>So when we convert fat into Ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have three major ketone bodies.</v>

2419
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Beta hydroxy butyrate is the one that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you test for with the blood strip that's</v>

2420
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 3>the most 80 percent most abundant in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>

2421
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 3>If you do the urine strip and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body's becoming Keto adapted,</v>

2422
01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:07.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna piss anymore out.</v>

2423
01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:11.460
<v Speaker 3>So you could be completely in</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritional ketosis and use a strip and</v>

2424
01:48:11.461 --> 01:48:12.061
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2425
01:48:12.061 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

2426
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that your body's not wasting</v>

2427
01:48:16.561 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 3>any out of the urine anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they have breast strips or breath.</v>

2428
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 3>The breath meter you can blow into and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't stand the thing.</v>

2429
01:48:24.121 --> 01:48:26.280
<v Speaker 3>I used it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get into it because it's</v>

2430
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 3>obviously you can reuse it at 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>times and it's still going to be the</v>

2431
01:48:30.091 --> 01:48:31.980
<v Speaker 3>same cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2432
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:35.070
<v Speaker 3>it shows like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a gliding scale,</v>

2433
01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.660
<v Speaker 3>like an led light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So green is not in Ketosis,</v>

2434
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 3>red is in Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2435
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:44.340
<v Speaker 3>And then in between you have like green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow and yellow,</v>

2436
01:48:44.341 --> 01:48:46.050
<v Speaker 3>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

2437
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.570
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking hard to read and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to figure out,</v>

2438
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:49.560
<v Speaker 3>well I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2439
01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 3>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2440
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:51.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2441
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Just to do the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

2442
01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480
<v Speaker 3>get me to the 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly where I'm at.</v>

2443
01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you get to all the guests</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout and what exactly is it</v>

2444
01:48:58.591 --> 01:49:00.670
<v Speaker 3>measuring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you say blood ketones.</v>

2445
01:49:00.671 --> 01:49:05.671
<v Speaker 3>So what is the number represent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One millimolar is a measurement of the</v>

2446
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone millimolar</v>
<v Speaker 3>millimolar.</v>

2447
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2448
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:14.610
<v Speaker 3>So you've been doing this for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2449
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:16.920
<v Speaker 3>I've read a ton of books on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

2450
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most diets people,</v>

2451
01:49:18.601 --> 01:49:21.890
<v Speaker 3>I've tried a ton of different diets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one you feel good.</v>

2452
01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 3>You can eat as much as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when Dave aspery talks about eating</v>

2453
01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:26.910
<v Speaker 3>4,500 calories a day and working out</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever he said,</v>

2454
01:49:26.911 --> 01:49:29.760
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes of fucking month or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some nonsense.</v>

2455
01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here you are going to lose weight.</v>

2456
01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm a better example in the four hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

2457
01:49:35.281 --> 01:49:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Tim ferriss talks about the study they</v>
<v Speaker 3>did on calories in,</v>

2458
01:49:37.561 --> 01:49:38.190
<v Speaker 3>calories out.</v>

2459
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 3>I love this study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three,</v>

2460
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.620
<v Speaker 3>three groups of people had 2000 calories</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day.</v>

2461
01:49:44.190 --> 01:49:47.130
<v Speaker 3>One group a 90 percent carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groupie 90 percent,</v>

2462
01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Group C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 percent fat,</v>

2463
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 3>not Shaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carbohydrate group gained one and a half</v>

2464
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 3>pounds a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protein group lost a quarter pound a</v>

2465
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fat Group lost a pound a day,</v>

2466
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 3>90 percent fat in their diet and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost a pound a day up on the same 2000</v>

2467
01:50:04.601 --> 01:50:07.420
<v Speaker 3>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep an think about that.</v>

2468
01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.770
<v Speaker 3>2,000 colors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a lot.</v>

2469
01:50:08.771 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 3>So if you had 200 calories of</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and you're going to gain</v>

2470
01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 3>weight from that and you can gain weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 2000 calories a day.</v>

2471
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's incredible.</v>

2472
01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.370
<v Speaker 3>So there's other factors and things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2473
01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:23.371
<v Speaker 3>but there's that just dispels this</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of all count count calories.</v>

2474
01:50:23.741 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 3>They're all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not the same,</v>

2475
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:28.630
<v Speaker 3>they're not the same at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they impact hormones is not the same</v>

2476
01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 3>hormonal function.</v>

2477
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Insulin response when our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does insulin do?</v>

2478
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stores it shuttles things,</v>

2479
01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:38.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we are constantly inundating</v>

2480
01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 3>ourselves with carbohydrates and in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>store mode,</v>

2481
01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:43.080
<v Speaker 3>any excess is getting put on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2482
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:46.060
<v Speaker 3>How do you tell your body to burn fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which takes a longer,</v>

2483
01:50:46.061 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 3>harder process when you have this easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>super rapid thing,</v>

2484
01:50:49.361 --> 01:50:52.870
<v Speaker 3>it can break down and then use collect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politically it doesn't make sense,</v>

2485
01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:55.810
<v Speaker 3>but when they talked to the instagram</v>
<v Speaker 3>wizards,</v>

2486
01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:56.800
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2487
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.950
<v Speaker 3>these dieticians in training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you,</v>

2488
01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need fucking carbohydrates to</v>

2489
01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 3>operate your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2490
01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the science.</v>

2491
01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I love this too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about science and Eddie</v>

2492
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Bravo would probably like this to Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory guy.</v>

2493
01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who pays for that fucking carbohydrate</v>

2494
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 3>research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gatorade,</v>

2495
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Gatorade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sports Science Institute,</v>

2496
01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Gatorade Sports Science Institute has</v>
<v Speaker 3>done a majority studies.</v>

2497
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Nestle skates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gatorade is gatorade that's doing a lot</v>

2498
01:51:27.431 --> 01:51:29.290
<v Speaker 3>of the studies on carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

2499
01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:31.460
<v Speaker 3>They're the guys that also proved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2500
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:35.020
<v Speaker 3>this is the tipping point for fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidation and an hour even though they</v>

2501
01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:38.290
<v Speaker 3>use people that have been in Ketosis for</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks instead of two years.</v>

2502
01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 3>So when you talk about guys like Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Steve Volvo Cuban doing this</v>

2503
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:47.470
<v Speaker 3>research now since the eighties and</v>
<v Speaker 3>using athletes that have been keto</v>

2504
01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:49.270
<v Speaker 3>adapted for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you really begin to see</v>

2505
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:50.104
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

2506
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:51.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can work.</v>

2507
01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And not just from a physical standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

2508
01:51:53.621 --> 01:51:56.110
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I get mostly from it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mental.</v>

2509
01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:57.760
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the sharpness.</v>

2510
01:51:58.090 --> 01:52:00.310
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominic d'agostino was talking about how</v>

2511
01:52:00.311 --> 01:52:04.660
<v Speaker 3>you can go on way less sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some type of thing that</v>

2512
01:52:04.661 --> 01:52:08.140
<v Speaker 3>ketones do with the brain where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually are more rested.</v>

2513
01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Even if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were sleep deprived.</v>

2514
01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:12.370
<v Speaker 3>So if you had five or six hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

2515
01:52:12.371 --> 01:52:15.850
<v Speaker 3>you can still wake up feeling refreshed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have your sharpness in the morning</v>

2516
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:18.810
<v Speaker 3>rather than being on a heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate intensive diet.</v>

2517
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're not sure the mechanism for</v>

2518
01:52:22.211 --> 01:52:23.044
<v Speaker 3>that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one.</v>

2519
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 3>That's why they got these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these geniuses studying these things,</v>

2520
01:52:25.751 --> 01:52:29.590
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 3>important than when you try something</v>

2521
01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:32.320
<v Speaker 3>and you actually feel the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not me saying like,</v>

2522
01:52:32.321 --> 01:52:33.154
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2523
01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 3>if you're Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2524
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:38.740
<v Speaker 3>If you're Vegan and you feel awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking awesome,</v>

2525
01:52:38.741 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to tell you to change.</v>

2526
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2527
01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 3>you should've had this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2528
01:52:42.101 --> 01:52:42.630
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

2529
01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 3>you've dialed it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's different,</v>

2530
01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>but this for me has worked</v>

2531
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>wonders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2532
01:52:47.091 --> 01:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>there's also awesome and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than awesome.</v>

2533
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:50.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some,</v>

2534
01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>some people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2535
01:52:51.651 --> 01:52:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I've been on this diet and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic,</v>

2536
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to keep it the way it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2537
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.700
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you added a certain thing to your</v>

2538
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>diet or added a little bit more vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>D or adding a little bit more,</v>

2539
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you might feel actually better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I like your idea of what awesome is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times it's like if you</v>

2541
01:53:07.081 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 1>ever have water in your ear and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think everything's okay,</v>

2542
01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I hear,</v>

2543
01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pop,</v>

2544
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it pops and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2545
01:53:13.731 --> 01:53:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I could hear like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you weren't even considering that</v>

2546
01:53:17.071 --> 01:53:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were hearing like shit.</v>

2547
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:22.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what cracks me up about when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people taught and by no means of my,</v>

2548
01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 1>some type of psychedelic pusher or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

2549
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:26.900
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first did Iowaska I was,</v>

2550
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it consumed my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2551
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to stand on a mountain top and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people about this.</v>

2552
01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I want every one of my friends to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2553
01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:36.050
<v Speaker 1>My family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to try this.</v>

2554
01:53:36.051 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I want them to see what I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want them to experience</v>

2555
01:53:38.271 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then over time you realize like,</v>

2556
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've listened to people tie like,</v>

2557
01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want like,</v>

2558
01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.760
<v Speaker 1>life's just so good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need to change anything.</v>

2559
01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a fucking finished product?</v>

2560
01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:52.770
<v Speaker 1>You can't improve your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2561
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mr Manhattan.</v>

2562
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no room for getting better.</v>

2563
01:53:58.401 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for enjoying life more improving really,</v>

2564
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:02.061
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2565
01:54:02.061 --> 01:54:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And that was just funny to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2566
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:06.530
<v Speaker 1>that dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2567
01:54:06.531 --> 01:54:08.930
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people that just say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves like,</v>

2568
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Change?</v>

2569
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well people don't like feeling like shit</v>

2570
01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and they don't like feeling like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses in disarray.</v>

2571
01:54:19.190 --> 01:54:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And so if they get to a state where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2572
01:54:21.201 --> 01:54:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2573
01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's good.</v>

2574
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2575
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy being chubby.</v>

2576
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with being chubby.</v>

2577
01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy right now with the way I am.</v>

2578
01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people will convince themselves all</v>

2579
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I oftentimes read things that people</v>

2580
01:54:37.841 --> 01:54:39.040
<v Speaker 1>write and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

2581
01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this person is expressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves honestly or if they're trying</v>

2582
01:54:42.581 --> 01:54:46.000
<v Speaker 1>to get other people to be convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're okay.</v>

2583
01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You know how I would lean towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2584
01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.630
<v Speaker 1>How happy I brought this article up more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than once,</v>

2585
01:54:52.631 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but I read this article written by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who's 70 years old,</v>

2586
01:54:56.070 --> 01:55:01.070
<v Speaker 1>struggled with weight her whole life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was promoting fat acceptance and</v>

2587
01:55:01.631 --> 01:55:05.230
<v Speaker 1>that people are prejudice towards people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are overweight,</v>

2588
01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but in fact she's incredibly healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so active and she does all these</v>

2589
01:55:09.191 --> 01:55:10.210
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just always,</v>

2590
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:12.100
<v Speaker 1>always been heavy and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

2591
01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:14.860
<v Speaker 1>see scientifically that doesn't make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

2592
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:18.100
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating healthy foods and your</v>

2593
01:55:18.101 --> 01:55:20.860
<v Speaker 1>body's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be storing that much extra</v>

2594
01:55:20.861 --> 01:55:22.150
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't make any sense.</v>

2595
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:25.290
<v Speaker 1>But she's promoting it in this article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you didn't know any better and</v>

2596
01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:27.220
<v Speaker 1>just took this article is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2597
01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:29.680
<v Speaker 1>this is this one woman's account of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2598
01:55:29.681 --> 01:55:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And by her accounts she's incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

2599
01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:36.730
<v Speaker 1>She's hiking and she's so active and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's eating healthy,</v>

2600
01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.840
<v Speaker 1>but she's just fat.</v>

2601
01:55:39.570 --> 01:55:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really make sense?</v>

2602
01:55:41.370 --> 01:55:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know something's missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2603
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

2604
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.230
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2605
01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had this as one of my first</v>

2606
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 3>first breakthroughs and my very first</v>
<v Speaker 3>ceremony I was uh,</v>

2607
01:55:55.980 --> 01:56:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I was hearing people violently puke</v>
<v Speaker 3>around me and I thought I was like in a</v>

2608
01:56:01.111 --> 01:56:03.990
<v Speaker 3>war zone and this is just starting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick in and see me.</v>

2609
01:56:03.991 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I've taken the Second Cup Iowasca and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like people are dying.</v>

2610
01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 3>And I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2611
01:56:09.601 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 3>they're puking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought,</v>

2612
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.670
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because these fuckers didn't do</v>

2613
01:56:14.671 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 3>the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't eat clean.</v>

2614
01:56:16.471 --> 01:56:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to eat a certain way prior</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it not,</v>

2615
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:19.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat clean,</v>

2616
01:56:19.831 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 3>I take care of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people don't take care of</v>

2617
01:56:22.591 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like all that kind of snowballed</v>

2618
01:56:25.021 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 3>into this feeling that I had about fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in general.</v>

2619
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not taking care of yourself.</v>

2620
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:32.280
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you do that to yourself?</v>

2621
01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:33.730
<v Speaker 3>What would you do to your body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2622
01:56:33.731 --> 01:56:38.731
<v Speaker 3>like I've always been thin and athletic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was easy for me to do these</v>

2623
01:56:39.421 --> 01:56:40.370
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm,</v>

2624
01:56:40.371 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 3>when I'm feeling this and I just started</v>
<v Speaker 3>to notice like,</v>

2625
01:56:42.841 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I feel this way,</v>

2626
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.040
<v Speaker 3>why would damn this is getting worse and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

2627
01:56:47.041 --> 01:56:51.570
<v Speaker 3>and then I jumped up and grabbed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket and puked my brains out like I'd</v>

2628
01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:54.510
<v Speaker 3>never puked before and it came out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2629
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:58.350
<v Speaker 3>this feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this animosity towards people and I</v>

2630
01:56:58.351 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 3>understood right then like they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know any better.</v>

2631
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that they don't know any</v>

2632
01:57:07.261 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to get out of that.</v>

2633
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Then even if they do know</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually,</v>

2634
01:57:12.631 --> 01:57:15.570
<v Speaker 3>they haven't internalized it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't adjusted.</v>

2635
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of things that you can</v>

2636
01:57:17.401 --> 01:57:18.470
<v Speaker 3>take at face value.</v>

2637
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 3>You here resonates with you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2638
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:21.930
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes perfect sense.</v>

2639
01:57:22.230 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't assimilate it.</v>

2640
01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Put it into action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think for them,</v>

2641
01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe every time their mom and dad</v>

2642
01:57:29.101 --> 01:57:31.400
<v Speaker 3>fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took them to get ice cream cones</v>

2643
01:57:31.401 --> 01:57:32.580
<v Speaker 3>and McDonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's okay.</v>

2644
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

2645
01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:35.010
<v Speaker 3>we'll go for a car ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be fine.</v>

2646
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Here's an ice cream cone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then now anytime that under stress</v>

2647
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 3>fucking eat ice cream and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even think about it or maybe they do</v>

2648
01:57:40.981 --> 01:57:42.870
<v Speaker 3>know and they still say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>

2649
01:57:42.871 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I know those ice cream I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make me feel better,</v>

2650
01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2651
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:48.210
<v Speaker 3>That's not my place to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey you fat,</v>

2652
01:57:48.211 --> 01:57:49.050
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2653
01:57:49.051 --> 01:57:52.830
<v Speaker 3>like that helped me grow from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a huge.</v>

2654
01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.090
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2655
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:55.440
<v Speaker 3>how could puking be good?</v>

2656
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 3>And that puking is amazing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of something like that.</v>

2657
01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're letting go of a thought that</v>

2658
01:58:01.051 --> 01:58:03.120
<v Speaker 3>you had like this attachment that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

2659
01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2660
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a certain holier than</v>
<v Speaker 3>thou attitude that certain people with</v>

2661
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:14.080
<v Speaker 3>great metabolisms and active lifestyles</v>
<v Speaker 3>will have towards people that maybe they</v>

2662
01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they grew up,</v>

2663
01:58:15.751 --> 01:58:19.380
<v Speaker 3>they weren't led towards athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They maybe they were bullied.</v>

2664
01:58:19.381 --> 01:58:20.214
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2665
01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:23.370
<v Speaker 3>they had poor diets in the home and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know any better.</v>

2666
01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:28.230
<v Speaker 3>And now here they find themselves x</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of years later a product to a</v>

2667
01:58:28.231 --> 01:58:30.990
<v Speaker 3>whole series of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of the impact it would have</v>

2668
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:33.740
<v Speaker 3>always get picked last for kickball or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2669
01:58:33.741 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 3>handball or any of that stupid dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>playground games.</v>

2670
01:58:36.421 --> 01:58:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You're always picked last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to play them anymore.</v>

2671
01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:41.180
<v Speaker 3>You're not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2672
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.200
<v Speaker 3>It's an associate them</v>

2673
01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 1>with bad feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation about this</v>

2674
01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:50.641
<v Speaker 1>with a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was talking about like how there's</v>

2675
01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:56.500
<v Speaker 1>like women that are like angry feminists</v>
<v Speaker 1>that get that truly don't like men.</v>

2676
01:58:56.831 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 1>They hate men and they don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>

2677
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to figure out what that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about and I was like,</v>

2678
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:04.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parallels got to be.</v>

2679
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 1>There's certain men that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like women.</v>

2680
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:10.930
<v Speaker 1>They hate women and one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is because they've been rejected by</v>

2681
01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 1>women their whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they associate women with a negative</v>

2682
01:59:13.991 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They associate women with rejection.</v>

2683
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 1>They associate women with the women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as cold hearted leaves them.</v>

2684
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It goes with another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negotiation do that to me,</v>

2685
01:59:23.471 --> 01:59:24.770
<v Speaker 1>that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2686
01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't owe you.</v>

2687
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:28.150
<v Speaker 1>She's not attracted to you like you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

2688
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason the universe dealt</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and extremely shitty deck of cards</v>

2689
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's just the way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so forever this person that I know</v>

2690
01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 1>that that has this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his association with women is of women.</v>

2691
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:45.640
<v Speaker 1>The use him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want things from him.</v>

2692
01:59:45.641 --> 01:59:47.980
<v Speaker 1>His money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want him and they treat him</v>

2693
01:59:47.981 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 1>badly and he feels like shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful.</v>

2694
01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I have friends that are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking guys that for no,</v>

2695
01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:59.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just born good looking.</v>

2696
01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:02.230
<v Speaker 1>They just got great bone structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2697
02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they happen to look good and women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to them and their ideas of</v>

2698
02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>women are totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their ideas of women are.</v>

2699
02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>The chicks are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grade don't get tied down though,</v>

2700
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:12.454
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2701
02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it moving.</v>

2702
02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their ideas of women are much more</v>

2703
02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>light and like women are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a gift.</v>

2704
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>There are a great thing in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not this evil to.</v>

2705
02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So there's like this association can</v>
<v Speaker 1>often be correlated by what kind of a</v>

2706
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>relationship do you have with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex.</v>

2707
02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a woman and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight and you're,</v>

2708
02:00:35.230 --> 02:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've always been fat,</v>

2709
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>your whole life has been like a series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of drunken moments with men who felt</v>

2710
02:00:42.041 --> 02:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>sick after they were with you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were rejected and any man that you were</v>

2711
02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>attracted to at wanted to have nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with you.</v>

2712
02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>So your feelings about men are just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the angriest assholes.</v>

2713
02:00:54.161 --> 02:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>These Bros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these douchebags not taking into</v>

2714
02:00:58.051 --> 02:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>consideration like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2715
02:00:59.410 --> 02:01:01.630
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this relationship you have with</v>

2716
02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>them and what's the root cause of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is outside of your.</v>

2717
02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>If it's just genetics completely outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your control,</v>

2718
02:01:08.441 --> 02:01:12.430
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do about the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face looks or how tall you are,</v>

2719
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>how short you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2720
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>how big your feet are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2721
02:01:15.731 --> 02:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the relationship between how,</v>

2722
02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>what you look and how physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive you are sexually,</v>

2723
02:01:24.730 --> 02:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>like people's desire to reproduce with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2724
02:01:26.770 --> 02:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It really comes down to that in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

2725
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the relationship you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the opposite sex?</v>

2726
02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Because boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2727
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>when you go in and really pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like hardcore,</v>

2728
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>what you find is a lot of older</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful women and women that are</v>

2729
02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>overweight and not attractive and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>

2730
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different people in between</v>

2731
02:01:51.591 --> 02:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an overwhelming number of</v>

2732
02:01:54.081 --> 02:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>people that have not had good success</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the opposite sex,</v>

2733
02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>both from women hating men and for men</v>
<v Speaker 1>hating women and it's like this is an</v>

2734
02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:05.170
<v Speaker 1>extremely unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2735
02:02:05.171 --> 02:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely unfortunate.</v>

2736
02:02:07.461 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Like taking out gender inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial issues,</v>

2737
02:02:11.301 --> 02:02:16.301
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of issues that also come with</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a male men's rights advocate or a</v>

2738
02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>woman's rights advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feminist.</v>

2739
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

2740
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>an overall attitude that people have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with when it comes to someone who</v>

2741
02:02:25.221 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>identifies with one gender or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender and despise the other gender.</v>

2742
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes it's because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>associations and relationships with that</v>

2743
02:02:33.381 --> 02:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>gender have been negative due to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they're not desired.</v>

2744
02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>That it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to them.</v>

2745
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And so what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing for yourself?</v>

2746
02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>What is your relationship with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>part?</v>

2747
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>With the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex certainly has to do with that,</v>

2748
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>but what is your relationship in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have this assumption that all</v>

2749
02:02:51.261 --> 02:02:56.261
<v Speaker 1>dudes are dicks and they all behave the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way and in that it's kind of your</v>

2750
02:02:57.111 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>mindset can keep you stuck in that whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the same.</v>

2751
02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're always thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly how they are,</v>

2752
02:03:02.691 --> 02:03:04.310
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what it's going to</v>

2753
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.440
<v Speaker 1>reciprocate itself over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

2754
02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're always correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2755
02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also the reality,</v>

2756
02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like my friend who doesn't live was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend anymore,</v>

2757
02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but who doesn't like women?</v>

2758
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.710
<v Speaker 1>He's an ugly dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's gonna be an ugly dude.</v>

2759
02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He'd see like porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he like,</v>

2760
02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>does he like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2761
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets angry,</v>

2762
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>he gets angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2763
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it never has a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never been married.</v>

2764
02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>He's just like always like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds to me like a guy who used to</v>

2765
02:03:33.231 --> 02:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>work on himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2766
02:03:34.421 --> 02:03:37.850
<v Speaker 1>he definitely does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like the girls that he</v>

2767
02:03:37.851 --> 02:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd never really were into.</v>

2768
02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just just not attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to shit roll the dice is roll</v>

2769
02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>the dice sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know where I'm going with this.</v>

2770
02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:49.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2771
02:03:49.921 --> 02:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to say is I'm not trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say anything,</v>

2772
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but if I was trying to say anything I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would try to say like there's,</v>

2773
02:03:56.050 --> 02:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of complex issues that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with how people feel about</v>

2774
02:04:01.911 --> 02:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>themselves and how they feel about other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2775
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes what they blame other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for is really some shit that's</v>

2776
02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:11.300
<v Speaker 1>going on with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they find enemies out there</v>

2777
02:04:11.301 --> 02:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>external enemies to distract themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their internal problems and</v>

2778
02:04:15.501 --> 02:04:20.180
<v Speaker 1>failures and shortcomings big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you find that a lot with haters.</v>

2779
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you found that when you've read</v>
<v Speaker 1>like horrible shit that people write</v>

2780
02:04:24.441 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 1>about you online like after fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dude,</v>

2781
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of hate that is available to</v>

2782
02:04:31.851 --> 02:04:36.851
<v Speaker 1>fighters is some of the most fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious and personal and emotional.</v>

2783
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>The people that go after them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quote unquote fans.</v>

2784
02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them is a loser.</v>

2785
02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of them.</v>

2786
02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking evil nasty Douche bag that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeks you out to say mean shit to you</v>

2787
02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:55.200
<v Speaker 1>after a loss and tweets at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2788
02:04:55.201 --> 02:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen some horrific shit that</v>

2789
02:04:58.460 --> 02:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>guy's right.</v>

2790
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Two fighters directly after a loss both</v>
<v Speaker 1>on facebook and on instagram,</v>

2791
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2792
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Those people are all unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all failures.</v>

2793
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason why they would do</v>

2794
02:05:10.951 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to say,</v>

2795
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that fucking guy,</v>

2799
02:05:20.401 --> 02:05:24.120
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like almost a analytical</v>

2800
02:05:24.121 --> 02:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>discussions that you have with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>where things happen and you didn't see a</v>

2801
02:05:27.001 --> 02:05:28.230

<v Speaker 1>It's like they're looking at this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

02:06:18.181 --> 02:06:22.980
<v Speaker 1>this object that they can attack and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're externalizing all the issues</v>

2822
02:06:22.981 --> 02:06:26.310
<v Speaker 1>they have with themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imbalances they have,</v>

2823
02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and then this new ability that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach people and communicate with</v>

2824
02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>people that really don't want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with you.</v>

2825

<v Speaker 1>I know so many fighters just don't go on</v>

2836
02:06:52.471 --> 02:06:55.140
<v Speaker 1>social media now because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2837
02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:56.830
<v Speaker 1>you would think photos are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should feel.</v>

2838
02:06:56.831 --> 02:06:57.664
<v Speaker 1>Could toughen up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2839
02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just a con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not.</v>

2840
02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Fighters are tough and they should just</v>
<v Speaker 1>toughen up.</v>

2841
02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2842
02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you're being shitty to someone you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know.</v>

2843
02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I going with this?</v>

2844
02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree.</v>

2845
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I've even when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we forget who it was,</v>

2846
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:20.850
<v Speaker 1>green flower media did a thing on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about cannabis and cbd and how</v>

2847
02:07:20.851 --> 02:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>many guys in the sport use and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>showing it,</v>

2849
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but talking about a lot of smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it helps us sleep at night helps</v>

2850
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 1>turn off our brain when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>overthinking shit and you got something</v>

2851
02:07:32.821 --> 02:07:37.821
<v Speaker 1>big coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than obviously now with Usada</v>

<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot less,</v>

2853
02:07:39.401 --> 02:07:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2854
02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of us out of</v>

2855

<v Speaker 1>week of the fight.</v>

2858
02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is good news for me to tell to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people.</v>

2859
02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:54.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2860
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:58.180
<v Speaker 1>we did that video and then sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was going to get</v>

2861
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:00.280
<v Speaker 1>decent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it went big,</v>

2862
02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>but Bj Penn Dot com ran it and it made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bigger than it was.</v>

2863
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom of the video,</v>

2864
02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>everyone's comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got like two or three guys.</v>

2865
02:08:09.771 --> 02:08:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2866
02:08:10.921 --> 02:08:14.590
<v Speaker 1>this is a site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2867
02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It didn't help him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2868
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>with Jimmy men will pay a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashed his face and did it.</v>

2869
02:08:19.301 --> 02:08:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't smoked that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2870
02:08:20.471 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

2871
02:08:21.431 --> 02:08:22.800
<v Speaker 1>like how does this have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2872
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:25.600
<v Speaker 1>with what we're talking about here has</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with anything.</v>

2873
02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2874
02:08:26.891 --> 02:08:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me allow me to,</v>

2875
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:30.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to knock it down here.</v>

2876
02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>A couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of pegs.</v>

2877
02:08:32.111 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're talking,</v>

2878
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's also people that don't</v>

2879
02:08:35.291 --> 02:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>recognize what they're doing and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2880
02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>they're just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2881
02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>just making noises and they're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not evil,</v>

2882
02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:47.380
<v Speaker 1>they just don't realize what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is hurtful or stupid or idiotic</v>

2883
02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:51.220
<v Speaker 1>because they've been given this access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people that's unprecedented.</v>

2884
02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:53.460
<v Speaker 1>There's no training for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one,</v>

2885
02:08:53.490 --> 02:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>no one had anything like social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our parents' days.</v>

2886
02:08:56.051 --> 02:08:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they never taught us about it.</v>

2887
02:08:59.501 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about having kids,</v>

2888
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.870
<v Speaker 1>like I look at bear now and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck dude,</v>

2889
02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:08.680
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grew up when you had wired telephones</v>

2890
02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and then we saw a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zach Morris cell phones come into play</v>

2891
02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.950
<v Speaker 1>and we had the car phone and like things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2892
02:09:14.951 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just this evolution over time,</v>

2893
02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:20.590
<v Speaker 1>like they're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not knowing a world without</v>

2894
02:09:20.591 --> 02:09:22.780
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without instant access.</v>

2895
02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2896
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:25.231
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bar,</v>

2897
02:09:25.231 --> 02:09:27.700
<v Speaker 1>remember when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to take a boat to get here from</v>

2898
02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2899
02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grew up in a much more technically</v>

2900
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>technologically advanced era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our kids are going to grow up in an</v>

2901
02:09:34.151 --> 02:09:39.151
<v Speaker 1>era that's mind blowing to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their kids are gonna grow up in an</v>

2902
02:09:39.191 --> 02:09:42.280
<v Speaker 1>era of virtual reality that makes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like a joke.</v>

2903
02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It makes our video games like stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2904
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's always brag about how awesome</v>

2905
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:48.460
<v Speaker 1>mafia three was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2906
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:51.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to sit in front of a box like I'm</v>

2907
02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:53.180
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking Star Trek Room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2908
02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Surrounded by killers right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:09:55.211 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 1>We're probably going to go to places</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like those old swartz and egg or</v>

2910
02:09:58.781 --> 02:10:01.180
<v Speaker 1>movies or any of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to probably go to a place.</v>

2911
02:10:01.330 --> 02:10:04.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to lie down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to clamp some shit down on</v>

2912
02:10:04.271 --> 02:10:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the side of your head and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you ready,</v>

2913
02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kingsberry give me the thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're ready to launch and you give</v>

2914
02:10:09.911 --> 02:10:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually you're in the avatar world</v>

2915
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 1>and you're riding a fucking dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2916
02:10:15.010 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>That's Gunna happen inside of the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>

2917
02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a 100 percent going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time.</v>

2918
02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:24.880
<v Speaker 1>If they keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't blow ourselves up.</v>

2919
02:10:24.881 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 1>We don't get hit by an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come up with artificial</v>

2920
02:10:27.881 --> 02:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>reality that is indistinguishable from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this reality and all of our</v>

2921
02:10:31.391 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>entertainment is going to be a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2922
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.430
<v Speaker 1>why would you actually jump out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane and go skydiving when you can get</v>

2923
02:10:37.431 --> 02:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the skydiving experience with this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your head.</v>

2924
02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna make you feel like you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that movie a</v>

2925
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:47.900
<v Speaker 1>total recall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strange days.</v>

2926
02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2927
02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fit into it and they had like</v>

2928
02:10:50.721 --> 02:10:55.721
<v Speaker 1>snuff videos where a guy would actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill somebody and you felt what he felt</v>

2929
02:10:55.731 --> 02:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>when he killed another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you felt all the neurotransmitters.</v>

2930
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Everything was going through your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the heart racing feeling of actually</v>

2931
02:11:02.571 --> 02:11:05.780
<v Speaker 1>ending someone's life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the illegal portion of it.</v>

2932
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Then they had the legal portion would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sex with your loved one or</v>

2933
02:11:09.171 --> 02:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2934
02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could actually tap into the</v>

2935
02:11:12.771 --> 02:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of someone's memory as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as that was recorded.</v>

2936
02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely gonna happen.</v>

2937
02:11:20.190 --> 02:11:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time if they keep</v>

2938
02:11:22.881 --> 02:11:27.200
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of one invention and one</v>

2939
02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:31.850
<v Speaker 1>discovery makes way for another</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention and another discovery that</v>

2940
02:11:31.851 --> 02:11:34.190
<v Speaker 1>compound on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They build on each other.</v>

2941
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is unrecognizable.</v>

2942
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Like the reality that we experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2943
02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about these primitive</v>

2944
02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:44.590
<v Speaker 1>diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primal existence and you know,</v>

2945
02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:47.150
<v Speaker 1>how our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind all of this is obviously</v>

2946
02:11:47.151 --> 02:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>that our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes thousands of years.</v>

2947
02:11:50.361 --> 02:11:54.620
<v Speaker 1>They say about 10,000 years for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes to totally change and adapt to new</v>

2948
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:55.790
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new environment,</v>

2949
02:11:55.791 --> 02:11:59.300
<v Speaker 1>new lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're dealing with bodies that</v>

2950
02:11:59.301 --> 02:12:03.950
<v Speaker 1>are primarily adjusted to a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherer lifestyle and all this other</v>

2951
02:12:03.951 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we've added into it over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 10,</v>

2952
02:12:06.021 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 1>20,000 years or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>

2953
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:11.420
<v Speaker 1>grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing different foods that you could</v>

2954
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:14.450
<v Speaker 1>keep them in storage bins and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2955
02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:15.380
<v Speaker 1>like grain silos.</v>

2956
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:18.500
<v Speaker 1>That's all fairly reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and you know,</v>

2957
02:12:18.501 --> 02:12:20.540
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can live like that for sure.</v>

2958
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grains or.</v>

2959
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:22.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can eat it,</v>

2960
02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:25.880
<v Speaker 1>but what is your body like optimized</v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

2961
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.160
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your body exists with the least</v>

2962
02:12:28.161 --> 02:12:30.110
<v Speaker 1>amount of hiccups?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2963
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the stuff that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

2964
02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.950
<v Speaker 1>like clean and normal like fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

2965
02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.180
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

2966
02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:41.420
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that we haven't fucked with</v>

2967
02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:43.190
<v Speaker 1>farm raised this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2968
02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:43.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2969
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Farm raised fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating genetically modified soybeans and</v>

2970
02:12:47.571 --> 02:12:48.404
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2971
02:12:48.450 --> 02:12:51.830
<v Speaker 1>just what's the most realist food we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on our body.</v>

2972
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:52.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2973
02:12:52.721 --> 02:12:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably go camping and shit too,</v>

2974
02:12:54.621 --> 02:12:55.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

2975
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2976
02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:58.880
<v Speaker 1>You know that feeling you get when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out in the woods when you don't,</v>

2977
02:12:58.881 --> 02:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any cell phone signal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any ala mushrooms that too.</v>

2978
02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's extreme.</v>

2979
02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:07.730
<v Speaker 1>But just even being alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you hear the</v>

2980
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:11.240
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing.</v>

2981
02:13:11.241 --> 02:13:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You hear the real nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real nothing of the woods.</v>

2982
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like scary because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>

2983
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>this forest doesn't give a fuck about</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2984
02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:24.170
<v Speaker 1>If a tree falls in your head and you die</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

2985
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the forest doesn't skip a beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The squirrels and chipmunks keep running</v>

2986
02:13:27.981 --> 02:13:28.820
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The birds.</v>

2987
02:13:28.821 --> 02:13:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Keep flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deer keep running.</v>

2988
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally does not matter does it?</v>

2989
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 1>It's been like this before you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be like this.</v>

2990
02:13:36.001 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Unless we fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like this after you.</v>

2991
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 1>This is just the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we fuck it up,</v>

2992
02:13:40.291 --> 02:13:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it'll go back to that at some point or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something different and it'll become</v>

2993
02:13:43.651 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some some new form of nature,</v>

2994
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but you go from that to like cities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities have this bizarre,</v>

2995
02:13:52.351 --> 02:13:53.700
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of life.</v>

2996
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in Manhattan last weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awesome.</v>

2997
02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd go there.</v>

2998
02:13:59.190 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going from one place to another</v>

2999
02:14:01.891 --> 02:14:06.480
<v Speaker 1>in this restaurant that building and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this view and Holy Shit and get</v>

3000
02:14:06.481 --> 02:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>on a subway and you're cruising along</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the buildings and it's awesome,</v>

3001
02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:13.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's awesome in a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

3002
02:14:13.771 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this new way,</v>

3003
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:17.670
<v Speaker 1>this new bizarre way that we're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapting to,</v>

3004
02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this new way is available to us and</v>

3005
02:14:22.021 --> 02:14:24.060
<v Speaker 1>wasn't available to people 10,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3006
02:14:24.061 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 1>This was a mindblower if you took</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone from 10,000 years ago and</v>

3007
02:14:27.811 --> 02:14:32.811
<v Speaker 1>brought on a Manhattan and just put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like the 72nd floor of one of those</v>

3008
02:14:32.881 --> 02:14:35.550
<v Speaker 1>apartment buildings with the crazy view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look out,</v>

3009
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:36.930
<v Speaker 1>look out at the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>

3010
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:40.350
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck am I seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3011
02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:42.810
<v Speaker 1>like you've been to vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been like the top of,</v>

3012
02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:44.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mandalay bay,</v>

3013
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:48.060
<v Speaker 1>that bar that's up there that has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy view and the glass floor.</v>

3014
02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3015
02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:52.410
<v Speaker 1>He just look out at the top of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

3016
02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3017
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:56.190
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like some,</v>

3018
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:57.860
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3019
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:03.480
<v Speaker 3>We're experiencing something that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no cultures ever experienced.</v>

3020
02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:06.930
<v Speaker 3>We're experiencing something that no</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation has ever experienced this.</v>

3021
02:15:06.931 --> 02:15:10.860
<v Speaker 3>The technological heights that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in and this ain't shit compared</v>

3022
02:15:10.861 --> 02:15:12.150
<v Speaker 3>to what our kids are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

3023
02:15:12.210 --> 02:15:12.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3024
02:15:12.661 --> 02:15:16.550
<v Speaker 3>hopefully there are intelligent people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Marxists on another,</v>

3025
02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:20.100
<v Speaker 3>guys that continue to push the envelope</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reconnect.</v>

3026
02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there is a reason that we feel</v>

3027
02:15:22.951 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 3>amazing at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone has access to the beach,</v>

3028
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:29.580
<v Speaker 3>but there's a reason we feel amazing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beach and scientifically they're</v>

3029
02:15:29.581 --> 02:15:32.220
<v Speaker 3>showing now with negative ions and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

3030
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.850
<v Speaker 3>the energy of the earth like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has an impact on how we feel the</v>

3031
02:15:35.851 --> 02:15:38.670
<v Speaker 3>beach does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ocean does for sure.</v>

3032
02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:42.650
<v Speaker 3>The wind coming off the ocean does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if you were on a boat out over</v>

3033
02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:45.240
<v Speaker 3>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel better just from</v>

3034
02:15:45.241 --> 02:15:46.074
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

3035
02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what specifically does it do to</v>

3036
02:15:48.331 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what I read and I understand there</v>

3037
02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>are an abundance of negative ions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so from an electrical standpoint,</v>

3038
02:15:55.470 --> 02:16:00.470
<v Speaker 3>you're talking again about the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy field and auras and shallcross</v>

3039
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:03.390
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chakra here.</v>

3040
02:16:03.391 --> 02:16:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Just going to feel more alive like</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

3041
02:16:05.731 --> 02:16:09.480
<v Speaker 3>every part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't describe like from a feeling</v>

3042
02:16:09.481 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 3>standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has their experience at the</v>

3043
02:16:11.341 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 3>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from an electrical standpoint you</v>

3044
02:16:13.801 --> 02:16:16.680
<v Speaker 3>would say like you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're clearing out blockages from your</v>

3045
02:16:16.681 --> 02:16:18.540
<v Speaker 3>ci,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a Chinese medicine standpoint,</v>

3046
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:22.620
<v Speaker 3>from a Kundalini and yoga standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to clear out blockages the</v>

3047
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 3>same way and you're just are those</v>
<v Speaker 3>blockages are the is this is a really a</v>

3048
02:16:26.371 --> 02:16:31.371
<v Speaker 3>blockage or you just experiencing from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean and it feels good.</v>

3049
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Maybe both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there is no blockage,</v>

3050
02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 3>but I'm willing to bet from somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 3>sits too long or has stressed,</v>

3051
02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and different things like that.</v>

3052
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Like they're very much can be a physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>attachment to emotion and if you've ever</v>

3053
02:16:44.921 --> 02:16:48.310
<v Speaker 3>had like bodywork done or somebody you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

3054
02:16:48.570 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is working to and not and you</v>

3055
02:16:50.141 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden start thinking of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that's been bothering you in your</v>

3056
02:16:53.381 --> 02:16:55.360
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a relationship,</v>

3057
02:16:55.361 --> 02:16:58.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there is physical attachments to</v>

3058
02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:00.580
<v Speaker 3>mental and emotional things that go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>

3059
02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3060
02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:07.120
<v Speaker 3>So when you get a massage and like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a knot and they work through it,</v>

3061
02:17:07.210 --> 02:17:09.070
<v Speaker 3>you think there's emotions tied up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3062
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not always,</v>

3063
02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3064
02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3065
02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.230
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>

3066
02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it would manifest</v>

3067
02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:19.930
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why we have an electrical</v>

3068
02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:24.100
<v Speaker 3>field that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that there's emotions</v>

3069
02:17:24.101 --> 02:17:26.980
<v Speaker 3>tied up in knots in your body.</v>

3070
02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I think when you get rid of those knots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it relaxes you and that helps you deal</v>

3071
02:17:30.641 --> 02:17:32.590
<v Speaker 3>with emotions better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3072
02:17:32.650 --> 02:17:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we went down the wrong path there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

3073
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Say Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

3074
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:39.950
<v Speaker 3>From a feel good standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling better at the ocean might just</v>

3075
02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:42.190
<v Speaker 3>be the view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from an electrical standpoint,</v>

3076
02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:44.380
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this one goes back to the studies</v>

3077
02:17:44.381 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 3>done at Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there very much is an electrical</v>

3078
02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 3>standpoint that that changes from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ionic energy coming from the waves</v>

3079
02:17:50.981 --> 02:17:53.440
<v Speaker 3>coming from the water coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind that's above the water,</v>

3080
02:17:53.710 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like yoga talk,</v>

3081
02:17:55.841 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 3>they'll say shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this hip opener is gonna.</v>

3082
02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Make you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better about your childhood.</v>

3083
02:18:01.361 --> 02:18:03.750
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Open up emotional blockages and you're</v>

3084
02:18:03.751 --> 02:18:06.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure we're just stretching.</v>

3085
02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's just talking about root</v>

3086
02:18:08.291 --> 02:18:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Chakra and exactly how the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chakras work,</v>

3087
02:18:11.021 --> 02:18:12.730
<v Speaker 3>what they correlate to and things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3088
02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know necessarily in a visionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

3089
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I can see energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see colors.</v>

3090
02:18:19.931 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3091
02:18:20.831 --> 02:18:22.600
<v Speaker 3>here's my heart Chakra or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3092
02:18:22.601 --> 02:18:25.180
<v Speaker 3>But I have seen trees communicate to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

3093
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:29.740
<v Speaker 3>like vibrations coming from the treetops</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they were talking to one another.</v>

3094
02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:31.150
<v Speaker 3>What is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like?</v>

3095
02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ripples and water,</v>

3096
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:39.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's the air that's rippling and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could see like perfect circles coming</v>

3097
02:18:39.610 --> 02:18:41.950
<v Speaker 3>from the tops of the tree tops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something I tweeted the other</v>

3098
02:18:41.951 --> 02:18:42.784
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3099
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:47.200
<v Speaker 3>they found that Venus fly traps do</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculations.</v>

3100
02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:53.040
<v Speaker 3>They count like for some study they</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out some,</v>

3101
02:18:53.410 --> 02:18:56.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some method of measuring the fact that</v>

3102
02:18:56.830 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 3>they actually count things there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing calculations like that.</v>

3103
02:19:02.350 --> 02:19:03.570
<v Speaker 3>They're not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3104
02:19:03.590 --> 02:19:06.050
<v Speaker 3>there is an intelligence plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>

3105
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:08.910
<v Speaker 3>that's what I left at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument from vegans on,</v>

3106
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:12.940
<v Speaker 3>from from a consciousness standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever spark we have,</v>

3107
02:19:12.970 --> 02:19:15.890
<v Speaker 3>call it soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call it whatever plants have it,</v>

3108
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:16.833
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3109
02:19:16.930 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Whatever animates us and gives us</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

3110
02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:22.810
<v Speaker 3>It's in them too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3111
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:24.100
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3112
02:19:24.101 --> 02:19:24.934
<v Speaker 3>Is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

3113
02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:27.500
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't communicate in a that we can</v>

3114
02:19:27.501 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 3>clearly understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't bark at us,</v>

3115
02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:31.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't look at us with sad puppy dog</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

3116
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but there's something alive in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some strange way that they communicate</v>

3117
02:19:36.681 --> 02:19:40.910
<v Speaker 3>and that they absorb energy and life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get that from them.</v>

3118
02:19:40.911 --> 02:19:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life eats life.</v>

3119
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:45.860
<v Speaker 3>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know many people that have had a</v>

3120
02:19:45.890 --> 02:19:48.350
<v Speaker 3>visionary experiences and became Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>

3121
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually,</v>

3122
02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:56.360
<v Speaker 3>that's actually really common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in people that do multiple</v>

3123
02:19:56.361 --> 02:20:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Iowaska ceremonies and I had a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My only vision I've ever had a bears.</v>

3124
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I had a vision of seeing a panda bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>eats bamboo and then I saw a black bear</v>

3125
02:20:04.971 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 3>eating berries and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>

3126
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:07.393
<v Speaker 3>am I going to be Vegan?</v>

3127
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw grizzly snatch and salmon</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and I was like,</v>

3128
02:20:10.611 --> 02:20:13.610
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was just the eat the natural,</v>

3129
02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:15.440
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no right or wrong,</v>

3130
02:20:15.441 --> 02:20:17.720
<v Speaker 3>but eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take from take from me.</v>

3131
02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:19.760
<v Speaker 3>This is mother earth talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take from me.</v>

3132
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it was.</v>

3133
02:20:22.011 --> 02:20:22.910
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is right.</v>

3134
02:20:22.911 --> 02:20:25.280
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every animal needs different things.</v>

3135
02:20:25.281 --> 02:20:29.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always these front of Erin</v>

<v Speaker 3>gorilla and he's like,</v>

3137

3141
02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:43.250
<v Speaker 3>there's no right or wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not going to go to the,</v>

3142
02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:44.540
<v Speaker 3>to the line and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're doing this all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lion here.</v>

3144
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:48.040

3146
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.020
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's from nature,</v>

3147
02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:54.050
<v Speaker 3>besides take it is a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

3148
02:20:54.250 --> 02:20:55.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not a person like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3149
02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 3>they have a chemical standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to break down things.</v>

3150
02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.450
<v Speaker 3>We can't break down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just depends on added to our debt</v>

3151
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.730
<v Speaker 3>so that people love that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3152
02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:09.800
<v Speaker 3>strong grills are bro Roots Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go pull shit out of a</v>

3153
02:21:09.801 --> 02:21:11.720
<v Speaker 3>swamp?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And eat the stem,</v>

3154
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.990
<v Speaker 3>like the chew on stems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else do they do?</v>

3155
02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:17.330
<v Speaker 3>They also have one inch dicks about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3156
02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:19.950
<v Speaker 3>A lot of bad things about being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gorilla.</v>

3157
02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that um,</v>

3158
02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:27.560
<v Speaker 3>factory farming is something that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize a lot when they have</v>

3159
02:21:27.561 --> 02:21:31.580
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The connection between the suffering of</v>

3160
02:21:31.581 --> 02:21:33.830
<v Speaker 3>their food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's real.</v>

3161
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I've had multiple versions of that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3162
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:38.090
<v Speaker 3>That's as real as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multiple.</v>

3163
02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you watched that and</v>

3164
02:21:40.401 --> 02:21:41.660
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3165
02:21:41.661 --> 02:21:42.650
<v Speaker 3>like you're watching a movie.</v>

3166
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:44.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not like watching the cove and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington,</v>

3167
02:21:44.541 --> 02:21:47.090
<v Speaker 3>the cove is hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you experience it,</v>

3168
02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you feel what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You embody that consciousness.</v>

3169
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3170
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:55.190
<v Speaker 3>they know they're all fucking aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not just these dumb things like</v>

3171
02:21:55.350 --> 02:21:58.580
<v Speaker 3>we're going to need some whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 3>provide for me.</v>

3172
02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my buddies on the chopping block,</v>

3173
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:02.630
<v Speaker 3>like I'm stuck here shoulder to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder.</v>

3174
02:22:02.631 --> 02:22:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Like you feel you can feel that and tap</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>

3175
02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:08.630
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop that.</v>

3176
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be ingrained in our idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of feeding cities.</v>

3177
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:19.210
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the only way they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce enough meat to feed all these</v>

3178
02:22:19.551 --> 02:22:22.970
<v Speaker 3>fucking people in these cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're doing it now is to</v>

3179
02:22:22.971 --> 02:22:27.730
<v Speaker 3>continue this factory farming method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just terrific.</v>

3180
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:32.400
<v Speaker 3>In the movie food inc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome documentary and the end is hey,</v>

3181
02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:33.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3182
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:34.320
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked.</v>

3183
02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:35.850
<v Speaker 3>WhAt do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do now?</v>

3184
02:22:35.851 --> 02:22:39.540
<v Speaker 3>You do vote with your dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every time you say,</v>

3185
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:43.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't even taste the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between free range eggs and these caged</v>

3186
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:45.300
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to save a few bucks.</v>

3187
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:48.630
<v Speaker 3>You vote with your dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you spend a little extra,</v>

3188
02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:52.170
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel better from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also you're going to help change the</v>

3189
02:22:52.171 --> 02:22:55.770
<v Speaker 3>culture and they show walmart show</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a organic,</v>

3190
02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:59.160
<v Speaker 3>a yogurt or something on the shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because there's demand there.</v>

3191
02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you go into costco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here in California,</v>

3192
02:23:01.470 --> 02:23:06.470
<v Speaker 3>they have all kinds of organic shit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>costco and mass produced widescale for</v>

3193
02:23:07.681 --> 02:23:11.550
<v Speaker 3>cheap because there's a demand for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go there and Arizona and Nevada</v>

3194
02:23:11.610 --> 02:23:13.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3195
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.520
<v Speaker 3>like whole foods is going to have whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>

3196
02:23:14.521 --> 02:23:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from giant companies like that they're</v>

3197
02:23:19.141 --> 02:23:22.500
<v Speaker 3>listening and it's just a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money that people are willing to spend</v>

3198
02:23:22.501 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 3>it and this is what they want.</v>

3199
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:24.900
<v Speaker 3>They're going to supply it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

3200
02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also those ag ag gag laws</v>

3201
02:23:28.201 --> 02:23:31.560
<v Speaker 3>that keep people from filming factory</v>
<v Speaker 3>farms where they,</v>

3202
02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:34.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pack these chickens and these</v>

3203
02:23:34.201 --> 02:23:37.860
<v Speaker 3>horrible living conditions and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>film it if you film it,</v>

3204
02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:40.560
<v Speaker 3>you can get in deep trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they did a drone video,</v>

3205
02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:43.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pig farm and the pig farm and</v>

3206
02:23:43.441 --> 02:23:46.620
<v Speaker 3>carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Was a motherfucker nasty.</v>

3207
02:23:46.621 --> 02:23:50.740
<v Speaker 3>And they show that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had next to and they interview the</v>

3208
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:54.090
<v Speaker 3>people that are living by their and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just smell it constantly.</v>

3209
02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funk,</v>

3210
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:57.870
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just death and methane.</v>

3211
02:23:58.200 --> 02:23:58.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3212
02:23:58.831 --> 02:24:02.910
<v Speaker 3>that river of piss and shit that comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the bottom of that place and</v>

3213
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:05.150
<v Speaker 3>settles into that little lake that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

3214
02:24:05.151 --> 02:24:07.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's not normal piston shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the worst,</v>

3215
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:12.920
<v Speaker 3>most diseased piss and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's I imagine just living there,</v>

3216
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:15.830
<v Speaker 3>working there rather like someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>works in there,</v>

3217
02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:19.950
<v Speaker 3>like that's the sadness you feel every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day in the smells that you take in</v>

3218
02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:20.640
<v Speaker 3>through your nose.</v>

3219
02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peta was shown a video probably one of</v>

3220
02:24:23.161 --> 02:24:27.150
<v Speaker 3>the worst that I actually had the balls</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch of a how folk was made in</v>

3221
02:24:27.151 --> 02:24:30.030
<v Speaker 3>France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You seeing this just brutal like they</v>

3222
02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:33.390
<v Speaker 3>have people are working there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're tossing in the chicks.</v>

3223
02:24:34.270 --> 02:24:38.400
<v Speaker 3>That's their job to them in the meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>grinder of humans that actually have to</v>

3224
02:24:38.401 --> 02:24:41.100
<v Speaker 3>be a part of that process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ones that they don't,</v>

3225
02:24:41.170 --> 02:24:43.780
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to like was it males or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3226
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:46.350
<v Speaker 3>They get rid of to the female one or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

3227
02:24:46.610 --> 02:24:47.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3228
02:24:47.430 --> 02:24:49.530
<v Speaker 3>the folk want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what's interesting about fog</v>

3229
02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.410
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually gravitate towards that</v>

3230
02:24:52.411 --> 02:24:54.000
<v Speaker 3>feeder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange.</v>

3231
02:24:54.001 --> 02:24:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I had a farmer explained it to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3232
02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:58.080
<v Speaker 3>like they actually want to be fed like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3233
02:24:58.100 --> 02:25:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Go to that feeder and you can grab them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stick it in their mouth and we.</v>

3234
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:04.770
<v Speaker 3>It looks awful when they force feed them</v>
<v Speaker 3>bum up.</v>

3235
02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they forced feeding with and just pour</v>

3236
02:25:06.811 --> 02:25:09.720
<v Speaker 3>it down their throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's not that bad for</v>

3237
02:25:09.721 --> 02:25:13.000
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just perception is as far as like</v>

3238
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 3>were fattening them up for slaughter and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if that was you and they put your</v>

3239
02:25:16.561 --> 02:25:19.380
<v Speaker 3>mouth around this metal pipe and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of life,</v>

3240
02:25:19.450 --> 02:25:21.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but seeing these guys go through the</v>

3241
02:25:21.391 --> 02:25:25.300
<v Speaker 3>meat grinder and some of them don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grinding up of the chicks,</v>

3242
02:25:25.301 --> 02:25:28.510
<v Speaker 3>they get ground up and some come out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other side still alive.</v>

3243
02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>She fog though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do that with a lot of roosters.</v>

3244
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:35.380
<v Speaker 3>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just grind them up.</v>

3245
02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fuck deal.</v>

3246
02:25:36.850 --> 02:25:38.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3247
02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I was on the highway once I pass this</v>
<v Speaker 3>truck and it was stuffed with chickens.</v>

3248
02:25:41.861 --> 02:25:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It was just madness.</v>

3249
02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at this truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

3250
02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:47.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some openings where the</v>

3251
02:25:47.531 --> 02:25:50.870
<v Speaker 3>chickens could breathe like some small</v>
<v Speaker 3>holes in the side of the truck and you</v>

3252
02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:55.890
<v Speaker 3>just realizing this is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing that's packed with life as being</v>

3253
02:25:56.111 --> 02:25:59.800
<v Speaker 3>treated like a commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stacked rocks.</v>

3254
02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

3255
02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:04.910
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre to see a truck just driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>doWn the road.</v>

3256
02:26:04.911 --> 02:26:09.911
<v Speaker 3>It's just stacked bottom to top with</v>
<v Speaker 3>living things that are just going to get</v>

3257
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:15.030
<v Speaker 3>either ground up or chopped up or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3258
02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.710
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going off to death.</v>

3259
02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Well it's what happened when we made</v>
<v Speaker 3>these city things.</v>

3260
02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:23.350
<v Speaker 3>This is also something that didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

3261
02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 3>20,000 years ago when they had any kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of agriculture back then.</v>

3262
02:26:27.281 --> 02:26:29.470
<v Speaker 3>You grew some livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed those animals.</v>

3263
02:26:29.471 --> 02:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>You knew where they lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew what they ate or you knew the</v>

3264
02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:34.930
<v Speaker 3>guy who raised them and it was real</v>
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>

3265
02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:37.480
<v Speaker 3>And then somewhere along the line</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>

3266
02:26:37.481 --> 02:26:42.481
<v Speaker 3>we need like a costco of farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to get a big place and stuff.</v>

3267
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Everything in there and close it to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>general public so nobody could see and</v>

3268
02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.980
<v Speaker 3>jab these fuckers with needles and fill</v>
<v Speaker 3>them up with antibiotics so they don't</v>

3269
02:26:50.981 --> 02:26:53.230
<v Speaker 3>get sick for all this crazy food we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them.</v>

3270
02:26:53.231 --> 02:26:56.110
<v Speaker 3>And boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that changed from that.</v>

3271
02:26:56.350 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 3>People are much more aware now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're asking for free range food and</v>

3272
02:27:00.071 --> 02:27:04.480
<v Speaker 3>antibiotic free food and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass fed meats and things along those</v>

3273
02:27:04.481 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people can't afford it.</v>

3274
02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.030
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people can't afford it is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between,</v>

3275
02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I think I spent a shit ton of money on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3276
02:27:13.091 --> 02:27:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of money goes there.</v>

3277
02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I think knowing where to get your food</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

3278
02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:20.290
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain things you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go like,</v>

3279
02:27:20.291 --> 02:27:20.891
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3280
02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford that.</v>

3281
02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.360
<v Speaker 3>To this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy grass fed filet mignon,</v>

3282
02:27:25.361 --> 02:27:28.540
<v Speaker 3>it's $25 a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can afford grass fed burger,</v>

3283
02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:30.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And free range chicken.</v>

3284
02:27:30.191 --> 02:27:33.310
<v Speaker 3>TheY sell free range chicken free range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organic chicken at costco now,</v>

3285
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.370
<v Speaker 3>so I can get it for three 99 a pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean though?</v>

3286
02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:41.230
<v Speaker 3>When they say free range organic or they</v>
<v Speaker 3>lie down a field they're allowed to go</v>

3287
02:27:41.231 --> 02:27:43.210
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's varying levels of that</v>

3288
02:27:43.211 --> 02:27:44.470
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3289
02:27:44.650 --> 02:27:48.280
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly on a mass scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not going to be the same</v>

3290
02:27:48.281 --> 02:27:51.130
<v Speaker 3>as farmer john down the street who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it all natural.</v>

3291
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Organic is still going to be organic</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed,</v>

3292
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:56.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't do any antibiotics and they</v>

3293
02:27:56.771 --> 02:27:59.980
<v Speaker 3>can't feed them gmo food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what my understanding is.</v>

3294
02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Well what's interesting to me is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having these conversations now</v>

3295
02:28:03.221 --> 02:28:05.830
<v Speaker 3>very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of these documentaries</v>

3296
02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:08.770
<v Speaker 3>where it's food inc or king corn or</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowspiracy.</v>

3297
02:28:08.771 --> 02:28:11.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of these documentaries</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people are examining how food is</v>

3298
02:28:11.681 --> 02:28:15.000
<v Speaker 3>made and prepared and where it's coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from and how they're growing it and,</v>

3299
02:28:15.490 --> 02:28:17.680
<v Speaker 3>and we're more aware of it now than ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3300
02:28:17.681 --> 02:28:19.780
<v Speaker 3>so some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least some people,</v>

3301
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.370
<v Speaker 3>there's a movement to more conscious</v>
<v Speaker 3>choices</v>

3302
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and this wasn't around when our parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>were around,</v>

3303
02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think factory farming was</v>
<v Speaker 1>around when they were around either.</v>

3304
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Was also the difference in the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but when they start talking,</v>

02:30:01.251 --> 02:30:04.820
<v Speaker 1>of because she had announced something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say a part of this little thing that</v>

3341
02:30:04.821 --> 02:30:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they were going to do part of the song.</v>

3342

<v Speaker 1>They're doing a song about a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and speaking french speaking</v>

<v Speaker 1>she has to go up and do this little</v>

3344
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like this little proud moment</v>

3345
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and afterwards she's like beaming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so happy.</v>

3346
02:30:18.081 --> 02:30:21.950

<v Speaker 1>jumps in my arms and gives me this big</v>

3347
02:30:21.951 --> 02:30:24.140
<v Speaker 1>hug.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the feeling that you get of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of warmth and of love and connection</v>

<v Speaker 1>beautiful human boy is like nothing else</v>

<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also recognize,</v>

3351
02:30:32.921 --> 02:30:35.240
<v Speaker 1>and this was one of the big ones for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>

3352
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:40.280
<v Speaker 1>as my chIldren got older and I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it all started of trying at</v>

3353
02:30:40.281 --> 02:30:42.260
<v Speaker 1>least to put the pieces of it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3354
02:30:42.470 --> 02:30:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I started looking at people like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

3355
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:46.671
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3356
02:30:46.671 --> 02:30:51.320
<v Speaker 1>this fucked up dude who's angry at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and just devastated.</v>

3357
02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:54.230
<v Speaker 1>And just emotionally a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a baby.</v>

3358
02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That was a baby that just didn't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>love that he needed or a baby that was</v>

3359
02:30:59.481 --> 02:31:03.410
<v Speaker 1>abused or a baby that was neglected or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby that was rejected,</v>

3360
02:31:03.411 --> 02:31:06.590
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucked up person.</v>

3361
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Now in my mind became a baby like crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3362
02:31:11.091 --> 02:31:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd see a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3363
02:31:12.450 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>on top of a bar with a fucking chop off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ooh,</v>

3364
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a baby that became that.</v>

3365
02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Any asshole guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3366
02:31:22.821 --> 02:31:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking screaming at people at</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic and pointing up,</v>

3367
02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll fuck full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking hills.</v>

3368
02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:31.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a baby that became this asshole.</v>

3369
02:31:31.241 --> 02:31:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this developmental process</v>

3370
02:31:36.151 --> 02:31:39.300
<v Speaker 1>that goes off the rails and into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>

3371
02:31:39.301 --> 02:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to get it back on track is insanely</v>

3372
02:31:43.981 --> 02:31:45.420
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely.</v>

3373
02:31:45.470 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And the work that's required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are not willing to do dmt.</v>

3374
02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3375
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:56.460
<v Speaker 1>to change their diet and to take yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning and to fucking get up</v>

3376
02:31:56.461 --> 02:32:00.120
<v Speaker 1>early and meditate for 20 minutes every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to try to be mindful.</v>

3377
02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Most people are just acting on momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just scrambling.</v>

3378
02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And how can I distract myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I put in front of my face that</v>

3379
02:32:08.141 --> 02:32:10.590
<v Speaker 1>will make me think of something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what I have to deal with.</v>

3380
02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:14.760
<v Speaker 1>That's whY I like talking to people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because I know that you're this on</v>

3381
02:32:14.761 --> 02:32:18.750
<v Speaker 1>this constant search for improvement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant search for growth.</v>

3382
02:32:18.751 --> 02:32:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think that talking to people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and talking to people that are</v>

3383
02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 1>filling themselves with knowledge and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and constantly trying to evaluate their</v>

3384
02:32:26.911 --> 02:32:29.100
<v Speaker 1>perspective and maybe enhance their</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

3385
02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:31.170
<v Speaker 1>that's inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3386
02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3387
02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:33.000
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it aLso,</v>

3388
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.910
<v Speaker 1>it gives fuel to other people that want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the same.</v>

3389
02:32:36.330 --> 02:32:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people will hear this podcast and</v>

02:33:58.411 --> 02:34:01.430
<v Speaker 1>the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3419
02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to you and red band</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about this and mescalin and</v>

3420
02:34:08.161 --> 02:34:09.930
<v Speaker 1>things like that and pod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3421
02:34:09.931 --> 02:34:11.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe with having tried other</v>

3422
02:34:11.851 --> 02:34:13.470
<v Speaker 1>things that you didn't try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3423
02:34:13.471 --> 02:34:15.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of shit I haven't tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

3424
02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:18.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jim fadiman,</v>

3425
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:19.630
<v Speaker 3>who wrote the psychedelic explorer's</v>
<v Speaker 3>guide,</v>

3426
02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:22.360
<v Speaker 3>heard him on ferris's podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God his book read it,</v>

3427
02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:25.870
<v Speaker 3>and then I saw that maps was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>multidisciplinary association of</v>

3428
02:34:25.871 --> 02:34:29.680
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic studies was doing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>presentation in palo alto down the</v>

3429
02:34:29.681 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 3>street from me and rick doblin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head of maps was going to be there</v>

3430
02:34:32.831 --> 02:34:35.700
<v Speaker 3>presenting with jim fadiman like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3431
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:36.850
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go.</v>

3432
02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:41.140
<v Speaker 3>And once you've had a breakthrough</v>
<v Speaker 3>second delegate experience,</v>

3433
02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:43.660
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be life changing or it can fuck</v>

3434
02:34:43.661 --> 02:34:46.210
<v Speaker 3>you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you can take that for what it</v>

3435
02:34:46.211 --> 02:34:48.550
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A large portion of his book was on</v>

3436
02:34:48.551 --> 02:34:52.990
<v Speaker 3>microdosing and in microdosing they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about taking a sub,</v>

3437
02:34:54.850 --> 02:34:57.820
<v Speaker 3>sub perceptual breakthrough level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So meaning like,</v>

3438
02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't see shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel and think differently.</v>

3439
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that's really the future of</v>

3440
02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:07.360
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what hoffman was</v>

3441
02:35:07.361 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 3>doing until he died at 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years old.</v>

3442
02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:11.830
<v Speaker 3>The guy who developed lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3443
02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:14.710
<v Speaker 3>so we went and I listened to these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>

3444
02:35:14.711 --> 02:35:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And since then I have tried microdosing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with lsd and it is phenomenal.</v>

3445
02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like a smart drug in</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

3446
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have energy,</v>

3447
02:35:23.531 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 3>you can see why people might do it at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>festival or a concert.</v>

3448
02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Everything sounds a little more clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a music sounds better.</v>

3449
02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:33.340
<v Speaker 3>If I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see myself running on it like a,</v>

3450
02:35:33.341 --> 02:35:34.630
<v Speaker 3>you really can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

3451
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:36.670
<v Speaker 3>you could still interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can talk to cops on it.</v>

3452
02:35:36.671 --> 02:35:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you were fine to communicate and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

3453
02:35:39.101 --> 02:35:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but you do think differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are connected in a different way.</v>

3454
02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:45.040
<v Speaker 3>That's all the rage in silicone valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3455
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.641
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3456
02:35:45.641 --> 02:35:47.710
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking to you right when I</v>

3457
02:35:47.711 --> 02:35:49.660
<v Speaker 3>was here and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>

3458
02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That down with a mescalin not down with</v>

3459
02:35:52.391 --> 02:35:53.200
<v Speaker 3>the lsd.</v>

3460
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm not down.</v>

3461
02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:57.730
<v Speaker 3>The problem with acid is the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do acid with you.</v>

3462
02:35:57.731 --> 02:35:59.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do acid with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3463
02:35:59.460 --> 02:36:00.011
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3464
02:36:00.011 --> 02:36:03.880
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all these weird people that are</v>

3465
02:36:03.881 --> 02:36:06.460
<v Speaker 3>pushing it and they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dunkin is the only guy that I know</v>

3466
02:36:06.461 --> 02:36:10.420
<v Speaker 3>that gets real acid and we've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>made a loose commitment to me and him</v>

3467
02:36:10.421 --> 02:36:12.790
<v Speaker 3>getting together and doing it one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear about that,</v>

3468
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.633
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3469
02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll definitely talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3470
02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:16.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3471
02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I've been really into</v>

3472
02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:23.880
<v Speaker 3>that I get these big breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm objective moments.</v>

3473
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Introspective moments is edible pot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>psych and um,</v>

3474
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:30.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flotation,</v>

3475
02:36:30.791 --> 02:36:33.400
<v Speaker 3>flotation chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about sensory</v>

3476
02:36:33.401 --> 02:36:38.401
<v Speaker 3>deprivation with the edible pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It creates this bizarre sort of,</v>

3477
02:36:39.791 --> 02:36:42.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenic state,</v>

3478
02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:47.440
<v Speaker 3>visionary state that's very unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unusual from a visionary</v>

3479
02:36:47.441 --> 02:36:48.274
<v Speaker 3>standpoint.</v>

3480
02:36:48.430 --> 02:36:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see obviously you're in pitch</v>

3481
02:36:50.531 --> 02:36:52.480
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anything you see in your mind's eyes</v>

3482
02:36:52.481 --> 02:36:55.780
<v Speaker 3>What you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you say you see like more of the</v>

3483
02:36:55.810 --> 02:36:59.560
<v Speaker 3>sacred geometry or the kaleidoscope of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shapes and things that you do from dmt</v>

3484
02:36:59.561 --> 02:37:04.561
<v Speaker 3>or do you just see like a memory or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>relive something or maybe you see</v>

3485
02:37:04.691 --> 02:37:08.890
<v Speaker 3>something from that's been on your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you live that moment for a second</v>

3486
02:37:08.891 --> 02:37:10.600
<v Speaker 3>and then pull back out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3487
02:37:10.601 --> 02:37:14.020
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the fascinating things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it is the experience is incredibly</v>

3488
02:37:14.021 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 3>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like the experience</v>

3489
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.680
<v Speaker 1>of dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it varies,</v>

3490
02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it's also very dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you do dmt,</v>

3491
02:37:22.430 --> 02:37:23.263
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3492
02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:26.310
<v Speaker 2>aw,</v>

3493
02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.980
<v Speaker 1>reality dissolves and you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the last one that I had was very</v>

3494
02:37:29.981 --> 02:37:32.230
<v Speaker 1>strangely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was these gestures that were</v>

3495
02:37:32.231 --> 02:37:34.420
<v Speaker 1>giving me the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept giving me the finger.</v>

3496
02:37:34.421 --> 02:37:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this about?</v>

3497
02:37:35.890 --> 02:37:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I was trying to figure out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they trying to tell me?</v>

3498
02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell me is,</v>

3499
02:37:40.801 --> 02:37:41.634
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3500
02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like a reaction to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying what other people think of you</v>

3501
02:37:50.201 --> 02:37:53.580
<v Speaker 1>or not worrying about people fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you or not.</v>

3502
02:37:53.770 --> 02:37:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you care?</v>

3503
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:57.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this to youtube,</v>

3504
02:37:57.010 --> 02:37:58.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>

3505
02:37:58.570 --> 02:37:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

3506
02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:03.070
<v Speaker 1>why are you tripping about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I kind of got it in the trip</v>

3507
02:38:03.071 --> 02:38:04.660
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll like shaking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

3508
02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this weird fractal thing</v>

3509
02:38:08.501 --> 02:38:11.830
<v Speaker 1>that's constantly going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time I do it,</v>

3510
02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it seems like these lessons that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped up in these visions with</v>

3511
02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:20.860
<v Speaker 1>communicating entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they are,</v>

3512
02:38:20.861 --> 02:38:22.450
<v Speaker 1>where they're figments of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>

3513
02:38:22.451 --> 02:38:24.640
<v Speaker 1>whether they're real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always lessons in there.</v>

3514
02:38:24.970 --> 02:38:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And these lessons are always pertaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>to either a personal hiccup that I got</v>

3515
02:38:29.891 --> 02:38:34.600
<v Speaker 1>going on or something that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling with or trying to overcome or</v>

3516
02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:38.140
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm constantly focusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and trying to understand better.</v>

3517
02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me help you out there,</v>

3518
02:38:39.761 --> 02:38:41.620
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3519
02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these gestures,</v>

3520
02:38:43.331 --> 02:38:44.240
<v Speaker 1>we're all going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3521
02:38:44.241 --> 02:38:45.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they going to fuck you?</v>

3522
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's almost a,</v>

3523
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:52.000
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inoculation to hostility.</v>

3524
02:38:52.390 --> 02:38:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Like their like letting you like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you even taking this in?</v>

3525
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3526
02:38:56.591 --> 02:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you even concentrating on that?</v>

3527
02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:00.880
<v Speaker 1>This is pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much more.</v>

3528
02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get past that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience in blossoms into some new</v>

3529
02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.030
<v Speaker 1>level of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dmt state is very dmt like.</v>

3530
02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.770
<v Speaker 1>But the cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edible cannabis to the 11 hydroxy</v>

3531
02:39:14.771 --> 02:39:17.200
<v Speaker 1>metabolite state that you get from</v>
<v Speaker 1>edible cannabis,</v>

3532
02:39:17.350 --> 02:39:21.310
<v Speaker 1>which is dose per dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times more psychoactive than thc.</v>

3533
02:39:21.310 --> 02:39:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why people when they eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they trip out and like,</v>

3534
02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:26.800
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many laced it with something.</v>

3535
02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like an intense</v>

3536
02:39:29.561 --> 02:39:33.400
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic when you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you got to be careful and not</v>

3537
02:39:33.401 --> 02:39:35.650
<v Speaker 1>eat too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people that fucking freak out and</v>

3538
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:38.710
<v Speaker 1>panic attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's strong as shit when</v>

3539
02:39:38.711 --> 02:39:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the tank,</v>

3540
02:39:41.230 --> 02:39:44.910
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I go on these Journeys that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3541
02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the forest and I can hear other</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and I understand them and I</v>

3542
02:39:49.691 --> 02:39:54.691
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the fuck they are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm a part of a like a ball of</v>

3543
02:39:54.791 --> 02:39:59.791
<v Speaker 1>yarn that the universe is made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each individual fiber that's in this</v>

3544
02:40:00.761 --> 02:40:05.761
<v Speaker 1>gigantic strand that's a part of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped up ball of yarn is all the</v>

3545
02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:11.430
<v Speaker 1>individual atoms that make up being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person or a tree or a book or a rock and</v>

3546
02:40:13.411 --> 02:40:18.000
<v Speaker 1>all these different things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>intertwined and it shows you the fractal</v>

3547
02:40:18.001 --> 02:40:23.001
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality from the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>subatomic particle to the biggest planet</v>

3548
02:40:23.671 --> 02:40:26.970
<v Speaker 1>in the solar system to the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy in the universe.</v>

3549
02:40:26.970 --> 02:40:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And it just goes out there and this very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange and humbling and bizarre like a</v>

3550
02:40:32.641 --> 02:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>volt vulnerable vulnerability inducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

3551
02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And then it'll go from that to cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking like would to been like neon</v>

3552
02:40:41.191 --> 02:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>cartoons banging each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a bunch of other neon</v>

3553
02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:45.750
<v Speaker 1>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartoons.</v>

3554
02:40:45.751 --> 02:40:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not just cartoons fucking,</v>

3555
02:40:48.061 --> 02:40:51.300
<v Speaker 1>but they're like neon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like made out of like neon</v>

3556
02:40:51.301 --> 02:40:53.760
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're banging each other and</v>

3557
02:40:53.761 --> 02:40:56.490
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're becoming other ones that having</v>

3558
02:40:56.491 --> 02:41:00.360
<v Speaker 1>that god damn thing in my basement is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessing and a curse at the same time</v>

3559
02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:01.800
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3560
02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:03.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a blessing and that it's great that</v>

3561
02:41:03.991 --> 02:41:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I can go in there anytime I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes one crazy trip,</v>

3562
02:41:08.531 --> 02:41:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll just leave me like baffled for</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

3563
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.580
<v Speaker 1>but the relaxation aspect of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometImes I'll go in there on the</v>

3564
02:41:17.850 --> 02:41:21.300
<v Speaker 1>couch and just chill out and just float</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get out of there.</v>

3565
02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'll be in there and while</v>

3566
02:41:23.641 --> 02:41:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm in there floating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like push down to my hips and my back</v>

3567
02:41:26.251 --> 02:41:27.480
<v Speaker 1>would go pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop.</v>

3568
02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's like loosening up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all the,</v>

3569
02:41:31.350 --> 02:41:35.490
<v Speaker 1>all the epsom salts in it has magnesium</v>
<v Speaker 1>and magnesium is great for your body.</v>

3570
02:41:35.491 --> 02:41:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best ways to absorb</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnesium is through the skin.</v>

3571
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.860
<v Speaker 1>That's why an epsom salt bath is so good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your musCles and there's no epsom</v>

3572
02:41:43.861 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 1>salt bath can fuck with the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even close that thousand pounds of</v>

3573
02:41:47.791 --> 02:41:49.950
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No massage can fuck with the tech.</v>

3574
02:41:49.980 --> 02:41:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

3575
02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Amazing massages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you come of the tank,</v>

3576
02:41:53.041 --> 02:41:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you do feel like you're floating four</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours after you just feel high.</v>

3577
02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So you've been in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just haven't been in a tank on</v>

3578
02:41:59.281 --> 02:41:59.580
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3579
02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done anything in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>

3580
02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:05.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's like a smoke a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little sister.</v>

3581
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:08.610
<v Speaker 3>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother have a good now there's</v>

3582
02:42:08.611 --> 02:42:10.620
<v Speaker 3>plaCes available in the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3583
02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:13.590
<v Speaker 3>back in the day there was a lady in los</v>
<v Speaker 3>gatos so it wasn't far from me and she</v>

3584
02:42:13.591 --> 02:42:17.070
<v Speaker 3>sponsored me for fight camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would go in once a week or twice a</v>

3585
02:42:17.071 --> 02:42:19.400
<v Speaker 3>week leading up to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3586
02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was amazing.</v>

3587
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:23.790
<v Speaker 3>It was a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really got me into flotation and</v>

3588
02:42:23.791 --> 02:42:26.910
<v Speaker 3>then she ended up moving down to santa</v>
<v Speaker 3>cruz,</v>

3589
02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:30.630
<v Speaker 3>which is a little hike for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have been an oakland different</v>

3590
02:42:30.631 --> 02:42:33.600
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have them set up now and um,</v>

3591
02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple places that allow the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bin night run,</v>

3592
02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:39.210
<v Speaker 3>so you can go in at midnight and stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>overnight.</v>

3593
02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:43.020
<v Speaker 3>So you do it overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>float all the way until 6:00 AM or 8:00</v>

3594
02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:43.380
<v Speaker 3>AM.</v>

3595
02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's in there with you.</v>

3596
02:42:45.270 --> 02:42:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have someone working there,</v>

3597
02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:47.460
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3598
02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you can go in there and ben just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping it basically so crazy.</v>

3599
02:42:50.401 --> 02:42:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Hippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they know what's up.</v>

3600
02:42:52.261 --> 02:42:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I think they know what time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3601
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:57.840
<v Speaker 3>so it's just a matter of what um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3602
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:59.130
<v Speaker 3>what do I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was like,</v>

3603
02:42:59.131 --> 02:43:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I was curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask you about that.</v>

3604
02:43:00.451 --> 02:43:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3605
02:43:02.130 --> 02:43:03.720
<v Speaker 3>when you say visionary state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you getting from that?</v>

3606
02:43:03.721 --> 02:43:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say like,</v>

3607
02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:06.090
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'm in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

3608
02:43:06.650 --> 02:43:09.180
<v Speaker 3>that's all the answer that I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure going to happen.</v>

3609
02:43:09.270 --> 02:43:13.150
<v Speaker 3>I've done mushrooms in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty intense to how many grams</v>

3610
02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:14.351
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That many.</v>

3611
02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Like three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3612
02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:17.370
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found like,</v>

3613
02:43:17.530 --> 02:43:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not like.</v>

3614
02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3615
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I feel like between a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3616
02:43:23.381 --> 02:43:28.381
<v Speaker 3>one gram to four gram dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a lot of feeling from it,</v>

3617
02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:33.190
<v Speaker 3>but I don't necessarily get to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>visionary state of five grams,</v>

3618
02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:35.470
<v Speaker 3>but do it in silent darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where do you,</v>

3619
02:43:35.471 --> 02:43:36.304
<v Speaker 3>where are you doing it?</v>

3620
02:43:38.370 --> 02:43:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3621
02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:41.560
<v Speaker 3>if I guess it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be different there.</v>

3622
02:43:41.650 --> 02:43:45.340
<v Speaker 3>The visionary state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it occurs with the eyes closed.</v>

3623
02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:48.160
<v Speaker 3>That's where the real visions Come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time when people are doing</v>

3624
02:43:48.161 --> 02:43:50.110
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're out in nature and they were like</v>

3625
02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:53.530
<v Speaker 3>the first time I ever did mushrooms we</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it like in the woods and his</v>

3626
02:43:53.531 --> 02:43:58.090
<v Speaker 3>beautiful manage felt he felt like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrations of the earth as if it was</v>

3627
02:43:58.091 --> 02:44:02.950
<v Speaker 3>like loving you and breathing and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was you felt like connected to</v>

3628
02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:05.470
<v Speaker 3>it in a way that I'd never felt before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was no,</v>

3629
02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:08.380
<v Speaker 3>not much visions because you're out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3630
02:44:08.381 --> 02:44:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seemed like alive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything seemed strange,</v>

3631
02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:14.950
<v Speaker 3>kind of pixelated and everything sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>had like a,</v>

3632
02:44:14.951 --> 02:44:19.180
<v Speaker 3>like a geometric pattern to it in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird way that you never experienced.</v>

3633
02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Tasha and I did have had him at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beach and we had a monster dose one time</v>

3634
02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:28.681
<v Speaker 3>after iowasca is really kind of improved</v>
<v Speaker 3>other psychedelic experiences for both</v>

3635
02:44:29.771 --> 02:44:31.090
<v Speaker 3>of us because we can let go.</v>

3636
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some of those lessons of not trying</v>

3637
02:44:33.281 --> 02:44:34.210
<v Speaker 3>to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3638
02:44:34.211 --> 02:44:36.580
<v Speaker 3>just going with the flow and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

3639
02:44:37.470 --> 02:44:41.050
<v Speaker 3>and then also from a stomach standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people that eat mushrooms,</v>

3640
02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:43.750
<v Speaker 3>it fucks her stomach up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to fuck my stomach up,</v>

3641
02:44:43.751 --> 02:44:47.560
<v Speaker 3>but after you've purchased from iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's nothing for me to have a bunch</v>

3642
02:44:47.561 --> 02:44:49.720
<v Speaker 3>of mushrooms and my stomach's never did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me,</v>

3643
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:52.300
<v Speaker 3>to my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why this is really is.</v>

3644
02:44:52.301 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very personal deal.</v>

3645
02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:57.310
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had seven grams each on the beach and</v>

3646
02:44:57.311 --> 02:45:01.270
<v Speaker 3>that's the most we've ever taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went when I was face up,</v>

3647
02:45:01.930 --> 02:45:04.600
<v Speaker 3>she's 110 pounds too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's the real trooper.</v>

3648
02:45:04.601 --> 02:45:08.320
<v Speaker 3>But when I was face up you could see</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I wouldn't normally see</v>

3649
02:45:08.321 --> 02:45:08.831
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3650
02:45:08.831 --> 02:45:11.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seagulls in a v formation I could see</v>

3651
02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:13.540
<v Speaker 3>like laser beams connecting their wings.</v>

3652
02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:17.470
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would from a dmt trip.</v>

3653
02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:21.340
<v Speaker 3>but every color of the light spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 3>was connecting their wings as they</v>

3654
02:45:21.341 --> 02:45:25.420
<v Speaker 3>flowed through air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the sound of the ocean is</v>

3655
02:45:25.421 --> 02:45:28.050
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when I went face down and bears</v>

3656
02:45:28.090 --> 02:45:31.650
<v Speaker 3>buried my face in the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I had complete visionary state just</v>

3657
02:45:31.651 --> 02:45:34.780
<v Speaker 3>like dmt or or iowasca even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3658
02:45:34.781 --> 02:45:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And probably last a long ass time to</v>

3659
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:41.680
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a long day at the beach.</v>

3660
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.180
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a couple solid hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>visions then,</v>

3661
02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:47.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that kind of dose.</v>

3662
02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On and off.</v>

3663
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:49.980
<v Speaker 3>There were some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3664
02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:52.180
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept seeing that initially I kept</v>

3665
02:45:52.181 --> 02:45:55.990
<v Speaker 3>seeing like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a group of people like kind of</v>

3666
02:45:55.991 --> 02:45:59.170
<v Speaker 3>eyeball on us that I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they going to take our shit?</v>

3667
02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Like are they going to try to steal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to have to fight someone?</v>

3668
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Like this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a place not a lot of people go</v>

3669
02:46:04.361 --> 02:46:06.790
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I kept seeing that and then I had to</v>

3670
02:46:06.791 --> 02:46:11.000
<v Speaker 3>take a deep breath</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tosca You like feel me,</v>

3672
02:46:12.421 --> 02:46:13.520
<v Speaker 3>She could feel what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3675
02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:20.600
<v Speaker 3>She's like playing fucking sea turtle</v>
<v Speaker 3>bugs.</v>

3676
02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:21.081
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

3677
02:46:21.081 --> 02:46:22.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she just doesn't have it,</v>

3678
02:46:22.941 --> 02:46:25.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's looking over at me and am I</v>

3679
02:46:25.381 --> 02:46:26.240
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>

3682
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:29.623
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3683
02:46:29.950 --> 02:46:32.190
<v Speaker 3>And I put my head back down and it kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing.</v>

3684
02:46:32.191 --> 02:46:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Didn't like this young kid kind of comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the crowd,</v>

3685
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 3>like he's going to challenge me and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>walks down like,</v>

3686
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:39.410
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a defender.</v>

3687
02:46:39.430 --> 02:46:41.210
<v Speaker 3>So I got to fight and I know how fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up I am.</v>

3688
02:46:41.210 --> 02:46:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't believe we had to defend</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

3689
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:45.980
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's playing out in my mind all the ways</v>

3690
02:46:45.981 --> 02:46:47.360
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to have to fight this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

3691
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:49.990
<v Speaker 3>And I realized right then like I stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>up open.</v>

3692
02:46:49.991 --> 02:46:50.751
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

3693
02:46:50.751 --> 02:46:51.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3694
02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.020
<v Speaker 3>my heart's raciNg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3695
02:46:54.021 --> 02:46:57.560
<v Speaker 3>why would I think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized every fucking day of</v>

3696
02:46:57.561 --> 02:47:00.890
<v Speaker 3>my life since I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played that out.</v>

3697
02:47:01.970 --> 02:47:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says like we're from whatever being</v>

3698
02:47:06.711 --> 02:47:08.390
<v Speaker 3>picked on as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullied that kind of shit.</v>

3699
02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I always play that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how am I going to have to fight</v>

3700
02:47:11.121 --> 02:47:13.520
<v Speaker 3>this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to have to fucking defend</v>

3701
02:47:13.521 --> 02:47:15.350
<v Speaker 3>myself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it going to play out?</v>

3702
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a long fucking neck,</v>

3703
02:47:18.171 --> 02:47:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take us back and choke them</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

3704
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:20.601
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3705
02:47:20.601 --> 02:47:20.870
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying?</v>

3706
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:23.140
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just showed me how silly this</v>

3707
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:27.140
<v Speaker 3>dumb ass mind game that I would play and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go down the rabbit hole on a</v>

3708
02:47:27.141 --> 02:47:28.930
<v Speaker 3>fucking daily basis sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3709
02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:33.740
<v Speaker 3>like just playing into this thought of</v>
<v Speaker 3>negativity that had no space for me and</v>

3710
02:47:33.741 --> 02:47:35.330
<v Speaker 3>it does me no good to play that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3711
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 3>that's fine because then I'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3712
02:47:37.731 --> 02:47:38.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3713
02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:41.150
<v Speaker 3>none of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wasting time and becoming</v>

3714
02:47:41.151 --> 02:47:44.150
<v Speaker 3>emotionally attached to those thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just,</v>

3715
02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:45.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about this.</v>

3716
02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:48.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling like I'm going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3717
02:47:48.470 --> 02:47:51.440
<v Speaker 3>That fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That turns you into not your best</v>

3718
02:47:51.441 --> 02:47:54.940
<v Speaker 3>version of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that vision from mushrooms was just a</v>

3719
02:47:54.970 --> 02:47:58.610
<v Speaker 3>fucking game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop me from having those</v>

3720
02:47:58.611 --> 02:48:01.550
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it allows me to catch myself.</v>

3721
02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the pattern still exists,</v>

3722
02:48:04.101 --> 02:48:05.100
<v Speaker 3>you just don't entertain it.</v>

3723
02:48:05.250 --> 02:48:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't entertain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see it and let it go.</v>

3724
02:48:07.281 --> 02:48:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Like when they talk about meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3725
02:48:08.470 --> 02:48:10.550
<v Speaker 3>if you have a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just recognize the thought and let it</v>

3726
02:48:10.551 --> 02:48:12.170
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easier said than done.</v>

3727
02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Now I've had time to digest and</v>
<v Speaker 3>assimilate that and especially bouncing</v>

3728
02:48:17.091 --> 02:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>or bartender and the guy's being a dick</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

3729
02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:21.170
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much easier for me to be like,</v>

3730
02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to entertain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy swings at me.</v>

3731
02:48:23.271 --> 02:48:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Then it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's worried about you're not going to</v>

3732
02:48:25.851 --> 02:48:29.460
<v Speaker 3>not know when it's getting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no need sometimes.</v>

3733
02:48:29.470 --> 02:48:31.700
<v Speaker 3>The things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say that about cops,</v>

3734
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:36.650
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes I bet certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the people that deal with</v>

3735
02:48:36.651 --> 02:48:38.690
<v Speaker 3>the cops or certain people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops,</v>

3736
02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:44.080
<v Speaker 3>things happen that don't need to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people have these ideas or have</v>

3737
02:48:44.391 --> 02:48:47.990
<v Speaker 3>these patterns that are playing on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their head and for a comp I would</v>

3738
02:48:47.991 --> 02:48:50.960
<v Speaker 3>imagine it's got to be incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult because you're dealing with</v>

3739
02:48:50.961 --> 02:48:55.180
<v Speaker 3>all these people that are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking laws and violating things and</v>

3740
02:48:55.181 --> 02:48:57.770
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to enforce them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly worried about getting</v>

3741
02:48:57.771 --> 02:49:00.710
<v Speaker 3>shot and getting home to your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly worried about pulling</v>

3742
02:49:00.711 --> 02:49:03.230
<v Speaker 3>some guy over and he's got fucking 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds of coke in the back of the</v>

3743
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:06.020
<v Speaker 3>machine gun in his front seat and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know because there's windows are</v>

3744
02:49:06.021 --> 02:49:08.130
<v Speaker 3>tinted elixir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roll down your window</v>

3745
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:09.330
<v Speaker 1>and you get your hand on your gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3746
02:49:09.331 --> 02:49:12.900
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I getting into here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then these patterns that people</v>

3747
02:49:12.901 --> 02:49:15.210
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's as a police officer,</v>

3748
02:49:15.211 --> 02:49:19.590
<v Speaker 1>as a person getting pulled over by cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can change the way you interact</v>

3749
02:49:19.591 --> 02:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>with people and change the circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and and turned a tragedy into</v>

3750
02:49:24.211 --> 02:49:27.570
<v Speaker 1>a nothing or nothing into a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the lens.</v>

3751
02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the filter you see through all</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interactions come out of that</v>

3752
02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:32.460
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3753
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:36.810
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the beautiful thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics is that it allows you to</v>

3754
02:49:36.811 --> 02:49:40.110
<v Speaker 1>get outside of you and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculousness of you.</v>

3755

<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about change and</v>

3757
02:49:45.031 --> 02:49:50.010
<v Speaker 1>transformation and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been my biggest catalyst and</v>

3758
02:49:50.011 --> 02:49:52.450
<v Speaker 1>seeing the way I behave and that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that I'm mr.</v>

3759
02:49:52.530 --> 02:49:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I don't get angry or I'm not a</v>

3760
02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:55.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3762
02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:59.970
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've touched it.</v>

3763
02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I've had though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

3764
02:50:01.230 --> 02:50:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's had a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3765
02:50:02.541 --> 02:50:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's fucking a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

3766
02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:06.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no perfect people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3767
02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:09.960
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's this idea that there's a perfect</v>

3768
02:50:09.961 --> 02:50:11.820
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an enlightened being.</v>

3769
02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:17.240
<v Speaker 1>There are people that choose to go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain paths that will lead to them</v>

3770
02:50:18.421 --> 02:50:22.110
<v Speaker 1>making better decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to them living a more harmonious</v>

3771
02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:24.270
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're just a monkey.</v>

3772
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You just some fucking talking ape that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this planet filled with</v>

3773
02:50:28.861 --> 02:50:32.820
<v Speaker 1>contradictions and chaos and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get through like all of us are</v>

3774
02:50:33.090 --> 02:50:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and who's going to be interrelationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama in work,</v>

3775
02:50:36.871 --> 02:50:40.470
<v Speaker 1>drama on and fucking community drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood drama,</v>

3776
02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:43.890
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll be too stressed out or</v>

3777
02:50:43.891 --> 02:50:48.080
<v Speaker 1>too tired or too distracted or two too</v>
<v Speaker 1>overworked or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3778
02:50:48.081 --> 02:50:49.590
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a bad reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

3779
02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:52.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't define you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem that people have</v>

3780
02:50:52.711 --> 02:50:54.570
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one bad reaction.</v>

3781
02:50:54.571 --> 02:50:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you yell at your neighbor and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you and these things that have.</v>

3784
02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy of mine last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained to me something that he got</v>

3785
02:51:03.151 --> 02:51:07.620
<v Speaker 1>into his with his neighbor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he accuses neighbor of slashing his tire</v>

3786
02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:10.190
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucking know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yelled at his neighbor.</v>

3788
02:51:11.250 --> 02:51:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And then he got his car picked up by</v>
<v Speaker 1>aaa,</v>

3789
02:51:14.970 --> 02:51:15.890
<v Speaker 1>they changed the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

3790
02:51:15.891 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit a curb,</v>

3791
02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.890
<v Speaker 1>curb and deflated his tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was blaming his neighbor,</v>

3792
02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:24.690
<v Speaker 1>pull the spear out of your mouth right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3793
02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:26.790

<v Speaker 1>And he was like.</v>

3794
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a comic.</v>

3795
02:51:28.201 --> 02:51:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to talk about this on</v>

3796
02:51:29.281 --> 02:51:29.550
<v Speaker 1>stage?</v>

3797
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:30.331
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

3798
02:51:30.331 --> 02:51:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm too embarrassed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready to like,</v>

3799
02:51:33.150 --> 02:51:34.210
<v Speaker 1>this isn't funny to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3800
02:51:34.211 --> 02:51:35.670
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling me because we're friends,</v>

3801
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:37.110
<v Speaker 1>we're both laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3802
02:51:37.111 --> 02:51:39.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you apologize to emulate?</v>

3803
02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT was like,</v>

3804
02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:42.150
<v Speaker 1>god damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

3805
02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Like because his neighbor would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed because he parked in front of his</v>

3806
02:51:45.330 --> 02:51:48.420
<v Speaker 1>house and the guy had trash cans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3807
02:51:48.421 --> 02:51:50.920
<v Speaker 1>you park it too close to my trash cans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get my trash cans.</v>

3808
02:51:50.921 --> 02:51:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3809
02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:55.020
<v Speaker 1>And so he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds this note on his car and his</v>

3810
02:51:55.021 --> 02:51:57.600
<v Speaker 1>tires flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he assumed that the guy wrote the</v>

3811
02:51:57.601 --> 02:52:00.560
<v Speaker 1>note tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3812
02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:03.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he fucked up,</v>

3813
02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fuck ups,</v>

3814
02:52:05.410 --> 02:52:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but if you took those fuck ups and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3815
02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:10.000
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you concentrate on your whole life all</v>

3816
02:52:10.001 --> 02:52:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the times you fucked up.</v>

3817
02:52:11.050 --> 02:52:11.861
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3818
02:52:11.861 --> 02:52:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

3819
02:52:13.481 --> 02:52:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you just a person man did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit will repeat itself.</v>

3820
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you will fall into the path of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having the humility or at</v>

3821
02:52:20.741 --> 02:52:24.700
<v Speaker 1>least getting a little help from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside source that allows you to take a</v>

3822
02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>step back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull the blinders off and see what's</v>

3823
02:52:26.921 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 1>going on and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>

3824
02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also whY objectivity is so</v>

3825
02:52:31.421 --> 02:52:35.890
<v Speaker 1>important and introspective thought is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so important because sometimes people</v>

3826
02:52:35.891 --> 02:52:38.200
<v Speaker 1>just make excuses for everything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3827
02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a fucking excuse for.</v>

3828
02:52:40.601 --> 02:52:43.210
<v Speaker 1>So you never get the lessons and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>never get the growth.</v>

3829
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:45.100
<v Speaker 1>He never learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

3830
02:52:45.101 --> 02:52:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you just constantly repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly repeat.</v>

3831
02:52:48.551 --> 02:52:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And then one day you're a Bitter old man</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling at these kids to stop what</v>

3832
02:52:53.271 --> 02:52:56.920
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking rock and roll music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goddamn car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Driving down my street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got loud muffler and that's the same</v>

3834
02:53:00.791 --> 02:53:03.140
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows his patterns stayed.</v>

3835
02:53:03.150 --> 02:53:04.960
<v Speaker 1>They fall into these patterns and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

3836
02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And these never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never corrected enough.</v>

3837
02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Never got it right.</v>

3839
02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:12.700
<v Speaker 1>No introspection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no quiet time.</v>
