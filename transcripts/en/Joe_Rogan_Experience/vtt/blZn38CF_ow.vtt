<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine what that must've </v>

84
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

85
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you're there and all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer,</v>

86
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>he grabbed her about the waste and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started smashing her back and forth.</v>

87
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Just ragdoll here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had enough.</v>

88
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

89
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>That's it motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>it's really incredible that we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool to do that.</v>

91
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And then we go and watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>it's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoos bums me the fuck out.</v>

93
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.330
<v Speaker 1>We went to a zoo in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia while we were there and there </v>

94
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.991
<v Speaker 1>was a cool part of it was the crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage because I don't think that </v>

95
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>crocodile gives a fuck where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think crocodiles are so dumb.</v>

96
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean they seem third mind seemed so </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

97
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.780
<v Speaker 1>They just lay there with their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed underwater for like hours at a </v>

98
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>time where they don't have to breathe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can brief for like an hour.</v>

99
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>So they just lay underwater and just do </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing and just sit there.</v>

100
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't run around and play like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pass like the monkey cage at a zoo,</v>

101
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that shit's depressing because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be there.</v>

102
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a zoo in Denver and uh,</v>

103
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>the monkey gun in his fucking cage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was howling this horrible howl and it </v>

104
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:36.901
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a big cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This monkey was screaming out like a </v>

105
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>tortured soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a man in prison,</v>

106
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me out of the monkey was just </v>

107
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>screaming at the top of his lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

108
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 1>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not cool to do them for </v>

109
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people can stare at them.</v>

110
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've flown in the 19 thirties,</v>

111
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when there was no zoos are back,</v>

112
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have videos now,</v>

113
00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to put them in a zoo,</v>

114
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

115
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.030
<v Speaker 2>but that's the only time we would ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to see most of those animals.</v>

116
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that makes me go </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

117
00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:12.741
<v Speaker 2>I see the reason for zoom because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to Africa and hunting down a </v>

118
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:12.741
<v Speaker 2>white tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

119
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

120
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Worth it for them to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you could stare at them.</v>

121
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

122
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 2>it could also be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

123
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to hunt my food.</v>

124
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 2>There's just a stake here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every morning when I wake up,</v>

125
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I could sleep.</v>

126
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

127
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For like tigers.</v>

128
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>That shit is orgasmic to chase down an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

129
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.570
<v Speaker 1>chase it and move it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see a cap?</v>

130
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like if you roll a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a string in front of them,</v>

131
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

132
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you should know that you have cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats can't help it.</v>

133
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Speaker 1>They live for chasing shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like,</v>

134
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:48.621
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy with a hard dick lives to fuck </v>

135
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:48.621
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the same thing,</v>

136
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it's nature rewards them for being</v>

137
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>a good Predator and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the same way food tastes good for us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex feels good for us.</v>

139
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>They love to kill that nature that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewards them with some crazy rush of </v>

140
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.130
<v Speaker 1>energy and an endorphins when they kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

141
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you give them a cold plate of meat </v>

142
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>just pushing aluminum tray under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cage.</v>

143
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not fun.</v>

144
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.370
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't that the killing thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothers me.</v>

146
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>But what really bothers me is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking amount of room that they have to</v>

147
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:29.421
<v Speaker 1>move around the kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kangaroo cage was fucked up.</v>

148
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever read the San Diego Zoo </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

149
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

150
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

151
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:40.011
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to be an animal in this </v>

152
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:40.011
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

153
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went down this serious fucking </v>

154
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>deliver between what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're saying was that it.</v>

155
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

157
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.590
<v Speaker 1>San Diego is the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they have it as nice.</v>

158
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.320
<v Speaker 1>They have a big giant ass place that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

159
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's fucking expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

160
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.630
<v Speaker 2>But that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They places like the La Zoo just </v>

161
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't exist because that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

162
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 2>You go to the Lsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just depressing as fuck,</v>

163
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but there is just like the Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 2>state where I'm from.</v>

164
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the biggest news Jack </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hanna's from it and it's nice.</v>

165
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 2>They may have just acres and acres and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acres of land and they,</v>

166
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they maybe throw out </v>

167
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Speaker 1>some goats once in a while for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tigers or something.</v>

168
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.540
<v Speaker 1>It just don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

169
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever do that.</v>

170
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.530
<v Speaker 1>They do that in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's video in Iraq,</v>

171
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:27.580
<v Speaker 1>have a little donkey loose and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they do it every day.</v>

172
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because just walking around eating and </v>

173
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.741
<v Speaker 1>they open up the gate and these tigers </v>
<v Speaker 1>come running out of the gate and just </v>

174
00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 1>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slept at docie to the ground and fucking</v>

175
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of wild to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really shocking.</v>

177
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 1>These gis filmed it when they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq at the zoo.</v>

178
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shocking to see.</v>

179
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's really the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to eat.</v>

180
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Like though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you should do it.</v>

181
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to feed animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have wild animals.</v>

182
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You should have them eat what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally eat,</v>

183
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

184
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>what's with this feeding fucking snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frozen mice.</v>

185
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Give them a fucking mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

186
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're supposed to do.</v>

187
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to like,</v>

188
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>enforce our own ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

189
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>of morality and predation on fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>

190
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

191
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>like a snake is a monster dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a monster.</v>

193
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Those are all monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

194
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their national monsters.</v>

195
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole natural cycle of things.</v>

196
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And to take them out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

197
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:26.691
<v Speaker 1>there was a kangaroo cage that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most depressing thing because those </v>

198
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>kangaroos are just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't</v>

199
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.000
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's human beings.</v>

200
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.940
<v Speaker 2>There could be considered monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're,</v>

201
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>if you put somebody in prison that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass murder,</v>

202
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 2>we're doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

203
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should let that mass murder go out on</v>

204
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 2>his way and just murder a shitload of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

205
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb ass logic as well.</v>

206
00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're saying like,</v>

207
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a tiger that tiger or whatever,</v>

208
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>like a snake should kill its own prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we should,</v>

209
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what,</v>

210
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

211
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding them killed.</v>

212
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Pray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kill it first.</v>

213
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the most ridiculous thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we kill what they,</v>

214
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>they eat first so that it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal for us.</v>

215
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else kills it.</v>

216
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:03.430
<v Speaker 1>You buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

217
00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 1>then you feed it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

218
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a mass murderer,</v>

219
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass murderers or just fucked in the </v>

220
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

221
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not killing for food is a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a natural cycle.</v>

222
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.810
<v Speaker 1>They're just nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

223
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Then when you get a naughty person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is human consciousness is so</v>

224
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:22.321
<v Speaker 1>more complex supposedly than animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness because we have the </v>

225
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.711
<v Speaker 1>ability to alter our environment so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't have someone whose consciousness </v>

226
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>is haywire because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what when you have like serial </v>

227
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.320
<v Speaker 1>killers or mass murderers will you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone whose consciousness is just gone</v>

228
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:37.321
<v Speaker 1>off the tracks and into the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have just chaos and if a society is </v>

229
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:43.381
<v Speaker 1>aware of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to realize that there's certain </v>

230
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:44.080
<v Speaker 1>issues are going to come up when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have crazy people running around killing</v>

231
00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:46.570
<v Speaker 1>your family and your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to kill them.</v>

232
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.180
<v Speaker 1>What you're supposed to do with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mass murder of.</v>

233
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

234
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the court system,</v>

235
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 1>the court system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking corrupt and so many times das</v>

236
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>and prosecutors are just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

237
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>they're just kind of trying to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty verdict and they don't give a </v>

238
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.510
<v Speaker 1>fuck if someone is guilty or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's many,</v>

239
00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:09.511
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many instances where cops have framed </v>

240
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:09.880
<v Speaker 1>guys that were innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have gone to jail for years.</v>

241
00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It turns out the DNA evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were framed.</v>

242
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's happened many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

243
00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 1>many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real fucking problem.</v>

244
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 1>But if we could be absolutely sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew that somebody was a mass </v>

245
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 1>murderer or a rapist or anyone with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>remorse,</v>

246
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:24.580
<v Speaker 1>who hurt other people and could hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that you care,</v>

247
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

248
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Why keep them around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many fucking people,</v>

249
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:34.101
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're not going to die </v>

251
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:34.101
<v Speaker 1>eventually anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if you don't tell them,</v>

252
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna fucking to cure cancer and</v>

253
00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:35.770
<v Speaker 1>live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

254
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a mass murderer is not going</v>

255
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:40.060
<v Speaker 1>to contribute to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:11:40.061 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not.</v>

257
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.090
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing good is going to come out of </v>

258
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

259
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It should just line them up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

260
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you need a new liver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

261
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You're on death row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>

262
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 2>There should be no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

263
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time period and they're going to </v>

264
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.370
<v Speaker 2>electrocute you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should just shoot.</v>

265
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.921
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take all the parts that they could use </v>

266
00:11:58.921 --> 00:11:58.921
<v Speaker 2>your corneas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are your livers best?</v>

267
00:11:58.921 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>An interesting topic because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat on the board and the message </v>

268
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.851
<v Speaker 1>board on my website where people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Oregon's having a memory </v>

269
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all these people who have </v>

270
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 1>gotten transplants when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they knew things that </v>

271
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have possibly known as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't even know,</v>

272
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>

273
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

274
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of many things like that </v>

275
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.211
<v Speaker 1>where people sudden had cravings for </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain types of foods and they had no </v>

276
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:25.211
<v Speaker 1>idea that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

277
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.160
<v Speaker 1>this is not just one instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And see the thing is about memory.</v>

278
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't know where memory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored.</v>

279
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>

280
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know an incredible amount more than</v>

281
00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:39.911
<v Speaker 1>the average person about the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human body works much more than people </v>

282
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 1>knew 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more than you know,</v>

283
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.750
<v Speaker 1>even a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know everything.</v>

284
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

285
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.350
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when human body,</v>

286
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.930
<v Speaker 1>your cells regenerate every seven to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

287
00:12:50.931 --> 00:12:55.931
<v Speaker 1>I think it's seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so literally every cell in your body </v>

288
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:57.960
<v Speaker 1>changes and becomes a new one like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

289
00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You're a new version of you every seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 10 years.</v>

290
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not the same anymore.</v>

291
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck are your memories?</v>

292
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Because I have memories that are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than seven years old,</v>

293
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where the memory is stored,</v>

294
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:15.260
<v Speaker 1>if you have a completely new cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean are the memories like transferred</v>

295
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.990
<v Speaker 1>back and forth between the cells when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new one is born?</v>

296
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it born with the same memories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

297
00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:21.320
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the memory?</v>

298
00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Where's it stored?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't fucking know.</v>

299
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.360
<v Speaker 1>The other idea is that the memories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored in the neurons.</v>

300
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

301
00:13:27.471 --> 00:13:30.530
<v Speaker 1>because the neurons are the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stay the neurons or not.</v>

302
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.890
<v Speaker 1>You get the neurons you get or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons you get forever.</v>

303
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't get new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

304
00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 1>they don't regenerate every seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the heart is filled with neurons.</v>

305
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the biggest clusters of</v>

306
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:44.210
<v Speaker 1>neurons in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like right up there with the brain.</v>

307
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think people who have had heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>transplants,</v>

308
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would have memories.</v>

309
00:13:50.391 --> 00:13:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that preposterous at all?</v>

310
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that these people that </v>

311
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.591
<v Speaker 2>say that they're having dreams stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably would have had that same </v>

312
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:00.591
<v Speaker 2>exact dream with or without it.</v>

313
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Why would you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

314
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:05.851
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't possibly have known about </v>

315
00:14:05.851 --> 00:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>people have this little girl gave up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact identity and location of the </v>

316
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who of the man who murdered the girl who</v>

317
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 1>gave her the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that story?</v>

318
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it started there.</v>

319
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It sounds far fetched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean it's not good.</v>

320
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 2>There's some things that I read that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it like that,</v>

321
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 2>that it's kind of like to me is seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for.</v>

322
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.500
<v Speaker 2>It's either somebody that wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

323
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.080
<v Speaker 2>that's just dumb and they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

324
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I had my arm transplant and now I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking having all these dreams are</v>

325
00:14:34.111 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

326
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.400
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

327
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

328
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.170
<v Speaker 2>It's also possible that toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

329
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What skepticism.</v>

330
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.370
<v Speaker 2>This isn't</v>

331
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.930
<v Speaker 1>my comes to something that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

332
00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:49.931
<v Speaker 1>That's the problems that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run the possibility of a excluding </v>

333
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:54.911
<v Speaker 1>something because it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is we don't have enough </v>

334
00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>information to decide what's rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's irrational.</v>

335
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea that you have memories at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

336
00:14:58.251 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

337
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the idea that you can change </v>

338
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:04.950
<v Speaker 1>people's memories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

339
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>they say that especially like right </v>
<v Speaker 1>after something shocking.</v>

340
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>If you start talking to someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing new ideas to them,</v>

341
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have,</v>

342
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>they'll remember the whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll change the whole way.</v>

343
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:21.941
<v Speaker 1>They remember things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought of something was </v>

344
00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:25.211
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go back and you watch the </v>

345
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:25.211
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

346
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:25.211
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that at all.</v>

347
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust my memory that much.</v>

348
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I trust some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some things that I know are </v>

349
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>recording in there forever for real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

350
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>There's some things because I've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that have kept that memory.</v>

351
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had some pretty intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences where I made sure like I am </v>

352
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>going to make sure that I record this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

353
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 1>but other ones are like fucking blur </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

354
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:49.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them that are blurring,</v>

355
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look back on your,</v>

356
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>your high school years like Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

357
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like a slideshows and I barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember any of it.</v>

358
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's getting worse and worse.</v>

359
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:04.481
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually pretty good with a lot of </v>

360
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:04.481
<v Speaker 1>weird memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I,</v>

361
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:08.500
<v Speaker 1>the other day I was trying to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and that I actually hung out </v>

362
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>with for three years when I was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't remember his face at all.</v>

363
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Came up with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sister's like,</v>

364
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We out all the time.</v>

365
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember him but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have any idea what he looks like.</v>

366
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had that happen to me before for </v>

367
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:22.950
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking weird.</v>

368
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

369
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I wonder where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where all that shit goes.</v>

370
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Bin Smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that someone can pull it back </v>

371
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.870
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will say something that you</v>

372
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

373
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

374
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The memory like blossoms in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

375
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're given CPR to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>

376
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're almost dead.</v>

377
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a branch of the tree was hit </v>

378
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and nerve of that memory was hit and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>woke up that,</v>

379
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 2>that section of memory or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Something along those lines with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

381
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.380
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody's phone.</v>

382
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.340
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>

383
00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:00.930
<v Speaker 2>you had a spider on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

384
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a daddy long legs.</v>

385
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:10.350
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did that get on your house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear factor.</v>

386
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to be at the Addison </v>

392
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

393
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 1>this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and Sunday with my man Joey Diaz and </v>

395
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Brian will be there as well if we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian drunk who might have to talk them </v>

396
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:47.730
<v Speaker 1>into going on stage</v>

397
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.090
<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian</v>

398
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>is actually funny comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done standup a couple of times.</v>

399
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.260
<v Speaker 1>He did it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it.</v>

401
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else would you do it,</v>

402
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to try to go up on stage </v>

403
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.951
<v Speaker 2>before this weekend just in case if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I get too drunk and he put me on </v>

404
00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:05.951
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really,</v>

405
00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:10.691
<v Speaker 2>it really hurts me to go back and spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours of my life for like five </v>

406
00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:12.650
<v Speaker 2>minutes in front of two people.</v>

407
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.660
<v Speaker 1>The open mic nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a grind,</v>

408
00:18:16.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask me questions all the time </v>

409
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

410
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the best advice?</v>

411
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

412
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be willing to put your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life aside.</v>

413
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be willing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be willing to.</v>

414
00:18:26.561 --> 00:18:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you have a job during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

415
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you have a job on the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

416
00:18:29.861 --> 00:18:31.690
<v Speaker 1>your nighttime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now,</v>

417
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.210
<v Speaker 1>that's your social life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be standup comedy,</v>

418
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be going to clubs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be performing and you </v>

419
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.730
<v Speaker 1>have to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do it all the time,</v>

420
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you're going to forget all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

421
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.000
<v Speaker 1>The whatever comfort you gain on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be eroded very quickly.</v>

422
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a God damn long ask Ryan,</v>

423
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:49.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

424
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I was younger I would tell </v>

425
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.401
<v Speaker 2>libby and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really hard to be an adult and </v>

426
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:56.401
<v Speaker 2>waste that much time.</v>

427
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:56.401
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hard.</v>

428
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

429
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I started doing standup when I was a 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I did it right after my 21st </v>

430
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:06.320
<v Speaker 1>birthday and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had shit going on back then,</v>

431
00:19:06.321 --> 00:19:06.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

432
00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing things.</v>

433
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I had a life sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like I had a family or a </v>

435
00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:17.240
<v Speaker 1>mortgage or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no obligations,</v>

437
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.740
<v Speaker 1>no Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no obligations.</v>

438
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't,</v>

439
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.210
<v Speaker 1>it's hard when you have a girlfriend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a life and you have a life and </v>

440
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you have children and a mortgage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

441
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to dudes that are like 40 </v>

442
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and they're thinking about doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

443
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

444
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.840
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into brain surgery.</v>

445
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.890
<v Speaker 1>When we think about brand surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying that comedy is as hard as </v>

446
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.990
<v Speaker 1>brain surgery because it's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as.</v>

447
00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not as difficult to remember all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you need to remember with </v>

448
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 1>brain surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

449
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.640
<v Speaker 1>it is just as difficult in a way because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no real path.</v>

450
00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could suck as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't suck as a brain surgeon.</v>

451
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's obviously a lot more discipline </v>

452
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>involved in brain surgery because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do it correctly,</v>

453
00:20:04.941 --> 00:20:09.941
<v Speaker 1>but both are equally difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually fucking do and put anything in </v>

454
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:14.630
<v Speaker 1>this life is difficult if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna really do it.</v>

455
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about if you started tomorrow</v>

456
00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and you wanted to be a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmer,</v>

457
00:20:19.461 --> 00:20:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit about computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

458
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.890
<v Speaker 1>you're starting from scratch and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a computer programmer.</v>

459
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the fucking work that's involved</v>

460
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

461
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>A lot of reading now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of reading nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean you can pretty much teach </v>

463

00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a computer programmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see code for video games.</v>

471

<v Speaker 1>Good fucking luck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about I want to create video game </v>

476
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking forever to get good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and comedy is no different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy.</v>

478
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Music is no different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

479
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I often look at people playing piano or </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing guitar or something like that.</v>

480
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how cool would that be to be able to </v>

481
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.020
<v Speaker 1>just fucking jam on the cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But God damn,</v>

482
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of fucking time.</v>

483
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to learn that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

484
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a coordination thing for me though,</v>

485
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something.</v>

486
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Think you're just born with being able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand,</v>

487
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:33.050
<v Speaker 2>be able to coordinate each finger a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

488
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also if you do things like with </v>

489
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.940
<v Speaker 1>your fingers like that early on in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it becomes much easier as you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that um,</v>

491
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Speaker 1>the army now is using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

492
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>they're using xbox controllers for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>drones because he's fucking kids are so </v>

493
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.400
<v Speaker 1>used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And they're encouraging people to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>

495
00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just a matter of time before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start record a recruiting,</v>

496
00:21:57.561 --> 00:22:01.520
<v Speaker 1>like the baddest motherfuckers in video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games like the priority do.</v>

497
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if you could play like war </v>
<v Speaker 1>games with like a keyboard and a mouse.</v>

498
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Like there's these dudes that play </v>
<v Speaker 1>quake,</v>

499
00:22:09.171 --> 00:22:14.171
<v Speaker 1>like professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers can move that mouse </v>

500
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:16.430
<v Speaker 1>cursor and put it on an object like </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

501
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know exactly where that cursor's </v>

502
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They play so much that when they move </v>

503
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.381
<v Speaker 1>that mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouse and the keyboard is way more </v>

504
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:26.381
<v Speaker 1>accurate than that.</v>

505
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:29.910
<v Speaker 1>A joystick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Georgia thing is kind of difficult </v>

506
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.400
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate the like the toggles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where the cross.</v>

507
00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:36.401
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a mouse you can put a </v>

508
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>mouse if you understand like how quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

509
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

510
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody likes a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like high sensitivity,</v>

511
00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:45.380
<v Speaker 1>some people like low sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is once you get used</v>

512
00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>to whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move the mouse,</v>

513
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>the cursor goes in a certain directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can put it like exactly where they </v>

514
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.011
<v Speaker 1>want to instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like in you're in a </v>

515
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:57.011
<v Speaker 1>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the insurgents,</v>

516
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you gotta move the crosshairs and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in line.</v>

517
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been lying me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in like,</v>

518
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

519
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean they could do it so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

520
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be some crazy shit if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have drones and have like that</v>

521
00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:11.390
<v Speaker 1>guy fatality and fatality is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baddest motherfucking quake player ever.</v>

522
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.840
<v Speaker 1>This dude is just ridiculously accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his mind and a cool guy too.</v>

523
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Met Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice guy.</v>

524
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got that guy playing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your army and you got drones with </v>

525
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.820
<v Speaker 1>missiles in it from that fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

526
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the future man.</v>

527
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the new world.</v>

528
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy how how video games </v>
<v Speaker 2>have exploded from something that used </v>

529
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Little Ping pongs.</v>

530
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Now people have like amazing video games</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their phones.</v>

531
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Credible man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look at what you can do with your </v>

532
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.300
<v Speaker 2>iphone playing all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>racing games and shit.</v>

533
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>We were working on the new UFC.</v>

534
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>A fight game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

535
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:53.741
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch some of the graphics and </v>

536
00:23:53.741 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they dive for knee bars,</v>

537
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 1>they get triangles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw head kicks and punches,</v>

538
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>flying knees and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all this crazy shit.</v>

539
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:05.441
<v Speaker 1>All these different techniques they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do just like in real fighting and it's </v>

540
00:24:05.441 --> 00:24:08.621
<v Speaker 1>like it's so close to being like a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you like on an actual UFC fight </v>

541
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:14.951
<v Speaker 1>that you can manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the the limit is in the </v>

542
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:18.341
<v Speaker 1>controller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what eventually is going to </v>

543
00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:18.341
<v Speaker 1>happen as you're going to have a god </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn suit on,</v>

544
00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a fucking suit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're just gonna have this little </v>

545
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.941
<v Speaker 1>wire plugged in on your forehead and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just gonna think that could </v>

546
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:28.271
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Microsoft is very close to </v>

547
00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:28.271
<v Speaker 1>developing the whole system where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with the game.</v>

548
00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

549
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Nitel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes out like I think November or it</v>

550
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:36.431
<v Speaker 1>might have got pushed to spell it and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a t a l and it's pretty much just like a</v>

551
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:41.651
<v Speaker 1>camera or something that sits on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your TV and in readership motion range </v>

552
00:24:41.651 --> 00:24:41.651
<v Speaker 1>of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

553
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible because that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fucking cool.</v>

554
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Imagine having like a UFC game where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could learn how to fight without </v>

555
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.331
<v Speaker 1>actually fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem with that whole thing is I </v>

556
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 1>think maybe if I was a kid I would've </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved it,</v>

557
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.950
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm playing a video game like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have to be doing shit.</v>

558
00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 1>What you say that doing with right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just wack.</v>

559
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.360
<v Speaker 1>It's this little thing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing ping pong and it sort of moves </v>

560
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.301
<v Speaker 1>the way you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a week hard game once and I was </v>

561
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:10.301
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not specific at all.</v>

562
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not rewarding.</v>

563
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something about having to like </v>

564
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.510
<v Speaker 1>get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to do a lazy fuck.</v>

565
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:21.070
<v Speaker 1>If I was a kid it might've been better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like nowadays I want to play video </v>

566
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.760
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to sit there and smoke weed,</v>

567
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but that's dependent on the graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the graphics were like 3d </v>

568
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>fucking super dope virtual reality type </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and you had a virtual gun and </v>

569
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:36.251
<v Speaker 1>you're running down a hallway shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all because it's like you have a gun </v>

570
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>in your hand and it reads this gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

571
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:42.551
<v Speaker 1>That will be this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the actual running that you take </v>

572
00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe that would be the shit if you</v>

573
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 1>had a fucking warehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a virtual reality warehouse,</v>

574
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 1>like you enter into the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put on this helmet and it's just a </v>

575
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 1>flat or tag.</v>

576
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But complete three d,</v>

577
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:56.420

<v Speaker 1>Video Games have access to I for like 24</v>

610
00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 1>hours or something like that and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>run away.</v>

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.610
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

613
00:27:22.611 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 1>The technology never really developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I thought it was going to.</v>

614
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:29.000
<v Speaker 1>you heard about that shit like way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties and I thought wow,</v>

616
00:27:29.001 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>like there was movies based on that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

617
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like um,</v>

618
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>well sorta dagger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what movie you </v>

619
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.780
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total recall with a fucking make you </v>

620
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:41.780
<v Speaker 1>could dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

621
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>that Shit's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a total recall.</v>

622
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 1>What was the one with the chick with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>red hair in Puerto Rico.</v>

623
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.730
<v Speaker 1>They've already been able to take images</v>
<v Speaker 1>and implant them in people's minds and </v>

624
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>they been able to read images from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds,</v>

625
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.270
<v Speaker 1>like read what you're thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can look at something and the </v>

626
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.511
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some sort of sensors that </v>

627
00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 1>they hook up to your brain and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sends the image to a computer and it's,</v>

628
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.700
<v Speaker 1>it can tell what you're looking at.</v>

629
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Like that's nuts man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because eventually,</v>

630
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is in a very rudimentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages of the technology where they can </v>

631
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.851
<v Speaker 1>only pick out shapes and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually they're going to be able </v>

632
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:22.851
<v Speaker 1>to fucking see what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the element is that what was the </v>

633
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 1>ticket to red hair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fulfillment is that the Bruce Willis</v>

635
00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>to the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like memories in your head how,</v>

636
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 1>how bad ass was Chris Tucker in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

645
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.640

<v Speaker 1>if that's what it was.</v>

649
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.590
<v Speaker 1>It was strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Angela Bassett,</v>

650
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll forever be Tina Turner.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this fucking Ms Dot Beverly Hills Chair </v>

655
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.581
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one of these beauty pageant </v>

656
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>checks came out saying that she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that gays should be married.</v>

657
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:30.081
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she quoted Leviticus and the Old </v>

658
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:30.081
<v Speaker 1>Testament saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

659
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible says that it's some stupid </v>

660
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>quote like any man who lays down with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

661
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.310
<v Speaker 1>as if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

662
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way lays down with a woman </v>

663
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:40.380
<v Speaker 1>that's an abomination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be put to death.</v>

664
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So she came out and said that gays </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be put to death.</v>

665
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Lucy supporting the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

666
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:53.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you fucking want to believe </v>

667
00:29:53.311 --> 00:29:53.311
<v Speaker 1>about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good.</v>

668
00:29:53.311 --> 00:29:53.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

669
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.210
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If God is real,</v>

670
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

671
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it could be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is completely ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because God wants things confusing,</v>

673
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 1>but it gets a certain point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>read certain things and you got to go,</v>

674
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every people are full of shit.</v>

675
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And there was no internet back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

676
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a copy of the,</v>

677
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 1>the Bible on Wikipedia and people kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>altering it.</v>

678
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 1>But everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

679
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they went back and changed it.</v>

680
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

681
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.220
<v Speaker 1>The Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even write that fucking </v>

682
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>thing down for like a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just stories,</v>

683
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that those stories you </v>

684
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell a story to him and he tells</v>

685
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 1>it to his girlfriend.</v>

686
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend writes it in her blog and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same story.</v>

687
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It'll be fucked up for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many times someone </v>

688
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.231
<v Speaker 1>has gone to one of my gigs and I've said</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then a guy like will quote</v>

689
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:52.021
<v Speaker 1>on twitter like I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so funny last night when you </v>

690
00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:52.021
<v Speaker 1>said this about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

691
00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

692
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you're saying something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I said was a lot nicer,</v>

693
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when w,</v>

694
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that memories are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

695
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can be that accurate.</v>

696
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Over a thousand years were people </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

697
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>

698
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Old Testament Bible was written in </v>

699
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to this day,</v>

700
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 1>the only know three out of four words in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew,</v>

701
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>25 percent of the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a clue as to what they </v>

702
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

703
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters and numbers were the same thing.</v>

704
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:26.251
<v Speaker 1>Back then there were no numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the letter a was also the number one.</v>

705
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>So there was like numerical value in </v>
<v Speaker 1>words like the word love in the word </v>

706
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.600
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the same numerical value in </v>

707
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.211
<v Speaker 1>ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they translated that to </v>

708
00:31:39.211 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Latin and Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit was all gone.</v>

709
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all lost.</v>

710
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So for this dumb bitch to sit and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that God wants people to put,</v>

711
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 1>put the depth of their gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what the Ms Beverly Hills.</v>

712
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.930
<v Speaker 1>It's beverly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new one,</v>

713
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.931

<v Speaker 1>And California is supposed to be so </v>

714
00:31:57.931 --> 00:31:57.931
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't Miss Texas.</v>

715
00:31:57.931 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who Carrie Anne can't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is or whatever her name is.</v>

716
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.290
<v Speaker 2>She's from celebrity Rehab Niche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can each.</v>

717
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 2>She was the one that had the threesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a guy from grey's anatomy.</v>

718
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all good.</v>

809
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>But to me it seems like you can't walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

810
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather you wear tennis shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women love them,</v>

811
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love shoes.</v>

812
00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 1>They what they love how they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love.</v>

813
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like how dudes love cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:07.221
<v Speaker 1>how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see like a 69 mustang or </v>

815
00:36:07.221 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>something like that and you go whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he like pull up to a dude,</v>

816
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 1>look at that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

817
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something that men have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like women can go,</v>

818
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty car,</v>

819
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as how a dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at a car.</v>

820
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for girls,</v>

821
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the shoe thing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really fucking love shoes,</v>

822
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like makeup and shoes.</v>

823
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:29.091
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's the opposite sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body because they're so ashamed </v>

824
00:36:29.091 --> 00:36:29.091
<v Speaker 1>of the middle.</v>

825
00:36:29.091 --> 00:36:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it bleeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gross to look it up and running </v>

826
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 3>naturally long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably something like that.</v>

827
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Look how long my legs are and where do </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to look up there?</v>

828
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

829
00:36:49.341 --> 00:36:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

831
00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:53.210
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:58.211
<v Speaker 1>if you're a grown woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you like and what the fuck </v>

833

<v Speaker 1>But for little kids that's not,</v>

836
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that's not cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have a six year old dress like a </v>

837
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.690
<v Speaker 1>derby and it is disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt very wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

839
00:37:10.511 --> 00:37:12.650

<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>

842
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I believe the moms dad died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the dad's dead too.</v>

843
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.430
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

844
00:37:22.431 --> 00:37:24.350
<v Speaker 1>no twitter verse.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

852
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ties are completely ridiculous.</v>

853
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

854
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I haven't worn a tie in a long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a documentary recently on Dmt and </v>

855
00:37:53.121 --> 00:37:58.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I had to wear a tie because I </v>

856
00:37:58.121 --> 00:37:58.121
<v Speaker 1>played like a rod sterling type </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrator.</v>

857
00:37:58.121 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT.</v>

858
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It'll be out sometime this spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to wear a tie.</v>

859
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea how to tie this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

860
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time I wore a tie was um,</v>

861
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first album grabbed that thing off </v>

862
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the wall real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first album in 1999,</v>

863
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a goof,</v>

864
00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I always said that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love about being a comedian is that you,</v>

865
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:25.071
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to wear a fucking tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just my first CD for whatever </v>

866
00:38:25.071 --> 00:38:30.071
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it would be funny if I </v>

867
00:38:30.071 --> 00:38:30.071
<v Speaker 1>wore a tie.</v>

868
00:38:30.071 --> 00:38:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look strange.</v>

869
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I had to wear a tie for like 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

870
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to like work in businessman,</v>

871
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.470
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone has to know that you are </v>

872
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:47.911
<v Speaker 1>willing to wear something completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous because you're following by </v>

873
00:38:47.911 --> 00:38:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the very obvious rules of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really easy to predict </v>

874
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people like.</v>

875
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

876
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:58.320
<v Speaker 1>like as a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I feel this,</v>

877
00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gentleman who's got a tie on Hello</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

878
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen.</v>

879
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's this like this </v>

880
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:07.440
<v Speaker 1>agreement that you're not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>too crazy.</v>

881
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my Dr Phil Impression,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of are showing we are very </v>

883
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:13.980
<v Speaker 1>slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not chasing after anybody,</v>

884
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's something to that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's something to this is silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit that you wear that's </v>

886
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:20.880
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

887
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if people started doing business </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had like rash guards on like,</v>

888
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 1>like road rash guards.</v>

891
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:30.010
<v Speaker 1>But it is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>know what I'm saying?</v>

893
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running shoes on and you look like </v>

894
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you're ready to pounce on people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants that in business.</v>

895
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:43.921
<v Speaker 1>You can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to business you have to be </v>

896
00:39:43.921 --> 00:39:46.021
<v Speaker 1>dressed uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your button has to be all the way up </v>

897
00:39:46.021 --> 00:39:46.021
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:39:46.021 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

899
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

900
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember he used to work at this </v>

901
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.940
<v Speaker 4>architect firm for my stepfather and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this was when I was big into acid and </v>

902
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:58.230
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every time I would come to work I was</v>

903
00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:01.680
<v Speaker 4>either hung over a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still tripping on acid,</v>

904
00:40:01.681 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

905
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.160
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was such a boring job that it was </v>

906
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.730
<v Speaker 4>acceptable because all that I had to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>is make copies of architect plans.</v>

907
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.690
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up your brain on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you have fucked up your </v>

908
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.690
<v Speaker 1>brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

911
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.960
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if when I was doing it,</v>

912
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Was there any point that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:26.251
<v Speaker 1>you ever heard Howard stern talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is acid trip know Howard stern talks </v>

915
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.380
<v Speaker 1>about it on the radio and I guess he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a giant dose of acid,</v>

916
00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 1>like way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

917
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he was all fucked up for like a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

918
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 1>like he was hearing voices and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a,</v>

919
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 1>like a real psychotic episode and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

920
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing about psychedelics.</v>

921
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:47.440
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta make sure you don't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and do too much.</v>

922
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Like Dennis Mckenna had an experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to Dennis Mckenna,</v>

923
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.520
<v Speaker 1>who's Terence Mckenna's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both famous psychonauts for </v>

924
00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.720
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic pioneers in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to Brazil and he took like way</v>

925
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 1>too much mushrooms and he lost his mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like two weeks.</v>

926
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Like he couldn't communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

927
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last time I did DMT,</v>

928
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking whacked out for like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid weeks.</v>

929
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Not totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't guess if you were talking </v>

930
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:17.970
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally normal.</v>

931
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I did shows the shows went great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I W I went to work.</v>

932
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I did fear fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that one great.</v>

933
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:25.230
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing got fucked up in my.</v>

935
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>But my head was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've felt very,</v>

936
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like your consciousness is like</v>

937
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 1>in a foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your consciousness is like,</v>

938
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like boom,</v>

939
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:40.270
<v Speaker 1>solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is me the morning you wake up in </v>

940
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi honey,</v>

941
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.270
<v Speaker 1>kiss your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brush your teeth.</v>

942
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I did the DMT,</v>

943
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 1>my consciousness was like a little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>raft in a fucked up ocean.</v>

944
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:53.290
<v Speaker 1>like nothing seemed like I kept having </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas that cars were going to come</v>

946
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 1>launching themselves over the boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit my car while I was driving.</v>

947
00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

948
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.930
<v Speaker 1>why am I thinking so Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this about?</v>

949
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that what it was was</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are this idea of worrying about </v>

950
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.871
<v Speaker 1>possible disasters was my ego's way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regaining ground and letting me know </v>

951
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:17.231
<v Speaker 1>that it has to have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate in reality and that if you </v>

952
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:23.651
<v Speaker 1>want to do crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy psychedelics and go into other </v>

953
00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:24.880
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with entities and reevaluate</v>

954
00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:30.690
<v Speaker 1>your whole position in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then humankind's positioned with </v>

956
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.810
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all well and good,</v>

957
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's some real shit in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the ego has to be there for.</v>

958
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And the ego was like sending me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

959
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if a fucking car launched itself </v>

960
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better be fucking paying attention.</v>

961
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.191
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a certain amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where it was such a mind blowing </v>

962
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:51.761
<v Speaker 1>experience that there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling match going on in my head </v>

963
00:42:51.761 --> 00:42:55.931
<v Speaker 1>between my ego in between this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and accepting all this new </v>

964
00:42:55.931 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 1>information from the psychedelic trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

965
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and incorporating it into the way I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at everyday life.</v>

966
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.800
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

967
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about someone who's like a </v>

968
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:06.130
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shaman.</v>

969
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're living in the jungle and they're</v>

970
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:10.691
<v Speaker 1>all at peace in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not calling people douche bags </v>

971
00:43:10.691 --> 00:43:10.691
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

972
00:43:10.691 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment that if you achieve it,</v>

973
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make it very hard for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to function in the regular world and I </v>

974
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 1>think that's one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about psychedelic trips.</v>

975
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:25.331
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of cripples in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic world and then the weed </v>

976
00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 1>world too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that they're.</v>

977
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:32.170
<v Speaker 1>They're so into these experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't incorporate it into their </v>

978
00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:37.271
<v Speaker 1>everyday life and they're almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>crippled in their everyday life because </v>

979
00:43:37.271 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 1>of it and no psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth anything.</v>

980
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Unless you can take what you've learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it and enhance regular life,</v>

981
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>enhance your communication with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationships with people you know,</v>

982
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 1>enhance the way you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance your career path.</v>

983
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.120
<v Speaker 1>You know the kind of friends you hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with,</v>

984
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:58.130
<v Speaker 1>unless it can enhance you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is we live in this world for</v>

985
00:43:58.131 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 1>eight hours a day or 12 hours a day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>however long you're awake.</v>

986
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 1>This world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit,</v>

987
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:07.451
<v Speaker 1>this concrete world is real and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage your way through this and </v>

988
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.100
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs make it very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

989
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:11.090
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have a regular job.</v>

990
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I think psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the main thing with psychedelics </v>

991
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.270
<v Speaker 4>is that opens up a door and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the past,</v>

992
00:44:16.271 --> 00:44:21.271
<v Speaker 4>like I've been offered dmt but I won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it because I like when I first did </v>

993
00:44:21.271 --> 00:44:24.510
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms that opened up to a door or </v>
<v Speaker 4>things I never thought of or saw before.</v>

994
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 4>And it's never gonna go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

995
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 4>it didn't damage my head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that I know that exists,</v>

996
00:44:28.741 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 4>I know it's there and so when acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing,</v>

997
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 4>but there's a point where I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

998
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 4>is this door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does this store need to be open?</v>

999
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Is this anything positive with this door</v>
<v Speaker 4>being open?</v>

1000
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 4>And some drugs are like that for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>because like a Salvia was the closest to</v>

1001
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:44.850
<v Speaker 4>the point where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1002
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:49.851
<v Speaker 4>that is a scary door that I opened up </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that just pretty much made </v>

1003
00:44:49.851 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 4>everything seem fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1004
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 4>like it was like this world is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is fake and I know that's not</v>

1005
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:58.881
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it opened up that door where I'm </v>

1006
00:44:58.881 --> 00:44:58.881
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1007
00:44:58.881 --> 00:45:00.070
<v Speaker 4>that's almost too much of a door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have opened up that door.</v>

1008
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

1009
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.290
<v Speaker 4>That thought of not knowing that was,</v>

1010
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty more pretty much saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1011
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It may if you can't bring it back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into your everyday life and</v>

1012
00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:13.810
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you open up these doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1013
00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.500
<v Speaker 1>the fuck am I going to do with this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your everyday life is just whacked out.</v>

1014
00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Some people like going back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fake world so much though,</v>

1015
00:45:20.831 --> 00:45:25.831
<v Speaker 1>and that's where it gets fucking scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think most of those </v>

1016
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:25.930
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their real world is not so hot,</v>

1017
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why it </v>

1018
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 1>becomes an escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1019
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it should be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>

1020
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should ever escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1021
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.840
<v Speaker 1>You're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1022
00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.610
<v Speaker 1>this is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1023
00:45:36.611 --> 00:45:39.910
<v Speaker 1>there's life can be magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking intense,</v>

1024
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.030
<v Speaker 1>fantastic experience if you manage it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

1025
00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.030
<v Speaker 1>But if you just want to escape all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1026
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I've got to think that you're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking up in this life and that's </v>

1027
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 1>imbalanced.</v>

1028
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.360
<v Speaker 1>You know the people that always want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1029
00:45:52.361 --> 00:45:57.361
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the same thing with like video </v>

1030
00:45:57.361 --> 00:45:57.361
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I told you about this dude.</v>

1031
00:45:57.361 --> 00:46:01.490
<v Speaker 1>There's this dude who used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager at the comedy store that was </v>

1032
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.270
<v Speaker 1>addicted to everquest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just completely addicted.</v>

1033
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1034
00:46:02.951 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost everything,</v>

1035
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.480
<v Speaker 1>lost his job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost his life.</v>

1036
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.020
<v Speaker 1>He just was so pale you would see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so pale,</v>

1037
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 1>looked like he never saw sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would order in food and never </v>

1038
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.800
<v Speaker 1>leave the fucking house for days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came down to the comedy store one</v>

1039
00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of those,</v>

1040
00:46:18.731 --> 00:46:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so good at making money in my online</v>

1041
00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:27.871
<v Speaker 1>life and so bad in my real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was starting to realize that like </v>

1042
00:46:27.881 --> 00:46:31.120
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking loser in this life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's.</v>

1043
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:36.430
<v Speaker 1>He's excited and puts all of his passion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and energy into this other life.</v>

1044
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:41.050
<v Speaker 1>But that's just really because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other life is a new and exciting thing.</v>

1045
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new and artificial thing and he can </v>

1046
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.241
<v Speaker 1>control it from his computer without </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with emotions and dealing with </v>

1047
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:48.241
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1048
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the fears and anxieties and the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world presents.</v>

1049
00:46:49.721 --> 00:46:54.721
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is if we live the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a computer screen and we were offered</v>

1050
00:46:55.031 --> 00:47:00.031
<v Speaker 1>the real world as a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world will be so much more </v>

1051
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:00.580
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1052
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>we just don't think of it as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic because we're so goddamn used </v>

1053
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1054
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.770
<v Speaker 1>if we lived life in a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a computer monitor and that's how you</v>

1055
00:47:08.771 --> 00:47:11.080
<v Speaker 1>were when you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day someone said,</v>

1056
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1057
00:47:11.741 --> 00:47:16.741
<v Speaker 1>we've developed this new game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to go outside and you go </v>

1058
00:47:16.741 --> 00:47:20.311
<v Speaker 1>outside and you'd actually get laid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go and have a real drink and </v>

1059
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:20.311
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>

1060
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You do a real shot of Jack Daniels would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1061
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is real.</v>

1062
00:47:22.841 --> 00:47:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1063
00:47:24.251 --> 00:47:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd go get laid for real and you drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car for rail.</v>

1064
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.940
<v Speaker 1>You'd really like to the world stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit.</v>

1065
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 1>You would never want to play video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1066
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:38.070
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we want to play video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games is because it's a world that we </v>

1067
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 1>can control completely independent from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

1068
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1069
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>the like the pros and cons of this solid</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1070
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.530
<v Speaker 1>completely independent of the emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the insecurities and all the shit </v>

1071
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>that we all experience but we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1072
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why we experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurities and anxiety and anger,</v>

1073
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.580
<v Speaker 1>these are all like little chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>signals to guide you through towards a </v>

1074
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 1>proper life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I've found in life,</v>

1075
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 1>most importantly more than anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the one,</v>

1076
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 1>the way that I'm the most happiest is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting out positive energy.</v>

1077
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting out positive energy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1078
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 1>two friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive energy on stage,</v>

1079
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.710
<v Speaker 1>positive energy with my writing and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with,</v>

1080
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:20.730
<v Speaker 1>with anything I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all friendly and positive and </v>

1081
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:20.730
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that,</v>

1082
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a fucking fantastic life.</v>

1083
00:48:22.481 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it's just difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1084
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to lose your temper.</v>

1085
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to be obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and get sidetracked and that's</v>

1086
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:37.471
<v Speaker 1>where like gambling addictions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbation addictions and all that </v>

1087
00:48:37.471 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that's all about.</v>

1088
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trying to distract </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself from,</v>

1089
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 1>from all the pain of being a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1090
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fucking hunter s Thompson had a </v>

1091
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.181
<v Speaker 1>quote like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a man making himself a beast to,</v>

1092
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 1>to get away from the pain of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1093
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I forget exactly what the quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something along those lines,</v>

1094
00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 1>like we distract the shit of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the game of life is fucking hard</v>

1095
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1096
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a video game is hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1097
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember like back when I used to </v>

1098
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>play quake like all the time I played </v>
<v Speaker 1>quake like hours and hours a day and you</v>

1099
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:14.941
<v Speaker 1>and I played quake online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We played against each other and like </v>

1100
00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:17.911
<v Speaker 1>you can tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's playing all the time </v>

1101
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:17.911
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1102
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you get really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1103
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know where the rockets are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1104
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And I was sticking rail guns up your ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>and electric.</v>

1105
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you want 120 games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I won one.</v>

1106
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully not fair.</v>

1107
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 1>And like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

1108
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>there's dudes online that would do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

1109
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Just raped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1110
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Because they had put so much time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking crazy game.</v>

1111
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.960
<v Speaker 1>They would get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since you hadn't put time,</v>

1112
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 1>how frustrating was it?</v>

1113
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 1>So she didn't want to play right now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to shut it off.</v>

1114
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the same as life.</v>

1115
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.340
<v Speaker 1>If you get good at life with the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's fun as fuck.</v>

1116
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1117
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're Leonardo Dicaprio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life must be the shit.</v>

1118
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started in movies driving a Ferrari </v>

1119
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 1>for models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1120
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He's got a gigantic fucking mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a,</v>

1121
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:02.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had been.</v>

1122
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Must be so fun for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not everybody can be Leonardo </v>

1123
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Dicaprio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the fucking garbage man </v>

1124
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.090
<v Speaker 1>came home and his wife is fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper Guy.</v>

1126
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a fun life.</v>

1127
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:15.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1128
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:19.880
<v Speaker 1>that's just like a guy who's not good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick getting murdered in a game.</v>

1129
00:50:19.881 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1130
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like playing pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're good.</v>

1131
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I played pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love pull up,</v>

1132
00:50:24.011 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I get obsessed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a friend,</v>

1133
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:31.261
<v Speaker 1>my friend Max eberly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a professional and he's a top </v>

1134
00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:31.261
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>

1135
00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's capable of winning when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in stroke,</v>

1136
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 1>capable of winning any tournament in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1137
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:40.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's really fucking good and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play against him sometimes it's so </v>

1138
00:50:40.391 --> 00:50:44.710
<v Speaker 1>frustrating and I played pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for a regular person I played good </v>

1139
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 1>but for like a pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even fucking close.</v>

1140
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:52.660
<v Speaker 1>So when I play Max it's just getting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass handed to me it's just getting </v>

1141
00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.561
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time it's fun is when we play </v>

1142
00:50:56.561 --> 00:50:56.561
<v Speaker 1>on a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tight table,</v>

1143
00:50:56.561 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 1>so occasion when he misses and then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1144
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to shoot,</v>

1145
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's much better at that game.</v>

1146
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.550
<v Speaker 1>We used to give him a handicap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1147
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we know,</v>

1148
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't play for anything.</v>

1149
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for me because you get used to</v>

1150
00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:10.040
<v Speaker 1>playing against a guy like that.</v>

1151
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not as fun as playing against a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like your speed,</v>

1152
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good for your game </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes sure that you </v>

1153
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.130
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on every mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll play a guy who's not as</v>

1154
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 1>good as you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry about this because,</v>

1163
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Mic L Hiney mcelhinney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what about words and names like </v>

1164
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Swartz and anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did that ever get through?</v>

1165
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what culture ran out of sounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People string together.</v>

1166
00:51:56.271 --> 00:52:01.271
<v Speaker 1>Something nutty like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that like to write in cursive is </v>

1167
00:52:01.271 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 1>that is going to be the best cursive </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing I've ever seen.</v>

1168
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Manuscripts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slaves to write it on a page and they </v>

1169
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 1>didn't have lines in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just had paper and they would write</v>

1170
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:11.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1171
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of the Voynich </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuscript?</v>

1172
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 1>The voynich manuscript?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm saying it right,</v>

1173
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 1>is this ancient manuscript that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a ton,</v>

1174
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:27.041
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years old and they have no </v>

1175
00:52:27.041 --> 00:52:29.591
<v Speaker 1>fucking idea what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the language covered </v>

1176
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:29.591
<v Speaker 1>under any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

1177
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:33.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't know if it's just nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some guy was just practicing </v>

1178
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 1>scribble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like really long and it's A.</v>

1179
00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his consistency in how it's written,</v>

1180
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:42.071
<v Speaker 1>but they can't decode it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had like top encryption experts </v>

1181
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's like it's very divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe it's a hoax and some</v>

1182
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 1>people believe that it's some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost language and some people think that</v>

1183
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:53.171
<v Speaker 1>it's gloss gloss of Lelea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when someone talks in tongues and </v>

1184
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that they just went into a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans.</v>

1185
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Some retired with a pennant now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got really good writing.</v>

1186
00:52:57.771 --> 00:53:02.771
<v Speaker 1>It's got diagrams in it and really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good illustrations rather and </v>

1187
00:53:02.771 --> 00:53:03.770
<v Speaker 1>diagrams and it's like a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1188
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it's really complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and they found that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that temple and Turkey that is 7,000</v>

1190
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:14.670
<v Speaker 1>years older than the Pyramids are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex stone temple carved out of stone</v>

1191
00:53:14.671 --> 00:53:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and shit and now they have to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewrite,</v>

1192
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:22.210
<v Speaker 1>like human history because like 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years before Egypt has 9,000,</v>

1193
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:24.470
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC and 10,000</v>

1194
00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:29.471
<v Speaker 1>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were already like had temples and </v>

1195
00:53:29.471 --> 00:53:31.401
<v Speaker 1>we're worshiping shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like that throws a monkey wrench </v>

1196
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:32.180
<v Speaker 1>into the whole gears of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

1197
00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a cultural evolution,</v>

1198
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this been this Guy John </v>

1199
00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West,</v>

1200
00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.880
<v Speaker 1>look that up on Google because this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fascinating.</v>

1201
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:46.881
<v Speaker 1>He's got an awesome DVD series called </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical Egypt and this guy is obsessed </v>

1202
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 1>with Egypt.</v>

1203
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He spent his entire life studying Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believes that the Egyptian </v>

1204
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 1>culture goes back way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1205
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:59.991
<v Speaker 1>way before the established timelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the established timelines for </v>

1206
00:53:59.991 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian culture is like 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

1207
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>That's when they think like the pyramids</v>
<v Speaker 1>were built and that the culture goes </v>

1208
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>back a little bit before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

1209
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks it goes back like 35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1210
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that people have been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1211
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:14.780
<v Speaker 1>way longer and that there was some big </v>
<v Speaker 1>break somewhere along the line,</v>

1212
00:54:14.781 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 1>like probably some sort of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic disaster,</v>

1213
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 1>like a meteor impact or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1214
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could be,</v>

1215
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000,</v>

1216
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:23.520
<v Speaker 1>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1217
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:28.521
<v Speaker 1>like they don't know when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think that there was like an </v>

1218
00:54:28.521 --> 00:54:30.971
<v Speaker 1>advanced culture and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got fucked up and then culture </v>

1219
00:54:30.971 --> 00:54:33.060
<v Speaker 1>rebuilds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society rebuilds and then what's left is</v>

1220
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:38.061
<v Speaker 1>like they're living in the shit that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>made thousands and thousands of years </v>

1221
00:54:38.061 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 1>ago and they tried to imitate it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate it and they can't.</v>

1222
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>And he believes that that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these,</v>

1223
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:43.150
<v Speaker 1>these fucked up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1224
00:54:43.151 --> 00:54:48.151
<v Speaker 1>So they have in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that these pyramids were like </v>

1225
00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 1>the first pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks much,</v>

1226
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 1>much more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These pyramids were probably like,</v>

1227
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 1>people were like trying to duplicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit,</v>

1228
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.340
<v Speaker 1>duplicate shit that was already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1229
00:54:56.341 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 1>they believe that that's don't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not his theory.</v>

1230
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:00.920
<v Speaker 1>That's someone else's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His theory is I'm,</v>

1231
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is about the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought in geologists,</v>

1232
00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 1>the geologists have like documented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>erosion on the sphinx and they say </v>

1233
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's water or roadnet like thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years of rainfall,</v>

1234
00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 1>of cut deep fissures in the whole entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>enclosure with a sphinxes.</v>

1235
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time there was rainfall in the Nile </v>

1236
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Valley was like $709,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

1237
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1238
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pyramids and the Sphinx rather would</v>

1239
00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:30.681
<v Speaker 1>have to be like 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years older than the established </v>

1240
00:55:30.681 --> 00:55:30.681
<v Speaker 1>timeline.</v>

1241
00:55:30.681 --> 00:55:31.940
<v Speaker 1>And so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the,</v>

1242
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the egyptologists like the guys who have</v>

1243
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 1>been teaching forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Pyramids and the Sphinx and all</v>

1244
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 1>that was built about 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

1245
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>They never want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to accept it.</v>

1246
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1247
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:42.690
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence for this culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1248
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 1>it's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1249
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking rainfall for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years have created this.</v>

1250
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And geologists are universal about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one is disputing that.</v>

1251
00:55:51.031 --> 00:55:53.150
<v Speaker 1>The geologists are all saying he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung.</v>

1252
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.700
<v Speaker 1>This guy ron shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

1253
00:55:54.701 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor at Boston University,</v>

1254
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>has got over 100 professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1255
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:06.410
<v Speaker 1>professors geologists to sign off on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that this is undoubtedly water </v>

1256
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:11.931
<v Speaker 1>erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which completely changes the timeline </v>

1257
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:11.931
<v Speaker 1>for when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1258
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sphinx was built and there's a bunch</v>

1259
00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 1>of that shit going on in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt.</v>

1260
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.160
<v Speaker 1>They believe that it's like probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

1262
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:25.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a mass extinction took place on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth somewhere around 10,000</v>

1263
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1264
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the woolly mammoth died </v>

1265
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the saber tooth tigers died.</v>

1266
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Noah's Ark now this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1267
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10,000</v>

1268
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>

1269
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 1>like half of North America was under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile high sheet of ice.</v>

1270
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Like there was an ice age going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something killed it and ended it like </v>

1271
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously and they don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1272
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very likely that it was a fucking </v>

1273
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.981
<v Speaker 1>natural disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very likely that it was a fucking </v>

1274
00:56:58.981 --> 00:57:01.321
<v Speaker 1>meat here impacted some what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guys are distracting the shit out </v>

1275
00:57:01.321 --> 00:57:01.321
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't look at me,</v>

1276
00:57:01.321 --> 00:57:06.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking have a monitor open in </v>

1277
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.831
<v Speaker 1>front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude Surf and he's not even paying </v>

1278
00:57:07.831 --> 00:57:07.831
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do one week podcast.</v>

1279
00:57:07.831 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 1>This dude is so addicted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1280
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:11.740
<v Speaker 1>He can't even talk for one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you talk before,</v>

1281
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you've heard me talk about this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

1282
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 675 people,</v>

1283
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but have not heard this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at him.</v>

1284
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faggot.</v>

1285
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people have been around way </v>

1286
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.681
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more likely that it's </v>

1287
00:57:28.681 --> 00:57:31.321
<v Speaker 1>just really ridiculous that people still</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in and how long this </v>

1288
00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 1>world's been around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1289
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people have believed the earth,</v>

1290
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

1291
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 1>It just drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1292
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:42.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how not monster number more than </v>

1293
00:57:42.331 --> 00:57:42.331
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to a Gallup poll,</v>

1294
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same because I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing about poles.</v>

1295
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 1>You can't say like according to a recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>poll,</v>

1296
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of Americans believe this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1297
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1298
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:58.501
<v Speaker 1>According to your recent poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of Americans who are fucking </v>

1299
00:57:58.501 --> 00:57:59.510
<v Speaker 1>retarded enough to answer your poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in that.</v>

1300
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:04.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of polls are never </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of anybody intelligent </v>

1301
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 1>because you can't get me to answer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking pole.</v>

1302
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 1>We can't get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got shit to do.</v>

1303
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have a hobby?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear somebody calls you.</v>

1304
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:12.170
<v Speaker 1>May I have five minutes of your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1305
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that's for like old ladies who have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

1306
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mom.</v>

1307
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at this glitter more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking super baked and I just don't</v>

1308
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 1>want to hang up from a person and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1309
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five minutes.</v>

1310
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be nice.</v>

1311
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polls represent the retards.</v>

1312
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1313
00:58:28.621 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1314
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dollar.</v>

1315
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:31.950
<v Speaker 1>You're answering polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

1316
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I do a poll as if I think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win something,</v>

1317
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:41.311
<v Speaker 1>if I answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 percent of Americans can't fund the </v>

1318
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>United States on a globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that True Joe?</v>

1319
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Beef don't be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Job is line job.</v>

1320
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 1>If it didn't make that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solar flares up in 2012,</v>

1321
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're clashing the galactic equator than</v>

1322
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1323
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy which is Richard Tyson.</v>

1324
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name as a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that guy's name?</v>

1325
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 1>The astronomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1326
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Neil Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil Tyson.</v>

1327
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent guy and I really like </v>

1328
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 1>listening to them talk and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he said about this whole crossing</v>

1329
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:12.790
<v Speaker 1>the aquatic whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1330
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 1>What is the exact way this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>galactic equator.</v>

1331
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what this guy said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the.</v>

1332
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:24.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're crossing the center of the </v>

1333
00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:24.271
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>

1334
00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Everything's in line on December 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>

1335
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 1>You know what he says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that happens all the time.</v>

1336
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Says he says that like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like line up with the center of the </v>

1337
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.260
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it doesn't,</v>

1338
00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen then because goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time and nothing </v>

1339
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.541
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows if he's right or if he's </v>

1340
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like super skeptical,</v>

1341
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:48.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's much more likely it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in 2012 or something </v>

1342
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:48.850
<v Speaker 1>technological.</v>

1343
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Something technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy invention,</v>

1344
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think it be anything.</v>

1345
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It could be that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that 2012.</v>

1346
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 1>What really happens is nothing happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people realize,</v>

1347
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to actually manage this life.</v>

1348
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>We can't just rely on fucking aliens </v>
<v Speaker 1>landing.</v>

1349
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I was more scared about 2000 just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if that makes sense.</v>

1350
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>All the computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes dropping from the sky.</v>

1351
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I was scared to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1352
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do a Gig in 2000.</v>

1353
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I stayed home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought for sure there was at least </v>

1354
01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>going to be something small when </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars.</v>

1355
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that that's 10 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1356
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Time is just fucking flying by man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy fast.</v>

1357
01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Too Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost feels like it's quicker every </v>

1358
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>year and everybody says that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what time really is quicker would if</v>

1359
01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:39.391
<v Speaker 1>like clocks are moving quicker to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just can't really establish it </v>

1360
01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>because that wouldn't make sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about digital clocks?</v>

1361
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They all exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this fucking dimension.</v>

1362
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a dimension is moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

1363
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Units of timer know almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're forgetting more so it </v>

1364
01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:56.771
<v Speaker 1>feels like we're forgetting more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day because we have more </v>

1365
01:00:56.771 --> 01:00:58.781
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe thoughts on those guys movement,</v>

1366
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think about zeitgeists and all </v>

1367
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of.</v>

1368
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's poorly researched like the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said about Mithra and different,</v>

1369
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>different gods and stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just like Jesus loved was </v>

1370
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>really poorly researched and incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and been proven wrong.</v>

1371
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a website that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1372
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a common debunkings I guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1373
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1374
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>what the website is titled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the guy just breaks down all </v>

1375
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>the errors that the dude who made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie made and it's just,</v>

1376
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1377
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>he's quoting references and showing very</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly that,</v>

1378
01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1379
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>the guys guys made some big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1380
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>big fuck ups and I think his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how sure he is.</v>

1381
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>That's September 11th was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1382
01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed and the,</v>

1383
01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1384
01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>and perpetrated by the US government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tower one tower two fell because </v>

1385
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were detonated.</v>

1386
01:02:03.141 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sure that,</v>

1387
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1388
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>no one's sure that that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say free spot.</v>

1389
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this talk of free fall speed and the</v>

1390
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>towers fell at free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fall speed.</v>

1391
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fell pretty fucking fast.</v>

1392
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>But that's what happens when shit falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

1393
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it falls apart pretty fucking fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially shit that's super heavy and </v>

1394
01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>gigantic and all that weight is on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all just collapsing.</v>

1395
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a building that way and you fly a </v>

1396
01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant plane filled with jet fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

1397
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>The only way to really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can have theories,</v>

1398
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but the only way to really know is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build another building and fly another </v>

1399
01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:42.201
<v Speaker 1>jet into exactly the same way and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens and if it falls down </v>

1400
01:02:42.201 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>exactly like that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the argument's pretty much over.</v>

1401
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't then you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1402
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what was inside the building?</v>

1403
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Did it all burn the same was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it exactly constructed the same?</v>

1404
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to try it again.</v>

1405
01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have more than two buildings</v>

1406
01:02:55.591 --> 01:03:00.591
<v Speaker 1>to go on and everybody's like buildings </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fallen before and the </v>

1407
01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>government does some nasty evil shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely a fact,</v>

1408
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what happened there.</v>

1409
01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:10.461
<v Speaker 1>And to say that you know is just as bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>as people who blindly trust in the US </v>

1410
01:03:10.461 --> 01:03:15.440
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that question that I have a </v>

1411
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 1>big question about when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>September 11th is tower seven and if you</v>

1412
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>watch video online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video of tower seven falling and</v>

1413
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it falls just like a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>

1414
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just goes straight down all at</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and it's,</v>

1415
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy to watch man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1416
01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:34.221
<v Speaker 1>because like it implodes from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement down in every level falls apart</v>

1417
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:38.040
<v Speaker 1>including like jets of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy,</v>

1418
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 1>like spraying out of windows.</v>

1419
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there's blasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that could be because it's </v>

1420
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a whole floor of error </v>

1421
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>being registered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

1422
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.450
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is it all falls the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same time in that building wasn't </v>

1423
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>even hit by a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on fire and it had a whole minute</v>

1424
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>from like debris and stuff and I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it falling down,</v>

1425
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but there was a hole in one corner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

1426
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:03.741
<v Speaker 1>if it's a hole there and the building's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to collapse when it collapsed </v>

1427
01:04:03.741 --> 01:04:03.741
<v Speaker 1>towards the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1428
01:04:03.741 --> 01:04:03.741
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that make sense?</v>

1429
01:04:03.741 --> 01:04:05.420
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also makes sense.</v>

1430
01:04:05.421 --> 01:04:07.730
<v Speaker 4>The whole poc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing on a pop can thing.</v>

1431
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Wherever you stand on a pop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you knock a little bit off the side?</v>

1432
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not falling over,</v>

1433
01:04:12.411 --> 01:04:14.450
<v Speaker 4>you're going straight down the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1434
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.330
<v Speaker 4>meaning it's so heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if there's a hole on it,</v>

1435
01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.300
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just going straight down and that's</v>

1436
01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:21.770
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I,</v>

1437
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.360
<v Speaker 4>I think with all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1438
01:04:23.361 --> 01:04:28.361
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad there's people that freak out </v>

1439
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:28.361
<v Speaker 4>about and care about it because without </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1440
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government's going to get away with </v>

1441
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in my opinion,</v>

1442
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if the government didn't </v>

1443
01:04:34.681 --> 01:04:34.681
<v Speaker 4>fuck they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1444
01:04:34.681 --> 01:04:35.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm still waking up eating cereal.</v>

1445
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Well that is one thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>

1446
01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you,</v>

1447
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean,</v>

1448
01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>how is this going to help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's this going to help you in your </v>

1449
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.241
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know if you get obsessed with this </v>

1450
01:04:47.241 --> 01:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>much tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the bottom line people to think </v>

1451
01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>the government wouldn't kill people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody died and tower seven supposedly,</v>

1452
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but the people don't believe people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the government would not kill </v>

1453
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all you need to know for sure.</v>

1454
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>They start wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then don't need to be started.</v>

1455
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent fact for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gulf of Tonkin incident that got us </v>

1456
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:10.351
<v Speaker 1>into the Vietnam war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a fake fucking attack on </v>

1457
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They faked it and they faked it and made</v>

1458
01:05:11.831 --> 01:05:16.831
<v Speaker 1>this big deal about it so that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get fired up and realize we have </v>

1459
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:16.831
<v Speaker 1>to go to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fact.</v>

1460
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>This is history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1461
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that they wrote up a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>called operation northwoods.</v>

1462
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>The northwoods document in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwoods document was they were </v>

1463
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>planning attacks on Americans and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to.</v>

1464
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>This is in 1962 and they were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of </v>

1465
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1466
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>and vetoed by Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to attack one time,</v>

1467
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>obey there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to lob grenades into and </v>

1468
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>mortars and to Guantanamo Bay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly kill American soldiers.</v>

1469
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>They were going to blow up a jetliner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blame it on the Cubans and they were</v>

1470
01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:48.120
<v Speaker 1>going to tell Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to go to war with Cuba.</v>

1471
01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to fucking die in a war</v>

1472
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>for sure and people are going to die in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a war that Americans didn't want.</v>

1473
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:58.801
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided to do what's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>a false flag and make attacks on </v>

1474
01:05:58.801 --> 01:06:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Americans and blame it on the Cubans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fact.</v>

1475
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And only 3000 people died in September </v>

1476
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>11 for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people.</v>

1477
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making light of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think comparison to how many people </v>

1478
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 1>have died in Iraq during the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

1479
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:17.910
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about like a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilians have died in Iraq since the </v>

1480
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920
<v Speaker 1>invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million.</v>

1481
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking right.</v>

1482
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean millions of people die from that </v>

1483
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 2>earthquake in Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't have it.</v>

1484
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Hd video fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1485
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Seeing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1486
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not responsible for that.</v>

1487
01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:30.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1488
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1489
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:34.120
<v Speaker 2>but I think the reason why is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to kill people.</v>

1490
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1491
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why we were focused </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it though,</v>

1492
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:38.970
<v Speaker 2>it's just because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we all watched it live where,</v>

1493
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we saw these people in a racket shot,</v>

1494
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.990
<v Speaker 2>live on tv would probably be just as big</v>
<v Speaker 2>as nine slash 11.</v>

1495
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 2>You now.</v>

1496
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

1497
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1498
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the idea was it was an </v>

1499
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.990
<v Speaker 1>attack on American soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what was such a big</v>

1500
01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all mean.</v>

1501
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I remember how everybody gets so </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotic after afterwards.</v>

1502
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember after September 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had fucking American flags on </v>

1503
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:04.830
<v Speaker 1>their car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that weird feeling?</v>

1504
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You were you still in Ohio back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1505
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have them in Ohio?</v>

1506
01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left,</v>

1507
01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:16.831
<v Speaker 1>I went to work one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think I was doing fear </v>

1508
01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:16.831
<v Speaker 1>factor at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been,</v>

1509
01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but I was driving down down the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>near my house and every fucking car had </v>

1510
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 1>an American flag on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy and I was like,</v>

1511
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>this is just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird feeling.</v>

1512
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people are blowing up,</v>

1513
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like they're ready to just go to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

1514
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize like how war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking culture really is and,</v>

1515
01:07:35.311 --> 01:07:40.311
<v Speaker 1>and how sheep like and how people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just immediately willing to fight and </v>

1516
01:07:40.311 --> 01:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>fight who don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who did it are dead.</v>

1517
01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a suicide attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people that were responsible for </v>

1518
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>the deaths of those people are all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1519
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>unless you're one of those crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers that doesn't believe that </v>

1520
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>it was a real plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1521
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were piloted by remote control</v>

1522
01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>on the planes were emptying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows shit happened.</v>

1523
01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Almost wait is this almost 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

1524
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm still talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1525
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so frustrating talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who claim to know.</v>

1526
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 1>That's when it's really frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1527
01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a plane hit the Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a missile,</v>

1528
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.540
<v Speaker 1>whereas all the people that died in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking plane crash then did they.</v>

1529
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>They took them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why would they say it's a plane?</v>

1530
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Why would they shoot a missile and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a plane.</v>

1531
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Why we're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the plane parts on the lawn.</v>

1532
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1533
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:29.081
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about this before this </v>

1534
01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we actually last week or two weeks </v>

1535
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fear factor real.</v>

1536
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how much acid you take.</v>

1537
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan hates Bruce springsteen is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

1538
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to get attention,</v>

1539
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:39.210
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1540
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey Bruce springsteen born to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fucking brilliant </v>

1541
01:08:44.271 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>disguise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fucking song.</v>

1542
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Do I don't love all bruce springsteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sit through a three </v>

1543
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.781
<v Speaker 1>hour concert of anybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be like Richard Pryor </v>

1544
01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>would have to come back from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Floyd do three.</v>

1545
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I might sit through three hours of pink </v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's.</v>

1546
01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

1547
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:03.700

<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>rolling stone album the other day </v>

1553
01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.280
<v Speaker 1>because it had one song on it that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked.</v>

1554
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of the album was dog shit.</v>

1555
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's the rolling stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1556
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many great songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>

1557
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.830
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of fucking albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>if you go back into some of those older </v>
<v Speaker 1>albums and listen to some of those songs</v>

<v Speaker 1>orangey,</v>

1564
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like with more than 10 people having sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same room.</v>

1565
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like you walk in and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on here at </v>

1566

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.360

<v Speaker 1>to fuck like a bunch of different dudes </v>

1602
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>at the same time like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something.</v>

1603
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1605
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I like hot sauce.</v>

1606
01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 1>You like hot sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spicy food.</v>

1607

<v Speaker 1>my tongue is on fire now.</v>

1610
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>The most people they wouldn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I liked that for some weird reason.</v>

1611
01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some girls just like Dixon </v>

1612
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they like it.</v>

1613
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:26.700

<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1614
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe maybe they're broken,</v>

1615
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>always make the faces all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1651
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I found myself doing it on normal faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like it'd be my mom,</v>

1652
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1655
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Now I have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I stopped in the face </v>

1656
01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:24.960
<v Speaker 1>because it was something that was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>

1657
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:29.990
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a thing that went on for </v>

1658
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 1>literally like five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I took a picture with someone</v>

1659
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:34.620
<v Speaker 1>someone came to a show and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a picture with me.</v>

1661
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Every time Brian was behind them like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and there's,</v>

1662
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.880
<v Speaker 1>we have to organize them and put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1663
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:42.570
<v Speaker 1>on my space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of them are.</v>

1664
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 1>But the other one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about no bullshit.</v>

1665
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Five years worth of shows.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're going to fuck though.</v>

1669
01:13:59.391 --> 01:14:04.050

<v Speaker 1>that made me realize I need to stop </v>

1670

<v Speaker 2>then and oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1682
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>or I'll put that shit up and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>flicker.</v>

1683
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1684
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I do whatever I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I bought David Lee Roth.</v>

1685
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

1686
01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't wait to one day where David </v>

1687
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Lee rocked</v>

1688
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.560
<v Speaker 1>won't</v>

1689
01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 2>be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe so we can release that video or </v>

1690
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you won't be at this video of us all </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with David Lee Roth.</v>

1691
01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like he doesn't kill him to say </v>

1692
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 2>about it right now because he told us </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to talk about it.</v>

1693
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1694
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.400

<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1695
01:15:04.401 --> 01:15:06.530
<v Speaker 2>So the last thing we should do is talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what's on the video.</v>

1696
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I just say we all sat around and talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we love bullshit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You were saying you can't wait until he </v>

1698
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:15.851
<v Speaker 2>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can release it and then then just so</v>

1699
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>we can show it to people because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>so awesome.</v>

1704
01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It was basically just David Lee Roth </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about crazy road stories and </v>

1705
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.401

1708
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.550
<v Speaker 1>listening to his albums at gold circle </v>
