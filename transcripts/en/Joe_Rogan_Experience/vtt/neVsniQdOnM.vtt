<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.230

<v Speaker 1>a silly statement like I could kill a</v>

4
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>wolf</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much fucking night.</v>

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>The people are so excited about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen,</v>

6
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

7
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just tweet random shit all the</v>

8
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>time and that just for some reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody had an opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one,</v>

10
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny though.</v>

11
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of people tweet really</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit,</v>

12
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything get this much speculation,</v>

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>People are mad at you if have pissed</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>can't be wolf.</v>

17
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

18
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing,</v>

19
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>The social media today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must,</v>

21
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

22
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I think you said it at a time where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were looking for some shit to</v>

23
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:07.051
<v Speaker 1>argue that has nothing to do with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with climate change.</v>

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:13.261
<v Speaker 1>we got something here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I can be that source of a</v>

26
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>distressed containment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

28
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you caught like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like peaks and waves</v>

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>because if you did this the day nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 happened,</v>

30
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would give a shit.</v>

31
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably be like,</v>

33
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

34
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but can't believe you're doing this on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>

35
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Some people would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did it today,</v>

36
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you said that on</v>

37
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:36.130

<v Speaker 1>It's one of the,</v>

50
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I think is the best social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

51
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

70
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>what do I do with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

71
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>One of my boys just got on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>

72
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>he just got a smartphone actually and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got</v>

73
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.440
<v Speaker 2>a smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to loop man.</v>

74
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And so he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gets on twitter and he's like,</v>

75
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 2>so what do I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well what do I say?</v>

77
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.060

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

78
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to.</v>

79
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I guess it'd be hard to gain a following</v>
<v Speaker 2>from scratch,</v>

80
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 2>like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people or you have a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you gotta say something fucked up and</v>

82
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>then someone's gonna retweet that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people start following you.</v>

83
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where,</v>

84
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>that's where trolling started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

85
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being in an audience and just trying to</v>

86
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Piss people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trolling this word weird.</v>

87
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like I wonder how many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder who has the most fake accounts.</v>

88
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Like there's gotta be some dude out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that has like a record number,</v>

89
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 2>like 150 fake accounts.</v>

90
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Just trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People I don't understand.</v>

91
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's because you're a successful</v>

92
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>man with an actual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

93
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.943
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

94
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says a lot coming from you.</v>

95
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

96
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your whole,</v>

97
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>like a Internet existence is just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>piss people off.</v>

98
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was humans like that in real</v>
<v Speaker 2>life anyway.</v>

99
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh the definitely is.</v>

100
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 2>that definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a new thing,</v>

102
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to do it without seeing the</v>

103
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 2>person and being in contact with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically to be on the other side of</v>

104
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a documentary you were on that</v>

106
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you described it beautifully about how</v>

107
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.330
<v Speaker 2>when we first got on the Internet and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that aol dial up and everybody just</v>

108
00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 2>kind of mumbling around.</v>

109
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's just kind of bumping into</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and then slowly finding a way</v>

110
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 2>to interweave it into our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a Dopa analogy that you put up.</v>

111
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a weird stage right now,</v>

112
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>or it's gonna suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

113
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 2>what's coming next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever's coming next is going to</v>

114
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>be way more invasive than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be an man probably.</v>

115
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's got some goofy glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got on check these bitches up.</v>

116
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.690

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

118
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:55.591
<v Speaker 2>look when you're filming as cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that so you can actually can</v>

119
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>actually snapchat from them.</v>

120
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Go to my phone and then I put it up like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to put all of them up and</v>

121
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

122
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

123
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 2>this is just stage one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it's going to be live all the</v>

124
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Contacts.</v>

125
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it in context.</v>

126
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>That'd be cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely gonna happen.</v>

127
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely gonna happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

128
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>when you said that shit about wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how serious were you?</v>

129
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>We have serious fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's had fucking around,</v>

130
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's like when you started thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and breaking it down,</v>

131
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I can't,</v>

132
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.600
<v Speaker 2>but everybody thinks I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay everybody,</v>

133
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 2>especially on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're posting these big ass</v>

134
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>wolves with 200 pound plus wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

135
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

136
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Like those are rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

137
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the biggest human on earth.</v>

138
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 2>And you go get me a picture of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest wolf.</v>

139
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 2>You can find some fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair.</v>

140
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Google average wolf size and I feel</v>

141
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 2>like if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>my life was dependent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to think like that.</v>

143
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want it to a wolf</v>

144
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's threatening you and you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get him,</v>

145
00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but you did so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you had something on you,</v>

146
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you'd have more of a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have sort a knife or something.</v>

147
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I wouldn't be in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 1>without something.</v>

148
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>But wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Van,</v>

149
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.340
<v Speaker 1>do you know how hard they bite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done research.</v>

151
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I've done a little research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 1200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times stronger than a pit bull.</v>

153
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 2,500.</v>

154
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 2,500 pounds per square</v>
<v Speaker 1>inch.</v>

155
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking yesterday.</v>

156
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it up a mastiff was stronger</v>

157
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>than a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is weird.</v>

158
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even top five.</v>

159
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Fucking dog alligators and crocodiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>were stronger than that.</v>

160
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>A gorilla was stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grills bites from you.</v>

161
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've never imagined herbalism.</v>

162
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating Broccoli and shit.</v>

163
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Strong branches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>they just have to fight other gorillas</v>
<v Speaker 1>for pussy because they have a one inch</v>

165
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Dick and they control a bunch of chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to have a good bite.</v>

166
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that they have it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that I know a lot of shit about girls</v>

167
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.290
<v Speaker 1>was a little tiny segment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

168
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>it's about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the females are</v>

169
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See when,</v>

170
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at like it's,</v>

171
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a truth with humans too.</v>

172
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>But testicular size and Dick size is</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly correlated to the amount of</v>

173
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous females around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

174
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're around a bunch of hoes,</v>

175
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 1>your balls get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

176
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>What is the evolutionary advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

177
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

178
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you got a sling as much dick as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these bitches are just running</v>

179
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>around with every button.</v>

180
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Women's Day,</v>

181
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.521
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

182
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

183
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

184
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thoughtless of me.</v>

185
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why chimps have big dicks and</v>

186
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:40.630
<v Speaker 1>chimps have giant balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

187
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:42.280
<v Speaker 1>See Chimp balls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never seen a chimp chipboard.</v>

188
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Pull up some chip balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a</v>

189
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>picture of this hairless chip who sit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and he has balls to just kick it</v>

190
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>back to juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Payers like to Georgia peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes balls.</v>

192
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.231
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

193
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Assize is fucking balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he's so big.</v>

194
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>He's so jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what chimps look like when you</v>

195
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 1>take the hair off of them as crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only 150 pounds.</v>

196
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>So they have a shave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This chimp?</v>

197
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has mange.</v>

198
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See all his hands.</v>

199
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got the skin condition over</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands and shit.</v>

200
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>The animals a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what need even crazier one.</v>

201
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Pull up this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

202
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Direct correlation between testicle size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brain size and chimps versus humans.</v>

203
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's a human.</v>

204
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a chimp brain on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the top and a chimp ball on the</v>

205
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the correlation?</v>

206
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have giant balls and little brains.</v>

207
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 1>If our balls were as big as our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have a fucking serious problem.</v>

208
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to walk that.</v>

209
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>We would have to figure out some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a harness.</v>

210
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my boss will be bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>though</v>

211
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>balls would be really in chimps than not</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that'd be a bigger than they are</v>

212
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what if we had smaller brains?</v>

213
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

214
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

215
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>What they think is that went with</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

217
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>especially because chimps are seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous,</v>

218
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>like there's no monogamy and the chimp</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

219
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Good for challenges.</v>

220
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for getting it everywhere.</v>

221
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>We still holding on barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

222
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>well hold it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like 50 percent divorce rate is</v>

223
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:24.090
<v Speaker 1>high man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Which means 50 percent divorce rate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the people that are not divorced,</v>

225
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>how many of those people are living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking abject misery?</v>

226
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly being beaten down by</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and not,</v>

227
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>not being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent old.</v>

228
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an old customer for sure.</v>

229
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely an old customer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an old quote from thoreau that</v>

230
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>most men live lives of quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperation.</v>

231
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's really my favorite is a Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock.</v>

232
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.651
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>he said a man is only as faithful as his</v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

234
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good quote to the,</v>

235
00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimp thing though.</v>

236
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas have figured out a way to hold</v>

237
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 1>it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like gorillas keep all those women like</v>

238
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>faithful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all female.</v>

239
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So he's a polygamous gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

240
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>well he has a bunch of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a Harem,</v>

241
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but the women don't fuck around with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other males other than him.</v>

242
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>So He's got this little dick ass and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>big balls either.</v>

243
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Gorillas are Mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

244
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Just giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

245
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So they're giant and they have giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles,</v>

246
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.310
<v Speaker 1>giant faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant jaws.</v>

247
00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>And they could kill other gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>by biting them and tearing them apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

249
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>But that's the only thing they use their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse for interested in branches and</v>

250
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Shit and leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

251
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need that strong jodie fight off</v>

252
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>all the other gorillas but a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super strong.</v>

253
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.640
<v Speaker 1>But so other grills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always interested in the,</v>

254
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the evolutionary reason as to why</v>

255
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.750
<v Speaker 1>things are the way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

256
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 1>it's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>

257
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it's their first instinct to bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

258
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours isn't.</v>

259
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I think they show their teeth more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bite,</v>

260
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show the teeth,</v>

261
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>they beat on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intimidation.</v>

262
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've seen videos of gorillas</v>

263
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.210
<v Speaker 1>beating the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

264
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one recently,</v>

265
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one at the zoo.</v>

266
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>These two girls go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like food bags.</v>

267
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a big gorilla was like about 500</v>

268
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:14.080
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

269
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>And a big one of these dudes just start</v>
<v Speaker 1>circling each other.</v>

270
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>But this is just because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

271
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Whoever built this gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to have two</v>

272
00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>silverbacks together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>So most of what they're doing is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

274
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>it's all for me to go to zoos anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

275
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a prison,</v>

276
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not depressing.</v>

277
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say this,</v>

278
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the giraffe cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those drafts don't get seen me.</v>

279
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Give a fuck was just so chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>

280
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I had had a bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you need to go so slow,</v>

281
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one's eating them.</v>

282
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>They're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they want to do is just eat</v>

283
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see a wild lines get after one</v>

284
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

285
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.180
<v Speaker 1>in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

286
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one safari or something.</v>

287
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.453
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell no.</v>

288
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I went on safari and they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw some lines out.</v>

289
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it got a Gimsburg or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

290
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but they said it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the female lions chase after this</v>

291
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>thing and then they were there right</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it took it down.</v>

292
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy nature of scary place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

293
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm surprised you think you</v>

294
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>could take a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

295
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not out here trying to hunt.</v>

296
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying in the event if I catch</v>

297
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you avid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look at like a grey wolf,</v>

298
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're small compared to me.</v>

299
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Well they just shot one of was 182</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds in Minnesota.</v>

300
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.161
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a bit.</v>

301
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gave me that picture.</v>

302
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Sizable fucking bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that was a big,</v>

303
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>big wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if like that's on this side of the</v>

304
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go towards the middle.</v>

305
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what size?</v>

306
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Like 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fuck up 100 pound thing.</v>

307
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.210
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dude man.</v>

308
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You know you can take some damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you're gonna I'm not going to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out like superman.</v>

310
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely gonna hurt.</v>

312
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I might not.</v>

313
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I might bleed out afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

314
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think you win overall.</v>

315
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>You got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you buy?</v>

316
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Like 2:30 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sends me up over here.</v>

317
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Used to seeing dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to make weight</v>

318
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.970
<v Speaker 1>70 going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

320
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>You see how you UFC or MMA fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

321
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

322
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>how hard can humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans could kick pretty hard.</v>

323
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is all I gotta do is catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>them one on the bottom and all that.</v>

324
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think I could break a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf's job with my kid.</v>

325
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to think their body gives</v>

326
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 1>better than ours does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing about people,</v>

327
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about people getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit is that people resist.</v>

328
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>They tighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>

329
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hurt.</v>

330
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude doesn't know how to fight.</v>

331
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.950
<v Speaker 1>They get stiff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked and they wanted to hurt bad,</v>

332
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 1>but as someone who's like loose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed,</v>

333
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a wolf is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about you kicking him,</v>

334
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.420
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

335
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm also an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So I have a different perspective of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in combat before that with the</v>

337
00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been in combat before.</v>

338
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Fell out and it's basically combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

340
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you have to,</v>

341
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be as a,</v>

342
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>as loose with your body as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you exert more energy,</v>

343
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>more efficient energy here than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than tensing up.</v>

344
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:21.481
<v Speaker 1>So all that's in my head and plus I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the wolf is thinking for the most</v>

345
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put up a video of a wolf</v>

346
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put it up on a regular wolf</v>

347
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.780
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

348
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>this is just a video that someone got</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently at some dude found.</v>

349
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put it up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out,</v>

350
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

351
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 1>it's posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take like three seconds</v>

352
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 1>for it to go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a video that someone just sent</v>

353
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>me and I watched it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

354
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy on a road and he saw this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf.</v>

355
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could see like,</v>

356
00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:50.550
<v Speaker 1>the headlights are on this wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Wolf Lake.</v>

357
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Just checking them out on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of wolves,</v>

358
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm not scared.</v>

359
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

360
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a life or death situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

361
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a Shitty fucking TV.</v>

362
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>When is this guy coming to fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To speed tomorrow.</v>

363
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

364
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Look at that as a big as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at him,</v>

365
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.823
<v Speaker 1>checking you out.</v>

366
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.040
<v Speaker 1>But how bold is this wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's coming near headlight.</v>

367
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.560
<v Speaker 1>So odds are he probably got his pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting though.</v>

368
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pack somewhere.</v>

369
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Unless he got kicked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have got kicked him.</v>

370
00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:30.060
<v Speaker 1>It looks like an older wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got scars all over him.</v>

371
00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be injured too.</v>

372
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably just got fucked up</v>

373
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>by one of the other walls and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>

374
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:38.680
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find my own.</v>

375
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a scary man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

376
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm pleased you think you can kill one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

377
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.751
<v Speaker 1>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

378
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I killed coyote.</v>

379
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

380
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're wrong.</v>

381
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:51.794
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

382
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foxes,</v>

383
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 1>foxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

384
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Fuck y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck a fox up.</v>

385
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.753
<v Speaker 1>Set it up.</v>

386
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.853
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

387
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to me how much,</v>

388
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have an opinion on wolves,</v>

389
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>like all of a sudden these wolf experts</v>
<v Speaker 1>come at it.</v>

390
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

391
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you kinda are though,</v>

392
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:11.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

393
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I know definitely not a wolf expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a lot about them.</v>

394
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what man I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

395
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I was on a Sitcom once and we had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimp on the set and it was a baby</v>

396
00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:23.040
<v Speaker 3>chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a two year old chimp and it had</v>

397
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 3>diapers on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a little baby and it climbed</v>

398
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm bad.</v>

399
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:30.150
<v Speaker 3>My back just slapped me a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times on the back just to play.</v>

400
00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:32.880
<v Speaker 3>It was just plan and I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

401
00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 3>how fucking hard this baby just hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

402
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 3>And I grabbed his little body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.680
<v Speaker 3>and he was being friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't being mean or anything,</v>

404
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.160
<v Speaker 3>but I grabbed his little body and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't feel anything like a person like</v>

405
00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:45.900
<v Speaker 3>you grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even a strong person.</v>

406
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a little give to their</v>
<v Speaker 3>arms.</v>

407
00:16:48.301 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 3>She looked even though like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>power lifter dude like the mountain from</v>

408
00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:52.194
<v Speaker 3>game of thrones.</v>

409
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if that dude was just resting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you grabbed his arm,</v>

410
00:16:55.651 --> 00:16:59.760
<v Speaker 3>this is a little bit of give to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>with chimps that like courted steel man.</v>

411
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.080
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does not.</v>

412
00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:04.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why a 150 pound chip is a strong</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a 500 pound man.</v>

413
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.390
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're grabbing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

414
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Like literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was confusing to me and then I</v>

415
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.110
<v Speaker 3>was thinking in my head like I just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in my head that that thing is like,</v>

416
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I would scale it down like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but person was that big,</v>

417
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.680
<v Speaker 3>a person wouldn't be this strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you touch it you realize</v>

418
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that is not composed at the same shit a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person</v>

419
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and do other things though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

420
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

421
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.790
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they swing around on trees and those,</v>

422
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.200
<v Speaker 1>those muscles develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

423
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't compare a human size chimp?</v>

424
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.700
<v Speaker 1>No you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you can't.</v>

425
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you see that hairless</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and you see how jack has a different</v>

426
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and plus they got thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like they,</v>

427
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.790
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how big a chimp you think,</v>

428
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.380
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could fucking champ up</v>

429
00:17:47.381 --> 00:17:48.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep Champs.</v>

430
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the one that you</v>

431
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 2>fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't know it.</v>

432
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

433
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty realistic.</v>

434
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Then we say what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pretty realistic then.</v>

435
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think in like a kick to the face.</v>

436
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the opening move with the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To be God to be and he don't know</v>

437
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:07.370
<v Speaker 2>what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't go was coming,</v>

438
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.830
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to leap towards your</v>
<v Speaker 2>throat and I'm going to leap towards</v>

439
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you got to have that</v>

440
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>mentality and somebody sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent me an article to write in</v>

441
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some woman,</v>

442
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survived the wolf attacked and killed</v>

443
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:21.350
<v Speaker 2>the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

444
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

445
00:18:22.721 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read past she see.</v>

446
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>But that goes back to the whole chimp</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because the Russians are built</v>

447
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.150
<v Speaker 2>different than regular white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel you.</v>

449
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.770

<v Speaker 2>I just feel like saying,</v>

450
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

451
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.320

<v Speaker 2>got to beat this wolf.</v>

452
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:41.154
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well those Dagestan people are hard as</v>

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 2>What doctor did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should find out.</v>

466
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 2>What doctor did that as a dude that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a dude.</v>

467
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.880
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a not real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like physically.</v>

468
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the help of plastic surgery.</v>

469
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even.</v>

470
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear this talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

471
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the world we live in today,</v>

472
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing you'd have going for you is</v>

473
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 2>that a wolf doesn't really want to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the death.</v>

474
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.060
<v Speaker 2>They just want to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

475
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can't kill you,</v>

476
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 2>they might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

477
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Fuck Outta here.</v>

478
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 2>They said that about like mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions.</v>

479
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need them.</v>

480
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say one either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you get attacked,</v>

481
00:19:54.521 --> 00:19:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a because um,</v>

482
00:19:57.291 --> 00:20:00.120
<v Speaker 2>my girl right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she from the northwest area and we went</v>

483
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 2>on this little hike once and so she told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me while we were there,</v>

484
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh they have mountain lions.</v>

485
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 2>They had little packets on how to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with if you see a mountain.</v>

486
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd have told me that there was</v>

487
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not have king.</v>

488
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm reading the pamphlet and they say</v>

489
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:20.350
<v Speaker 2>if you get big they usually like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it back off their kids here.</v>

490
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Throw your arms up in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

491
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They say if you have a kid with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you supposed to pick your kid up and</v>

492
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:26.500
<v Speaker 2>hold it over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

493
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

494
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people have killed mountain lions</v>

495
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 2>before with knives and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a knife and get attack by,</v>

496
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.470
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

497
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that's all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this possible?</v>

498
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Well you definitely definitely have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

499
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.590
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a wolf to just eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he had that mentality dog,</v>

500
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you just have to like mentality.</v>

501
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.790
<v Speaker 2>He has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like you,</v>

502
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I come from like the mode of like</v>

503
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it's either hit or be hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill or be killed,</v>

504
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:57.270
<v Speaker 2>like people out here trying to break my</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>

505
00:20:57.271 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So like you have to have kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotic mentality.</v>

506
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Well you definitely do to play nfl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

507
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Just no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're staring down a team</v>

508
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 2>of super athletes and you're just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to collide with each other and try to</v>

509
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 2>get across lines and just a totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>different way of living.</v>

510
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Your life's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That 99 percent of the world.</v>

511
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I tell people that like I've had 14</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeries in my career.</v>

512
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's normal to me.</v>

513
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's been one of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>play in the league like after the</v>

514
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like usually everybody gets a Sergio of</v>

515
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.960
<v Speaker 2>something that that's been.</v>

516
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>What have you had done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a meniscus several times.</v>

517
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I've had Achilles back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

518
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.100
<v Speaker 2>my pinky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder actually played,</v>

519
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

520
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 2>all of my 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 season with a broken collarbone.</v>

521
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Jesus did that game three and it's still</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>

522
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 2>You can still feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with a broken collarbone.</v>

523
00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you do that mind over matter man?</v>

524
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Is it like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

525
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Because at that time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went undrafted,</v>

526
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

527
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I had just got my shot to start and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was game three and I was having a really</v>

528
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 2>good season and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was either like if in the NFL,</v>

529
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're not already paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>

530
00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your position is up for grabs.</v>

531
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And so it's either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either you,</v>

532
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>you push through it or somebody's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your spot.</v>

533
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 2>And so at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my,</v>

534
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 2>that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my time to shine.</v>

535
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.463
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shh,</v>

536
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 2>painkillers man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So could you feel it moving around?</v>

537
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How had to protect it.</v>

538
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 2>My brother in law has like a metal piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

539
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 2>He lost his and BMX accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put like a titanium rod.</v>

540
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I think I need that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like right now it's dipped in.</v>

541
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:32.380
<v Speaker 2>You can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like dipped in.</v>

542
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever like get it looked at a na</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] cause I didn't want them to</v>

543
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:38.770
<v Speaker 2>know I was hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because they bring that,</v>

544
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they bring that shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during when you're negotiating your</v>

545
00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:41.321
<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

546
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he missed this because he was</v>

547
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Speaker 2>hurting and they bring that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use it as leverage against you.</v>

548
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And so 2012 was when I signed my</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract the day after I was like,</v>

549
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let y'all know I broke my</v>
<v Speaker 2>collarbone two years ago and was like,</v>

550
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:51.910
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

551
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

552
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:53.580
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

553
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.413
<v Speaker 2>get an x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y.</v>

554
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 2>and so we got an extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

555
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

556
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I would be impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's the guy I want on my</v>

557
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:01.294
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

558
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Played with a broken collarbone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bittersweet.</v>

559
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

560
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you tell them that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>

561
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.301
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

562
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:08.930
<v Speaker 2>well he gets injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a,</v>

563
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is human?</v>

564
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck doesn't get injured playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the NFL?</v>

565
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think that's a rational way to</v>

566
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:16.571
<v Speaker 2>go about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

567
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's played pro football didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get injured.</v>

568
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's it impossible?</v>

569
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anybody.</v>

570
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I watched the super bowl and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things I was thinking it was like,</v>

571
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching all these dudes run and</v>

572
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 2>collide with each other and watching all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tackles.</v>

573
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And like I was trying to stockpile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

574
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.220
<v Speaker 2>in my head I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many injuries in my watch in here?</v>

575
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

576
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of times dudes will walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and then later that night they be</v>

577
00:23:42.491 --> 00:23:43.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

578
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:45.110
<v Speaker 2>my fucking back is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

579
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the word.</v>

580
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And then you get it diagnosed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of a bulging disc or</v>

581
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:49.390
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

582
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.270
<v Speaker 2>The problem I had because most of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that,</v>

583
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.180
<v Speaker 2>that kept me off the field with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft tissue injuries,</v>

584
00:23:55.181 --> 00:23:56.560
<v Speaker 2>which you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't run with,</v>

585
00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my hamstring won't get.</v>

586
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.570
<v Speaker 2>But like all the rest of my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

587
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.870
<v Speaker 2>my problem became like my pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my tolerance for pain,</v>

588
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.040
<v Speaker 2>my threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became so high that like,</v>

589
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what hurt and what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal anymore.</v>

590
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:10.690
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still kind of dealing with a lot of</v>

591
00:24:10.691 --> 00:24:13.990
<v Speaker 2>those aches and pains and stuff now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you just push through it</v>

592
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>because the pain was normal and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get accustomed to it.</v>

593
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>

594
00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Pain becomes a part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

595
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you always know that,</v>

596
00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 3>like when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

597
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you played in high school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you played college,</v>

598
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.610
<v Speaker 3>did you always know that this was</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually going to lead to like a point</v>

599
00:24:30.611 --> 00:24:32.320
<v Speaker 3>where your body just wasn't gonna be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do it anymore?</v>

600
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you think about that</v>

601
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that,</v>

602
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.413
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

603
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.040
<v Speaker 2>and people tell you about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

604
00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:42.270
<v Speaker 2>they say ignorance is bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't know it's,</v>

605
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually affects you until it</v>

606
00:24:44.351 --> 00:24:46.270
<v Speaker 2>actually affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>

607
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.430
<v Speaker 2>you're like one of the worst games I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been a part of what we were paying</v>

608
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Chicago and 2012 I thing and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>raining so they just run into the whole</v>

609
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:59.470
<v Speaker 2>game and the next day I woke up like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>limping,</v>

610
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>like walking towards the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't.</v>

611
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It took me about five minutes in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom is like right there,</v>

612
00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:05.410
<v Speaker 2>so I took like five minutes and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

613
00:25:05.411 --> 00:25:06.130
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like limping.</v>

614
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body was just beat up most of</v>

615
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:12.160
<v Speaker 2>painkillers as well from the game and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you go,</v>

616
00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:13.900
<v Speaker 2>when you're going through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really realize it,</v>

617
00:25:13.901 --> 00:25:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but like towards the end of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

618
00:25:15.941 --> 00:25:17.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of why I decided to walk</v>

619
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:18.930
<v Speaker 2>away because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

620
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.350
<v Speaker 2>is it worth it anymore?</v>

621
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:21.880
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm relatively healthy.</v>

622
00:25:21.881 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I could walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could walk,</v>

623
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

624
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.530
<v Speaker 2>who knows what I've done to my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:28.630
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the onset of that comes on years</v>

626
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.810
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after awhile it was just,</v>

627
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it just stopped being worth it to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

628
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.570
<v Speaker 2>And plus I kind of just fell out of love</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

629
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird place to be right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

630
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying like you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with your brain,</v>

631
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.360
<v Speaker 2>do you notice anything now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

632
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Nothing that I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

633
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've definitely had concussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>before and,</v>

634
00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:52.060
<v Speaker 2>and earlier on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the cte stuff kind of,</v>

635
00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like the product 2000,</v>

636
00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.540
<v Speaker 2>1314 is when the science really started</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the news media really started talking</v>

637
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:04.360
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but growing up like it was kind of just</v>

638
00:26:04.361 --> 00:26:06.940
<v Speaker 2>caught a dinger like he's got done and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying you got dinged and no</v>

639
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:09.340
<v Speaker 2>one worried about the consequences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we didn't really know.</v>

640
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just part of part of it.</v>

641
00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely had concussions before</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>

642
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.420
<v Speaker 2>not really sure where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like somehow your subconscious knows</v>

643
00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:21.430
<v Speaker 2>what to do when you play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

644
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 2>that's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're out of it because you've got</v>

645
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:26.510
<v Speaker 2>cracked and you just kind of gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the game anyway.</v>

646
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Keep playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember it afterwards?</v>

647
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 2>A parts parts that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fighters,</v>

648
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.470
<v Speaker 2>like they'll get dropped in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

649
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:37.200
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there'll be on their corner and</v>

650
00:26:37.201 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 2>the like the fourth round headed into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifth and they'll think it's the</v>

651
00:26:40.781 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 2>second round two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the coach go,</v>

652
00:26:42.881 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 2>hey you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fought three more rounds and you</v>

653
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:45.961
<v Speaker 2>think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

654
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

655
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

656
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

657
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to me that people are able</v>

658
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:58.170
<v Speaker 2>to function on such a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really conscious of what's going on.</v>

659
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be your training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

660
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all training is you're training</v>

661
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 2>your body to become second nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when you were in high school and</v>

662
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:08.220
<v Speaker 2>you were in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there any talk at all about brain</v>

663
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 2>damage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any talk about cte or the.</v>

664
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody worried about it now.</v>

665
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:15.360
<v Speaker 2>It was just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

666
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 2>The science wasn't complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure there were,</v>

667
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>there were neuroscientist saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain damage is real,</v>

668
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but the science wasn't as definitive as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is now,</v>

669
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 2>but no one connected it the way they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>with boxing.</v>

670
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to us.</v>

671
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

672
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

673
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 2>like now people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are worrisome about putting the kids in</v>

674
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 2>youth leagues and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're even talking about not</v>

675
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.690
<v Speaker 2>letting youth leagues happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have tackle football at all,</v>

676
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:44.670
<v Speaker 2>which I'm an advocate for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a,</v>

677
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>there's no point for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

678
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 2>my kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son did not gonna play football.</v>

679
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.363
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

680
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

681
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made it my body.</v>

682
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they could have a free ride or</v>

683
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

684
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 2>What if they want to play football?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say sit down,</v>

685
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta trust my man.</v>

686
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.353
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

687
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.450
<v Speaker 2>They want to be their own man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

688
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to physically stop him.</v>

689
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably could,</v>

690
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

691
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

692
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I would seriously sit them down and let</v>
<v Speaker 2>them know the consequences,</v>

693
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.660
<v Speaker 2>showing people and show them the risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>factors involved.</v>

694
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Like it is not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you want to enter and I mean,</v>

695
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.020
<v Speaker 2>as much as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

696
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 2>as a son wants to walk into his father's</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>

697
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not worth it,</v>

698
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.290
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really nice and you're probably not</v>

699
00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 2>going to be as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how.</v>

700
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 2>What if you kid wanting to fight like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like box?</v>

701
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Box or boxer.</v>

702
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't advocate that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't let them do that.</v>

703
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm pushing them to go towards like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

704
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I want them to be scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had to do it over again,</v>

705
00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't never played football.</v>

706
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.491
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

707
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even.</v>

708
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You would start from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you could go back to college and</v>

709
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.410
<v Speaker 2>knowing what you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

710
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Not even close and just because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage to your body will that.</v>

711
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:03.640
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

712
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

713
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.104
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

714
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you're in your prime physically as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a man,</v>

715
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in your infancy mentally.</v>

716
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

717
00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 2>And so like I'm just now figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I am and what kind of man I want to</v>

718
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:18.294
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

719
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

720
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 2>while you're in your prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're in the public eye.</v>

721
00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:24.950
<v Speaker 2>So you have to deal with all of that on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of figures.</v>

722
00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 2>So you're figuring out who you are in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishbowl.</v>

723
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really weird,</v>

724
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.110
<v Speaker 2>really weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't even want to deal like,</v>

725
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 2>like any kind of recommendation or any</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of</v>

726
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.180
<v Speaker 2>fame or whatever people want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

727
00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

728
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the best to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>

729
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society would be a artist and a</v>

730
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a ideal society to me.</v>

731
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.500
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting take on things.</v>

732
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Considering how successful you've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing football,</v>

733
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 4>playing football obviously was very</v>
<v Speaker 4>financially rewarding to you.</v>

734
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Made you famous for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if just some regular dude went on</v>

735
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.450
<v Speaker 4>twitter and start talking about I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a wolf farmer.</v>

736
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I know that he killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody will care and be like,</v>

737
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.660
<v Speaker 4>shut up stupid that anybody cares</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

738
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 4>but it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking my twitter.</v>

739
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 4>But I said you were coming to school and</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to kill.</v>

740
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.853
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>

741
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

742
00:30:28.401 --> 00:30:30.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

743
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.600
<v Speaker 2>once you get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that financial summit that um,</v>

744
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.630
<v Speaker 2>everybody strives for that American</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

745
00:30:35.631 --> 00:30:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You realize that there is no there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ain't happy with $10,</v>

746
00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be happy with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

747
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

748
00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:45.020
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some things that you need,</v>

749
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you need monetary</v>
<v Speaker 2>value in the society to,</v>

750
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.980
<v Speaker 2>to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they did a study.</v>

751
00:30:51.981 --> 00:30:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like after $75,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money can't buy happiness like so</v>

752
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.760
<v Speaker 2>everything else out there is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just luxury and really if you put</v>

753
00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 2>it in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like 35 percent.</v>

754
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

755
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.570
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make $35,000 a year,</v>

756
00:31:05.571 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you're in the top one percent of wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

757
00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

758
00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:12.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about perspective man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once,</v>

759
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.943
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I.</v>

760
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.480
<v Speaker 2>It took me to get to that financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>summit to understand that unfortunately.</v>

761
00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:20.810
<v Speaker 2>But the weird thing about it is once you</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people that and you're on top of</v>

762
00:31:20.811 --> 00:31:23.360
<v Speaker 2>this financial summit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's for you to say,</v>

763
00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:24.194
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

764
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.500
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

765
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy for you to know.</v>

766
00:31:26.991 --> 00:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>A lot of miserable millionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

767
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.550
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting that you said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like growing up and figuring out</v>

768
00:31:34.551 --> 00:31:39.470
<v Speaker 4>who you are while you're in a fishbowl</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you were also involved in not just</v>

769
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.910
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just in a fishbowl,</v>

770
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.790
<v Speaker 4>you're involved in like this competitive</v>
<v Speaker 4>fishbowl where you're,</v>

771
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:44.960
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

772
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.640
<v Speaker 4>your value is being judged by your</v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to cover distance and speed,</v>

773
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.570
<v Speaker 4>but your ability to score points or it</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped people from scoring points.</v>

774
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.040
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of crazy too.</v>

775
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

776
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.400
<v Speaker 2>football is not a place for a like</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers and I'm not,</v>

777
00:32:01.401 --> 00:32:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that I'm the only person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has these thoughts,</v>

778
00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:06.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like questioning authority and</v>

779
00:32:06.261 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you're questioning a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like football is not the place for you</v>

780
00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:10.790
<v Speaker 2>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're inquisitive at all,</v>

781
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:15.260
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of comes off as arrogant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes off as I'm like disruptive.</v>

782
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 2>And I never was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

783
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I was always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do we do things this way?</v>

784
00:32:19.431 --> 00:32:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

785
00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Like especially like in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

786
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:25.820
<v Speaker 2>So like football has this like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

787
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.090
<v Speaker 2>relationship with coach to player that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can talk to other men,</v>

788
00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:34.520
<v Speaker 2>like you can treat them like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the coach,</v>

789
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.520
<v Speaker 2>the coach can yell at the player you</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of Shit,</v>

790
00:32:37.521 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I use,</v>

791
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 2>if he was working at home depot and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss comes to upc shit,</v>

792
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you didn't stock that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buys the,</v>

793
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like you'd be calling hr rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying basis or weird for some reason in</v>

794
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 2>that arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

795
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 2>And like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

796
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:53.680
<v Speaker 2>if you want me to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I used to tell my coach was like,</v>

797
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 2>don't yell at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no reason for you yet</v>

798
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.600
<v Speaker 2>because like one on one I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

799
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Easier than a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

800
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.383
<v Speaker 4>Man</v>

801
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 2>didn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>

802
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 2>why on this field is it okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as we walk out to the field</v>

803
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't,</v>

804
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't dare yelled at me like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

805
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Why is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus you got a hot head coming out</v>

806
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.530
<v Speaker 2>of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

807
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in a lot of us are because I</v>

808
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.120
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you usually come from those</v>

809
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.153
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods were,</v>

810
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.840
<v Speaker 4>do you think that's just because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to control these big groups of</v>

811
00:33:22.841 --> 00:33:26.380
<v Speaker 4>super athletes so they have to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>posture and like yelling at him,</v>

812
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 4>like you would yell at like a guard dog</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

813
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920
<v Speaker 2>His cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

814
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So you just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to.</v>

815
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It was just that same old mechanism of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

816
00:33:33.781 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>

817
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 2>people ruled by fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wrote the biggest stick.</v>

818
00:33:37.351 --> 00:33:38.130
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

819
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.560
<v Speaker 2>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how humans have done it for</v>

820
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.670
<v Speaker 2>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they get into your head about</v>

821
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.560
<v Speaker 2>who this leverage of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have fear,</v>

822
00:33:46.561 --> 00:33:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I have your scholarship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this,</v>

823
00:33:48.091 --> 00:33:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do what I say,</v>

824
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.950
<v Speaker 2>all that gets taken away and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me it did it.</v>

825
00:33:52.951 --> 00:33:53.784
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

826
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm in because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

827
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you're labeled as like a trouble there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

828
00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:02.970
<v Speaker 2>like I was part of the reason why I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get drafted.</v>

829
00:34:02.971 --> 00:34:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I found out like the coaches said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

830
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

831
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't coachable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

832
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

833
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 4>like getting yelled at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

834
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 4>that's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's seen that before.</v>

835
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 4>I've seen coaches screaming at athletes</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could kill them and you don't see</v>

836
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:20.361
<v Speaker 4>that in others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

837
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:25.361
<v Speaker 4>you definitely don't see that in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mma also like the coach relationship</v>

838
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 4>with the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a father son relationship and a lot</v>

839
00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 4>of ways they're like brothers or at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>very least family,</v>

840
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like an intense bond.</v>

841
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying every coach is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

842
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.361
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

843
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:40.220
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

844
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.910
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely a coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's changing and like</v>

845
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 4>with this whole kaepernick thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are sort of aware of people being</v>

846
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:51.161
<v Speaker 4>more socially conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more aware of people using their,</v>

847
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

848
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 4>their fame for a platform to voice their</v>
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>

849
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 4>their opinions on certain social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

850
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.220
<v Speaker 4>is that changing?</v>

851
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>He has to because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well social media is just changing</v>

852
00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:05.220
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's changing the way we think.</v>

853
00:35:05.221 --> 00:35:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It's changing the way situations are</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitored because it's like a,</v>

854
00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:10.710
<v Speaker 2>there's a camera with you everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

855
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

856
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

857
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.490
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bigger sense,</v>

858
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes in general are becoming more</v>

859
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:20.970
<v Speaker 2>outspoken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Athletes are becoming a more well</v>

860
00:35:20.971 --> 00:35:22.420
<v Speaker 2>versed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

861
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.100
<v Speaker 2>they're really understanding their brand</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and with that,</v>

862
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to change the way things have</v>

863
00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:31.230
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have been done in the past,</v>

864
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a simple stuff like training camp,</v>

865
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 2>training camp used to be two days full</v>
<v Speaker 2>pads and you're hitting at a time,</v>

866
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes are getting bigger,</v>

867
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:41.701
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

868
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 2>So if you want your catalog last long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to take care of them when</v>

869
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 2>you're practicing cattles that just talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

870
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:49.400
<v Speaker 2>So it disturbs the truth though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

871
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's disturbing.</v>

872
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 2>We get compensated heavily in the NFL or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NCAA.</v>

873
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Is this a whole nother conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

874
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 2>those crooks don't pay their employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as the NFL,</v>

875
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 2>you get compensated and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

876
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 2>the risks for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 2>the risks going into the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I chose to do this as a at a young</v>

878
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

879
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those crooks don't pay their employees.</v>

880
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Get out as a dark and dirty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

881
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 1>College sports hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

882
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I hate it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything to do with it,</v>

883
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but I watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

884
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:21.560
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out how much those fucking</v>

885
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>schools get from all those people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make sure that their team is</v>

886
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 1>successful because the alma maters wanna</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

887
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.390
<v Speaker 1>We fucking won again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did.</v>

888
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.850
<v Speaker 1>They get billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are fucking huge,</v>

889
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 1>huge business man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the athletes don't get paid</v>

890
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.540
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

891
00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:37.374
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

892
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I've told many many times I've told my</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of that story,</v>

893
00:36:40.841 --> 00:36:42.520
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

894
00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of the NCA.</v>

895
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan either.</v>

896
00:36:45.011 --> 00:36:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're stealing from those</v>

897
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 1>athletes and ruining their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely for you.</v>

898
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.550
<v Speaker 1>If you do four hard years of college</v>
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

899
00:36:54.551 --> 00:36:57.280
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that without a permanent injury?</v>

900
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think three or four of my surgeries</v>

901
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.260
<v Speaker 1>came from college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

902
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's playing for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay for and my buddy,</v>

903
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.150
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an education.</v>

904
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that kills me when</v>

905
00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:12.440
<v Speaker 1>people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that I hate that.</v>

906
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.490
<v Speaker 2>So when I first went to school I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study astronomy.</v>

907
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what I wanted to study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my academic advisor and I</v>

908
00:37:19.631 --> 00:37:20.111
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

909
00:37:20.111 --> 00:37:22.240
<v Speaker 2>this is what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it took me a year to figure out,</v>

910
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:22.961
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>

911
00:37:22.961 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in love with the stars in the</v>

912
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.151
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the,</v>

913
00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:27.820
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to know about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as I said,</v>

914
00:37:27.821 --> 00:37:28.121
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

915
00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:28.901
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

916
00:37:28.901 --> 00:37:29.680
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

917
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.650
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those classes conflict with the practice</v>

918
00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:34.210
<v Speaker 2>schedules in the meeting schedules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

919
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:36.460
<v Speaker 2>well shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to wait another year in</v>

920
00:37:36.461 --> 00:37:40.180
<v Speaker 2>order to find what I wanted to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up settling for a philosophy,</v>

921
00:37:40.181 --> 00:37:42.520
<v Speaker 2>which was a cool major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't,</v>

922
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 2>it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like if,</v>

923
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:46.540
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would've got influenced by,</v>

924
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.810
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

925
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.980
<v Speaker 2>astronomy early on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it would have changed my trajectory</v>

926
00:37:50.981 --> 00:37:53.350
<v Speaker 2>would have changed the way I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a lot or I'd arrived to the</v>

927
00:37:53.351 --> 00:37:55.060
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that I met now a lot sooner.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>three week period where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they leave you alone and you're just</v>

938
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:23.690
<v Speaker 2>like a regular student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did not know what to do with my</v>

939

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 2>how are these people not ace in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes?</v>

942
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't understand like how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

943
00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:34.040
<v Speaker 2>granted they were taking courses but</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like you have so much time.</v>

944
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do with my time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it before.</v>

945
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Whereas before I'm up early in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

946
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

947
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 2>then go into class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then after class get a little lunch,</v>

948
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:44.160
<v Speaker 2>then go to another class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you come back in,</v>

949
00:38:44.161 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you're in meetings and after meetings</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to practice and after practice</v>

950
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:49.380
<v Speaker 2>you get find some kind of energy study</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

951
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Well give me a rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what time of morning would you</v>

952
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 2>get up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you were in school?</v>

953
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Usually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually I had some of the most.</v>

954
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Most of my classes were the 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes,</v>

955
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.120
<v Speaker 2>so 8:00 AM you're up now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I up before that.</v>

956
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so independent on the day.</v>

957
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 2>So you have to get a workout in</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on everybody.</v>

958
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Every strength coach has a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol so you have to lift at least</v>

959
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.240
<v Speaker 2>three times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

960
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 2>three to two to three times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you either lift before class or</v>

961
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:17.320
<v Speaker 2>before practice or after practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to,</v>

962
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you have to find your time with after</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice you got to be hard,</v>

963
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:21.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

964
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:22.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

965
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Then you're just kinda going through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motion so.</v>

966
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>But do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to do it before practice</v>

967
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 2>because then you might be tired when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into practice,</v>

968
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you might not perform up to the best of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your abilities.</v>

969
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

970
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not the best at that.</v>

971
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I used to get in trouble a lot because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

972
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.020
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you guys can expect me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do all of this shit.</v>

973
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I used to get in trouble for skipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights</v>

974
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't big on weight to anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

975
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that because we had a lot</v>

976
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 2>of Olympic weight lifting and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of changing too.</v>

977
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of like dead lifts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats and shit like that.</v>

978
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And I was never a fan of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

979
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>this is not a conducive to being</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

980
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.600
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is Plyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plyo?</v>

981
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yoga,</v>

982
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga would real.</v>

983
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had a yoga,</v>

984
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd have been there every time because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're,</v>

985
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you're getting loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any kind of you being limber is more</v>

986
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:11.020
<v Speaker 2>important to me and strong in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>

987
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 2>especially in my position.</v>

988
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>And my position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's something,</v>

989
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 2>there are some positions like d linemen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and office alignment where you gotta you</v>

990
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:20.050
<v Speaker 2>gotTa Push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not one of those because I</v>

991
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 2>wasn't one of those positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a running back as like dbs</v>

992
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 2>receivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like stay limber,</v>

993
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 2>stay hydrated with good nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for you it's more important to be</v>

994
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 2>flexible and to be able to move your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body in very fluid ways.</v>

995
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So to be able to avoid take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will avoid somebody trying to</v>

996
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 2>tackle you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

997
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you more pliable is better in my</v>

998
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:41.194
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

999
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.420
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting way of looking at</v>

1000
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would uh,</v>

1001
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 2>they would force you to do certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of lifts.</v>

1002
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do a certain amount of lifts</v>

1003
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you got to go to class and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to stay up and then when you're</v>

1004
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>doing these lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they supervised or you have to do</v>

1005
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 2>coaches in there.</v>

1006
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's another thing that bothers me</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1007
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like a rebel man because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will follow you around the weight</v>

1008
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:02.070
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1009
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Because some guys liked to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 2>try to try to jerk the system and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1011
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I want to do with my life.</v>

1012
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not going to cheat myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like stop following me around.</v>

1013
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't long.</v>

1014
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a weird.</v>

1015
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they have class checkers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow you make sure you go to class</v>

1016
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.090
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1017
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.830

1019
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And so like after a while that just wore</v>
<v Speaker 2>on me and like the whole system wore on</v>

1020
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 2>me and on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm hungry.</v>

1021
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.580

<v Speaker 2>You don't get the food out.</v>

1022

<v Speaker 2>you would have to figure out when</v>

1038
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would you schedule your lifts and</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever suits your schedule the best.</v>

1041
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you have an 8:00 class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to go before class or whenever</v>

1042
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 2>your break is during.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many classes are you doing today?</v>

1043
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Like two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what?</v>

1044
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to keep a certain GPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two point five.</v>

1045
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 2>So you have to keep up to par.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1046
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Like a c average and just like see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see averages.</v>

1047
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.170
<v Speaker 2>So you would go to your class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do whatever you gotta do.</v>

1048
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 2>And then how many times a day are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing?</v>

1049
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 2>A once a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have meetings,</v>

1050
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 2>meetings are like an hour 30 and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings are essential or going over</v>

1051
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 2>strategy and go here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get your playbook,</v>

1052
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>your game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch film on the other team or</v>

1053
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:54.230
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it hard to motivate yourself watching</v>

1054
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:55.250
<v Speaker 2>all that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1055
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:58.190
<v Speaker 2>after awhile for me because like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my quarterbacks are different.</v>

1056
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exert as much physical energy as we do</v>

1057
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more on a mental game so they</v>

1058
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:10.370
<v Speaker 2>have to know the defensive games that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the defensive coordinators playing.</v>

1059
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what covers then wider,</v>

1060
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 2>what the safety is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to know that as a running</v>

1061
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:17.720
<v Speaker 2>back you kind of have to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not as much.</v>

1062
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:20.060
<v Speaker 2>You kind of just have to know where</v>
<v Speaker 2>their blitzes are coming from.</v>

1063
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.163
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the,</v>

1064
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 2>with the intricacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1065
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 2>after awhile I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need to watch much film in</v>

1066
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 2>order me to get my assignment done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of times I'm just sitting there</v>

1067
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 2>wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like that too.</v>

1068
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine sitting there watching</v>

1069
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:36.620
<v Speaker 2>some stupid place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always told my coaches,</v>

1070
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 2>especially in the league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1071
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you could give me my game plan like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday before the game and I'll</v>

1072
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 2>execute it like I didn't need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of what they do and the</v>

1073
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 2>NFL is just reinforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just over and over and it's</v>

1074
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 2>repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition,</v>

1075
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a veteran,</v>

1076
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I get on there.</v>

1077
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why Brett Farve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he was deciding on whether to</v>

1078
00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 2>come back or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like I,</v>

1079
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all that other shit.</v>

1080
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't like doing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The meetings and that kept him back</v>

1081
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.201
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1082
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 2>He really just gets old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets super old man and you don't know</v>

1083
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:12.030
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and you and you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1084
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well versed in your craft.</v>

1085
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't you don't need half of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is terrible for the younger</v>

1086
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:21.560
<v Speaker 2>cats that are listening to this man was</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about a guy like Brett farve</v>

1087
00:44:21.561 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all that fucking gray hair or</v>

1088
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.580
<v Speaker 2>grizzled old veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a goat milk still wanting to do it.</v>

1089
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1090
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still wanted to do it.</v>

1091
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times I've been deemed as was</v>

1092
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1093
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.880
<v Speaker 2>get hit a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1094
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 2>like get enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1095
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Jim Mcmahon is all fucked up now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most ex players are.</v>

1096
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most experts are.</v>

1097
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.470
<v Speaker 4>I was reading that sports illustrated</v>
<v Speaker 4>article about Mcmahon and they did an</v>

1098
00:44:50.471 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 4>interview on one of those sports radio</v>
<v Speaker 4>stations.</v>

1099
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was disturbing and it was talking</v>

1100
00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:58.450
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll be like somewhere and you just</v>

1101
00:44:58.451 --> 00:45:00.930
<v Speaker 4>totally forgot how he got there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he's going,</v>

1102
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.440
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't have my keys in my hand?</v>

1103
00:45:02.441 --> 00:45:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Where am I going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the unfortunate part of the</v>

1105
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.420
<v Speaker 4>prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they would follow you around.</v>

1106
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.130
<v Speaker 4>They'd make sure you go to classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1107
00:45:12.131 --> 00:45:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Some dude with a clipboard.</v>

1108
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extra foster.</v>

1109
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Some ga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they will say anything though,</v>

1110
00:45:17.241 --> 00:45:18.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone say anything?</v>

1111
00:45:18.521 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 2>So like they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would send them and they would</v>

1112
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:23.830
<v Speaker 2>check and see if you're in there and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in there they report back to</v>

1113
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.120
<v Speaker 2>coach and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh he missed on.</v>

1114
00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:26.470
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ANd then you gotta go up to the coaches.</v>

1115
00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:26.891
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1116
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:27.790
<v Speaker 2>why weren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1117
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.480
<v Speaker 2>the crazy shit is in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you kind of learn how to</v>

1118
00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:34.690
<v Speaker 2>time management as that's where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn your time management as,</v>

1119
00:45:34.691 --> 00:45:35.590
<v Speaker 2>as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1120
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.440
<v Speaker 2>So they don't even allow you to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>an adult.</v>

1121
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.020
<v Speaker 2>How most adults become adult in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>college system.</v>

1122
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 2>So like some teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some professors will give you a syllabus</v>

1123
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1124
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.960
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's going to be the work for it and</v>

1125
00:45:46.961 --> 00:45:49.240
<v Speaker 2>show up when you want to show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're responsible for your own</v>

1126
00:45:49.241 --> 00:45:51.250
<v Speaker 2>information at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the most part,</v>

1127
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't even get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1128
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that luxury you have to go every single</v>

1129
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.620
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

1130
00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.311
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every class.</v>

1131
00:45:57.311 --> 00:45:58.780
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even,</v>

1132
00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.790
<v Speaker 2>students aren't even required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I required?</v>

1133
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could study at home.</v>

1134
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.230
<v Speaker 4>You want it to maybe even learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was really good.</v>

1135
00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Beginning of like online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like syllabus is online stuff.</v>

1136
00:46:10.241 --> 00:46:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So like I'm not sure if maybe maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges have adjusted that to that</v>

1137
00:46:14.141 --> 00:46:15.340
<v Speaker 2>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from when I was,</v>

1138
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.440
<v Speaker 2>when I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1139
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.350
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made,</v>

1140
00:46:17.351 --> 00:46:18.880
<v Speaker 2>it was mandated you have to go to every</v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

1141
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Well it seems like you're preparing for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a career in professional sports,</v>

1142
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 4>but you're also pretending that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting like a real education,</v>

1143
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.410
<v Speaker 4>like a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.800
<v Speaker 4>But it is kind of pretending because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a way you could be preparing</v>

1145
00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:39.260
<v Speaker 4>for like high level college athletics</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have the same time to devote towards</v>

1146
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 4>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

1147
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's why like that's why I say I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1149
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I would do it again if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to do it again,</v>

1150
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I would do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wouldn't go football at all</v>

1151
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like the shit that keeps you</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at night now it's not football.</v>

1152
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I knew I was tying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1153
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sitting on the sidelines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about other shit.</v>

1154
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of show a physics like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really up at nightmare.</v>

1155
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.670
<v Speaker 2>It keeps me up at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of physics?</v>

1156
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Theoretical physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what got me into it was relativity.</v>

1157
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what hookeD me,</v>

1158
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:14.090
<v Speaker 2>like einstein equals mc squared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of just fascinated by the</v>

1159
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:15.470
<v Speaker 2>concept of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1160
00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how anybody isn't man,</v>

1161
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.240
<v Speaker 2>like it's the whole store really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you still.</v>

1162
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.580
<v Speaker 2>So relativity brought me in and how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened was one day I was,</v>

1163
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I was actually hired man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was smoking weed crazy here and it</v>

1164
00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:33.640
<v Speaker 2>kinda hit me because like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about what einstein did but you</v>

1165
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 2>don't really understand it because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean unless it sparks interest.</v>

1166
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And So I was just sitting there watching</v>

1167
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 2>the documentary and he proved how a</v>
<v Speaker 2>light bends,</v>

1168
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like gravity,</v>

1169
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 2>gravity bends light and it just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me.</v>

1170
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is crazy.</v>

1171
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:50.740
<v Speaker 2>So I just started digging more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more.</v>

1172
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And you researched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1173
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.490
<v Speaker 2>the beginnings of when we started a</v>
<v Speaker 2>research enlightened,</v>

1174
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.170
<v Speaker 2>the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like newton figured out that like breaks</v>

1175
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:02.770
<v Speaker 2>and it's just the whole entire science</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of,</v>

1176
00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aspect of light gravity is just</v>

1177
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 2>blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

1178
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I just got hooked.</v>

1179
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Neil degrasse tyson was here two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and fuck my head up.</v>

1180
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.660
<v Speaker 3>My head has been broken ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that if you go one g like out</v>

1181
00:48:15.661 --> 00:48:16.770
<v Speaker 3>into space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

1182
00:48:16.771 --> 00:48:20.820
<v Speaker 3>if you are on a like a rocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shoots one g out in space.</v>

1183
00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 3>If it continues to go at one g,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that same force because there's no air</v>

1184
00:48:25.201 --> 00:48:27.990
<v Speaker 3>and space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of that because most of the</v>

1185
00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 3>time what they do with the rockets</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutoff and then you just move forward on</v>

1186
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:34.260
<v Speaker 3>the momentum because you're in a vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just flying through space.</v>

1187
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:39.680
<v Speaker 3>But if you continue to propel at one g</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will reach like just under the speed</v>

1188
00:48:41.761 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Speaker 3>of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you like,</v>

1189
00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:46.320
<v Speaker 3>if you go into somewhere that's five</v>
<v Speaker 3>light years away,</v>

1190
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 3>it would take one year more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of five years it will take</v>

1191
00:48:49.711 --> 00:48:50.544
<v Speaker 3>you six years.</v>

1192
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's 10 light years away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll take you 11 years.</v>

1193
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's a year under the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1194
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:59.010
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

1195
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.890
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how fast light moves and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get that fast almost as fast as the</v>

1196
00:49:05.671 --> 00:49:07.740
<v Speaker 3>speed of light by just going one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

1197
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.710
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been fucking with me for two</v>

1198
00:49:10.711 --> 00:49:12.180
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been just,</v>

1199
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll sometimes get up in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just trying to,</v>

1200
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.930
<v Speaker 3>trying to think of how fast that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's crazy.</v>

1201
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were watched someone whiz by</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1202
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.400
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even be able to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>

1203
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be too fast for you to see it.</v>

1204
00:49:24.991 --> 00:49:27.180
<v Speaker 3>And that's a person in a tube.</v>

1205
00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.120
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you started digging into the</v>

1206
00:49:30.121 --> 00:49:33.520
<v Speaker 2>relativity about that he's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>aging slower than you.</v>

1207
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's moving faster.</v>

1208
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that shit shit like that keeps me up</v>

1209
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 2>at night man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I wish like I'm to the point</v>

1210
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:44.780
<v Speaker 2>now where like I've done enough reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it like an in and unless I start</v>

1211
00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 2>learning the math of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've,</v>

1212
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I've reached my limit of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1213
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 2>of what to know about physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking about doing that?</v>

1214
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably gonna get back in school.</v>

1215
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you become like some fucking</v>

1216
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 2>certain scientists that'd be dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1217
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Go down there and work on the large</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadron collider or some shit to me that</v>

1218
00:50:00.261 --> 00:50:02.470
<v Speaker 2>that's more um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess any,</v>

1219
00:50:02.471 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 2>any kind of a goal that you set as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven year old and obtain is you should</v>

1220
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 2>be super proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like my conscious tells me he's</v>

1221
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't given anything to the</v>

1222
00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:14.380
<v Speaker 2>society and that's just the way my brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks.</v>

1223
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I do something like that,</v>

1224
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 2>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I've been bumping</v>

1225
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 2>around on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you now?</v>

1226
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.990
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you still got plenty of room?</v>

1227
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1228
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be coming late in the game,</v>

1229
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1230
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're</v>

1231
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.490
<v Speaker 3>coming into the game with a lot of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1232
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 3>like at an intense level that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just couldn't ever even</v>

1233
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 3>comprehend I show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1234
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be some sort of enhanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective from playing football at the</v>

1235
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 3>highest level in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

1236
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be something too that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're playing in the nfl,</v>

1237
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 3>the just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the amount of intensity and just</v>

1238
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.550
<v Speaker 3>the problem solving that you're having</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with on the field and just the</v>

1239
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 3>overcoming the physical injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mental strength did you have to</v>

1240
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 3>have to deal with the kind of pain that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had to experience that alone,</v>

1241
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:03.921
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1242
00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not seem like it applies,</v>

1243
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like everything applies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every,</v>

1244
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every book you read,</v>

1245
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 3>every relationship you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every friendship you have,</v>

1246
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.220
<v Speaker 3>everything that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes,</v>

1247
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 3>the way you look at life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things sort of added layers to</v>

1248
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 3>your existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not appreciate the pep talk,</v>

1249
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:26.561
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be crazy if you became some</v>

1250
00:51:26.931 --> 00:51:29.320
<v Speaker 3>crazy huge physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>esther,</v>

1251
00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 3>esther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>esther.</v>

1252
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That was a goal of my man is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to definitely</v>

1253
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.430
<v Speaker 3>bachelor's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's completely possible now for sure.</v>

1254
00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Bachelor'S as possible and phd is</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible too if you really want to work</v>

1255
00:51:39.461 --> 00:51:39.880
<v Speaker 3>towards it.</v>

1256
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.810
<v Speaker 2>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1257
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a long agregious process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1258
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm up for a minute.</v>

1259
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I just want to do a little more relaxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just retired.</v>

1260
00:51:47.711 --> 00:51:48.544
<v Speaker 2>And what</v>

1261
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.220
<v Speaker 3>november and what caused you to retire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like physically?</v>

1262
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.153
<v Speaker 3>Are you okay or.</v>

1263
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1264
00:51:52.471 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physically it was just a little bit of</v>

1265
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a couple of nagging injuries</v>

1266
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.970
<v Speaker 2>and I also saw him sitting on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sidelines and my,</v>

1267
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1268
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember vividly thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care at all who wins this game?</v>

1269
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't care man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1270
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.480
<v Speaker 3>and so like that's why</v>

1271
00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Adam Gates.</v>

1272
00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:13.530
<v Speaker 2>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the head coach of the miami</v>

1273
00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:15.840
<v Speaker 2>dolphins and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1274
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole organization in miami,</v>

1275
00:52:18.181 --> 00:52:20.280
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let me bow out gracefully.</v>

1276
00:52:20.281 --> 00:52:22.230
<v Speaker 2>They respected what I did in nfl and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

1277
00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:22.681
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1278
00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:24.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do how you want to do it and we're</v>

1279
00:52:24.571 --> 00:52:28.020
<v Speaker 2>not gonna make it hard for you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>some organizations can be a dick about</v>

1280
00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:29.850
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they could take money from you,</v>

1281
00:52:29.851 --> 00:52:33.480
<v Speaker 2>they could do all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were really good about the</v>

1282
00:52:33.481 --> 00:52:37.170
<v Speaker 2>process and It was because I guess it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I explained it to him,</v>

1283
00:52:37.171 --> 00:52:37.890
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1284
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they have a good team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like if I'm sitting here just</v>

1285
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:45.420
<v Speaker 2>holding on for a check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wasting your time and you're wasting</v>

1286
00:52:45.421 --> 00:52:47.370
<v Speaker 2>my time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there is no,</v>

1287
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason for me to be here</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because of my heart just isn't</v>

1288
00:52:49.961 --> 00:52:51.630
<v Speaker 2>in it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate what the game did for</v>

1289
00:52:51.631 --> 00:52:52.650
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

1290
00:52:52.651 --> 00:52:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and it's kept me driven for 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

1291
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.130
<v Speaker 2>but it was just time ago.</v>

1292
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.780
<v Speaker 3>That's a very balanced perspective for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

1293
00:52:58.781 --> 00:53:00.790
<v Speaker 3>The big paychecks are harder to walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from,</v>

1294
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:02.830
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1295
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.030
<v Speaker 3>but you have the point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the enough perspective,</v>

1296
00:53:07.031 --> 00:53:09.670
<v Speaker 3>enough objective perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look outside of it and go,</v>

1297
00:53:09.671 --> 00:53:11.650
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not where I want to be.</v>

1298
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1299
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:14.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a weird,</v>

1300
00:53:14.161 --> 00:53:16.240
<v Speaker 2>a parting too because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1301
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:18.690
<v Speaker 2>it's all I've known since I was seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old every,</v>

1302
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.890
<v Speaker 2>every fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1303
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.720
<v Speaker 2>and for one before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even before that,</v>

1304
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.970
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just all I've known,</v>

1305
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been my.</v>

1306
00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:25.990
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1307
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to the point where it's just</v>

1308
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 1>a whole big world out there and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to,</v>

1309
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I need to feed off that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1310
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 1>that's very confident of you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really powerful about that</v>

1311
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 1>is that you realize that you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting from scratch,</v>

1312
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously not because you're financially</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and you've got some stuff</v>

1313
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're entering into a completely</v>

1314
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 1>different world now as far as like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential of your future.</v>

1315
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1316
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 2>you got to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a humble cat man.</v>

1317
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought that I was any bigger or</v>

1318
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 2>better than like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that shit ever mad at me because</v>

1319
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be in the middle of a game man</v>

1320
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:07.110
<v Speaker 2>and think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>

1321
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 2>People just watching this play a game</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this shit is so it's like 100,000</v>

1322
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 2>people and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so awkward to me.</v>

1323
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 2>But I've always kept that perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't think anything of it</v>

1324
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't think anything of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a game at the end of the</v>

1325
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.183
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1326
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

1327
00:54:21.771 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 2>if the future is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1328
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wide open now.</v>

1329
00:54:24.721 --> 00:54:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1330
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

1331
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciative of everything that the game</v>

1332
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 1>has brought me though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you were in college that the</v>

1333
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:37.260
<v Speaker 1>big thing in college football is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the players getting paid off.</v>

1334
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.710
<v Speaker 1>They're getting money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:41.460
<v Speaker 1>they're getting like any of that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever happened with you.</v>

1336
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] uh,</v>

1337
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused a big stir awhile back because I</v>

1338
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:48.303
<v Speaker 1>made it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1339
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.093
<v Speaker 1>and this is a weird</v>

1340
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.800
<v Speaker 2>thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

1341
00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:55.610
<v Speaker 2>so players were mad at me for saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1342
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.031
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1343
00:54:56.031 --> 00:54:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say that you fuckIng it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the younger cats.</v>

1344
00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:00.980
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like once y'all realize that these</v>

1345
00:55:00.981 --> 00:55:05.150
<v Speaker 2>rules at the nca made or stupid and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all it takes is for everybody to stand</v>

1346
00:55:05.151 --> 00:55:08.600
<v Speaker 2>up and say this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll go away that their own</v>

1347
00:55:08.601 --> 00:55:10.550
<v Speaker 2>separate entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody answers,</v>

1348
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.770
<v Speaker 2>like they don't answer to anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't own,</v>

1349
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.100
<v Speaker 2>they're just the ncaa and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>contracts with the television stations</v>

1350
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.630
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's keeping them in play.</v>

1351
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.730
<v Speaker 2>The millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billions.</v>

1352
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.721
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1353
00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:24.554
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1354
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:28.180
<v Speaker 2>if the athletes finally wake up and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1355
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.870
<v Speaker 2>my dad had a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say all the top recruits stopped</v>

1356
00:55:31.871 --> 00:55:33.380
<v Speaker 2>going to the big schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1357
00:55:33.381 --> 00:55:36.290
<v Speaker 2>So they stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started going to place like grambling or</v>

1358
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:37.000
<v Speaker 2>what are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1359
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.330
<v Speaker 2>some of the smaller schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1360
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would take away the ncaas leverage</v>

1361
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:43.910
<v Speaker 2>and then you can start paying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>players.</v>

1362
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:47.630
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying that they should get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a salary like the nfl.</v>

1363
00:55:47.631 --> 00:55:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those semantics can be worked out when</v>

1364
00:55:50.001 --> 00:55:53.480
<v Speaker 2>the time comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I'm saying is the ncaa is,</v>

1365
00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:57.050
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're holding everybody hostage by a</v>

1366
00:55:57.051 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 2>system that was put in place in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties or twenties or something like</v>

1367
00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:05.600
<v Speaker 2>that when the big business of college</v>
<v Speaker 2>football wasn't even close to what it is</v>

1368
00:56:05.601 --> 00:56:06.760
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1369
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sponsorships and all of that</v>

1370
00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:10.880
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even near what it is now.</v>

1371
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:15.190
<v Speaker 2>You have the tostitos fiesta bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to know is sugar bowl.</v>

1372
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.320
<v Speaker 2>These are companies that are paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars in order to have</v>

1373
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:19.610
<v Speaker 2>them play under that,</v>

1374
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 1>under that guise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seems to me like that.</v>

1375
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>What colleges almost like a farm</v>

1376
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't want to call it that.</v>

1377
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1378
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you're pretending that these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>students and the kinds of students,</v>

1379
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean that you make them sit in class</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make them get a c.</v>

1380
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.960
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are cats that play that are going</v>

1381
00:56:36.961 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 2>to go pro in something that has sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1382
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it would be okay if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it the way they're doing it</v>

1383
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they pay the athletes and they make</v>

1384
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:48.200
<v Speaker 2>school and option that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1385
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 2>that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've discussed a lot of that van and</v>

1386
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1387
00:56:52.961 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you why.</v>

1388
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And I also think you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a degree in football because there</v>

1389
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 2>are so many jobs at the nfl has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1390
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 2>You have commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>

1391
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you have staff that work all</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the nfl offices?</v>

1392
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you major in football?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>

1393
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a business,</v>

1394
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 2>but the reason we're treating it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a business and we continue as</v>

1395
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:17.020
<v Speaker 2>soon as we wake up and say this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1396
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I think progression will happen and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>always does,</v>

1397
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:21.274
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1398
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 2>They're just holding onto this circular</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning.</v>

1399
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1400
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Speaker 2>they're amateur athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1401
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 2>why are the amateur athletes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't pay him,</v>

1402
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:28.530
<v Speaker 2>but why don't we paint?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're amateur athletics.</v>

1403
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1404
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1405
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.970
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like if you did get a degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>in football,</v>

1406
00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 2>then your time could be spent learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiology,</v>

1407
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning protocol</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it took me until I didn't really</v>

1408
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 2>understand nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got out of college honestly.</v>

1409
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.171
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1410
00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1411
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a nutritionist there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it wasn't as detailed as it is</v>

1412
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1413
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Like what were they telling you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what didn't care?</v>

1414
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care.</v>

1415
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1416
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.680
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking a lot and I was eating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of windows,</v>

1417
00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you're young,</v>

1418
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you're 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it don't affect your body,</v>

1419
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you can put whatever in your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1420
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you start getting a to</v>

1421
00:58:05.981 --> 00:58:07.350
<v Speaker 2>where this is your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1422
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 2>and you can start filling those burgers</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you the next day it was like,</v>

1423
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I need to look into this.</v>

1424
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:13.940
<v Speaker 2>So I looked into it independently and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I,</v>

1425
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand what nutrition for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>

1426
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I really don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

1427
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 2>you could do nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiology,</v>

1428
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that you're interested in and</v>

1429
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 2>that is a helpful to your craft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think when you're young that it</v>

1430
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:30.250
<v Speaker 2>doesn't affect your body or do you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not tuned in enough to your body</v>

1431
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:31.600
<v Speaker 2>to realize it's affecting you?</v>

1432
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I think a little bit of both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1433
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to watch what you eat as you</v>

1434
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:38.910
<v Speaker 2>get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

1435
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And when I really started noticing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a 23,</v>

1436
00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>24 when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1437
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.380
<v Speaker 2>those heavy weekends where I'm eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I want and getting drunk or</v>

1438
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.171
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1439
00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:50.320
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking with me.</v>

1440
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:53.700
<v Speaker 2>So I have to really start looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is good to put them on board and</v>

1441
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you kind of know just</v>
<v Speaker 2>based off the pyramid and you growing up</v>

1442
00:58:57.311 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 2>here and what's good and what's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1443
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 2>buT once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you understand and break down the</v>

1444
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 2>carbs and all of this stuff that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in your body,</v>

1445
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes your game to the next level.</v>

1446
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.130
<v Speaker 2>And it did that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of advice they give you in</v>

1447
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 2>college as far as nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they tell you to eat?</v>

1448
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.290
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of little grilled.</v>

1449
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Make sure nothing fried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to,</v>

1450
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to load up on carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A certain kind of carbs are good for</v>

1451
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so some carbs like sweet potatoes</v>

1452
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 2>are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were giving me that good</v>

1453
00:59:30.861 --> 00:59:32.480
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

1454
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't ready to receive the</v>

1455
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't fault them,</v>

1456
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:39.270
<v Speaker 2>but once you go to college then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>started really paying attention to it.</v>

1457
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1458
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 2>like what did you follow after that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1459
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:48.110
<v Speaker 2>this ain't the same model that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1460
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 2>so it was like the grill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grill,</v>

1461
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the grill stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's stuff like that.</v>

1462
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:53.570
<v Speaker 2>And then I have such an addictive</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

1463
00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I started doing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started getting into being a vegan</v>

1464
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.360
<v Speaker 2>and plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1465
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it led me to,</v>

1466
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 2>they're like a researching food and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>

1467
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>that lifestyle lifestyle's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1468
01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I tried it for about six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven months,</v>

1469
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.940
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1470
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean I tried the best I could to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>as healthy as I could.</v>

1471
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.370
<v Speaker 2>But what happened with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trying vegan?</v>

1472
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really good,</v>

1473
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a lot of good people with vegans</v>

1474
01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:26.210
<v Speaker 2>come out of the woodworks to show the</v>
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>

1475
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also put you into a good team when</v>

1476
01:00:29.811 --> 01:00:30.644
<v Speaker 2>you leave though.</v>

1477
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Trader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1478
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.700
<v Speaker 2>they get mad superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1479
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1480
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of support the lifestyle man.</v>

1481
01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a vegan and drink coke and</v>

1482
01:00:43.071 --> 01:00:46.730
<v Speaker 2>eat chips all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like plant based lifestyle,</v>

1483
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's really healthy and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1484
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I felt really good while I was eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1485
01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me I got tired of constantly</v>

1486
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Speaker 2>worrying about what I was going to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my body.</v>

1487
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so every meal was a prep,</v>

1488
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I had to do it every single end and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in our,</v>

1489
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>in our lives is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a celebration and all celebration is</v>

1490
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 2>usually centered around food and meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got tired of doing that,</v>

1491
01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:11.354
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1492
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>if I died two years earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really think you're going to</v>

1493
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:17.100
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's bad for the eat meat?</v>

1494
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In moderation.</v>

1495
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just load up on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1496
01:01:21.321 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>it can be unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

1497
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating a vegan diet,</v>

1498
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.450
<v Speaker 2>did you notice performance benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1499
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 2>it's all anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any,</v>

1500
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1501
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I recovered a little faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1502
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.140
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all anecdotal and it could have</v>

1503
01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>been holding my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just eating a lot of vegetables.</v>

1504
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.740
<v Speaker 2>We'll do that for you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you eat meat at all or</v>

1505
01:01:45.741 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 2>fish or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's so beneficial to eat a</v>

1506
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>lot of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1507
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>And look at one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a different show.</v>

1508
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Is it cleanse me like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1509
01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>your bowel movements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it juSt slides out and that's</v>

1510
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.420
<v Speaker 2>not to get too grotesque man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's really</v>

1511
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merrily I'll do it,</v>

1512
01:02:05.841 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

1513
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>you noticed a difference and you really</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what a healthy bowel movement</v>

1514
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>is and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not healthy no matter if you're just</v>

1515
01:02:12.831 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>eating cheeseburgers and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting a lot of vegetables</v>

1516
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.590
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of fiber and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't even know.</v>

1517
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different,</v>

1518
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a different uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you blend it.</v>

1519
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>If we blend like kale shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bridges,</v>

1520
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>lubes the whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't big on the uh,</v>

1521
01:02:28.751 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>on the blender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1522
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm big on it because I can eat way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I would ever in a salad.</v>

1523
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

1524
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much you can eat in a</v>

1525
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:37.540
<v Speaker 1>salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but five,</v>

1526
01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:41.620
<v Speaker 1>blend that shit up and break it down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 ounces of like semi liquid.</v>

1527
01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>RigHt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of weight of vegetables and</v>

1528
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>just seems to me that just massive boost</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nutrients that enter into your</v>

1529
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and your digestive tract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not as good with the patients.</v>

1530
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1531
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.461
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1532
01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>what about protein when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1533
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>being a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you,</v>

1534
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you use like pea protein or a hemp</v>

1535
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>protein?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of protein?</v>

1536
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>We stay away from him because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1537
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>they test for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1538
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>for weed and they said sometimes I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1539
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to take the chance.</v>

1540

1544
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 1>don't know why they would say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you get good hamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1575
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 2>When I had my back surgery in 2014 or</v>

1599
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>being fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1600
01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's slowly but surely it's starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become legal recreationally.</v>

1601
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It's legal now in California</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreationally.</v>

1602
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>But the federal government is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>resisting it because of the influence of</v>

1603
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>the pharmaceutical companies and also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other people that like the</v>

1604
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>prison guard unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want it to be legal because</v>

1605
01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 1>they have less people to arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fucked up.</v>

1606
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know the prison industrial complex.</v>

1607
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A real thing.</v>

1608
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 1>They're making money off people being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cages.</v>

1609
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like are people are human batteries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get money off of this matrix.</v>

1610
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>The matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1611
01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very low level version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the matrix.</v>

1612
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>But it's terrifying if that logic with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the science that's in place about</v>

1613
01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>what's dangerous and what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're prescribing percocet.</v>

1614
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 1>So like here fella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take these.</v>

1615
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young strapping,</v>

1616
01:06:22.031 --> 01:06:24.220
<v Speaker 1>buck wants to take some shit that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you hooked.</v>

1617
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 1>They have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this,</v>

1618
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>this waiver we have to sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

1619
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.850
<v Speaker 1>this is painkiller called toradol in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nfl,</v>

1620
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1621
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I took it a lot because prescribed</v>

1622
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>that shit to my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1623
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a great dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got bit so like for.</v>

1624
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>So if a tornado we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to sign this waiver that says</v>

1625
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of just given up your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1626
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 1>we're not responsible for but they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us take that,</v>

1627
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but they won't let us smoke weed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're abandoned dudes that smoke weed</v>

1628
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:52.200
<v Speaker 1>and suspended dudes.</v>

1629
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He retired because even just,</v>

1630
01:06:55.081 --> 01:06:56.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave josh gordon.</v>

1631
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.070
<v Speaker 1>He played receiver for the browns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the best young receivers</v>

1632
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I've seen in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1633
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 1>they banned him for a year because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested positive for two or three times</v>

1634
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean granted he needs to be smarter,</v>

1635
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but like you're throwing away an entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical career because of weed,</v>

1636
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>like it's crack cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1637
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's trying to send a message</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the youth to stay away from the</v>

1638
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 1>illegal drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan all over again trying to rule off</v>

1639
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 1>of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fear,</v>

1640
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not based on reality.</v>

1641
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>The reality is if you were to legalize</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

1642
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can regulate it and that way you can</v>

1643
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>do it in a controlled environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way you don't have all of this.</v>

1644
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition of alcohol.</v>

1645
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Legalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1646
01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 1>that's also what they're doing right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an opiate.</v>

1647
01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean oxy cottons are not illegal.</v>

1648
01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They can be prescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to have a doctor</v>

1649
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 1>prescribes this ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty crazy.</v>

1650
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy when people realize</v>

1651
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>that marijuana helps pain relief as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not better than all that stuff and it</v>

1652
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any of the addictive</v>
<v Speaker 1>properties and if you do the.</v>

1653
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>There have been people that have said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's addictive and there's some,</v>

1654
01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>some studies that pointed that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain individuals,</v>

1655
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but I would state that those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably addicted to fucking everything.</v>

1656
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't call it physically.</v>

1657
01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't get how marijuana is addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't make any sense.</v>

1658
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I've smoked pot every day for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll take like a month off and</v>

1659
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.133
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1660
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Not an ache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pain,</v>

1661
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>not a no shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

1662
01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Just you just don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like drink orange juice then don't</v>

1663
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>drink the orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1664
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Really nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens.</v>

1665
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:31.041
<v Speaker 1>I'll get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1666
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:31.874
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1667
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like a heavy smoker like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1668
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1669
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had on a saturday night when I ain't</v>

1670
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>going nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all set up my pipe and my,</v>

1671
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.460
<v Speaker 1>my second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch a great movie.</v>

1672
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Why not fall asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it man.</v>

1674
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile you can get percosets or</v>
<v Speaker 1>get drunk as hell and ruin your liver.</v>

1675
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a nose operation.</v>

1677
01:08:55.041 --> 01:09:00.041
<v Speaker 1>They've got my deviated septum fixed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dogs began to nothing.</v>

1678
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 1>They told me it was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people fucking complaining about</v>

1679
01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:05.570
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember before I got tattooed people</v>

1680
01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:06.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1681
01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>patches are so painful in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoo.</v>

1682
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1683
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the shit that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

1684
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit hurts.</v>

1685
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1686
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying like not playing tough guy,</v>

1687
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but I really wonder what pain feels like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>

1688
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I assume that I know what your pain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1689
01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if that's true because</v>

1690
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.200
<v Speaker 1>why does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I like certain foods and other</v>

1691
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:31.780
<v Speaker 1>people think it tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:09:31.781 --> 01:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>and something's got to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bothers me too.</v>

1693
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.770
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your taste buds.</v>

1694
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not just simple like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take it.</v>

1695
01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people will experience different</v>

1696
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 1>sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills me how people don't like spicy</v>

1697
01:09:46.731 --> 01:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I love spicy Food.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And maybe I just like a little bit of</v>

1702
01:09:56.631 --> 01:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>pain every now and then.</v>

01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm open man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place down the street actually</v>

1724
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:46.790
<v Speaker 1>that sells it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The California.</v>

1725
01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:49.070
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of bones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chickens.</v>

1726
01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's good.</v>

1727
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You can taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A different kind of guy.</v>

1728
01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:53.144
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1729
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Chicken is probably the best tasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone broth.</v>

1730
01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Jamie grease spot in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to called bravo broth.</v>

1731
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like my grandma's do,</v>

1732
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tasted like chicken soup,</v>

1733
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:06.710
<v Speaker 1>just the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the broth,</v>

1734
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just boiling bones.</v>

1735
01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 1>That shit is brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of people drinking</v>

1736
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>boone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty recent.</v>

1737
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean not really mean people</v>

1738
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 4>been doing it for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty recent as a fad around</v>

1739
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:19.470
<v Speaker 4>here in particular and there's a place</v>
<v Speaker 4>out here,</v>

1740
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called sunlife organics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The joint that cells bone broth and they</v>

1741
01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.370
<v Speaker 4>add,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll add a little hot sauce to it and</v>

1742
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:27.900
<v Speaker 4>that's where I got the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1743
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 4>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1744
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 4>And so then I buy bone broth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buy it in bulk,</v>

1745
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 4>bring it home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have like at any given time I might</v>

1746
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 4>have 40 bottles of bone broth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>refrigerator that's been entered.</v>

1747
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:39.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's great.</v>

1748
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:42.730
<v Speaker 4>I never even as it made his way to Texas</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

1749
01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 4>What about bone marrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do every bone marrow.</v>

1750
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never had a bone before</v>

1751
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.270
<v Speaker 4>in any aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1752
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of fancy restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell bone marrow and what they're</v>

1753
01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 4>doing is they're taking the femur of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cow.</v>

1754
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.970
<v Speaker 4>They saw it and then they slice it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The middle peter going crazy.</v>

1755
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Then they cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bacon in the oven and there's like a</v>

1756
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 4>gelatinous fatty substance in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incredibly nutritious and</v>

1757
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:15.210
<v Speaker 4>especially like these days where people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are on these real high fat key to genic</v>

1758
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 4>based diets are all the rage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are eating bone marrow.</v>

1759

<v Speaker 4>Show them some bone marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young jamie,</v>

1760
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:23.730

<v Speaker 4>So you'll get that and a lot of times</v>

1761
01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 4>people see that like with a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>toast.</v>

1762
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:29.290
<v Speaker 4>People like it with toast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just take the bone marrow with a</v>

1763
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 4>fork and scoop it out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the dark stuff in the center there,</v>

1764
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 4>scoop it out of there with a fork and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just slurp it down.</v>

1765

1769
01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:47.570
<v Speaker 4>You eat organ meat like from actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>liver heart and that's the way to Oregon</v>

1770
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:50.461
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1771
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:54.090

1776
01:13:03.071 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think it's one of those things</v>

1777
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:09.140
<v Speaker 4>were poor people aided initially because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want it to go to waste.</v>

1778
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Like we're wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would eat like the finer cuts of</v>

01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:36.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got It.</v>

1837
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1838
01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:40.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1839
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:44.230
<v Speaker 1>green chilies and New Mexico are</v>
<v Speaker 1>synonymous.</v>

1840
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:45.710
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1841
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what I grew up on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when I,</v>

1842
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>when I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1843
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school in san diego and I</v>

1844
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:52.780
<v Speaker 1>left and I like ordered something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>green chili on it.</v>

1845
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It was not to Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was accustomed to when I was like,</v>

1846
01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:56.710
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1847
01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Like an order mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like what I looked at as like</v>

1848
01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 1>texmex yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just not the same and I was</v>

1849
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.660
<v Speaker 1>disappointed to say the least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone needs to talk to Donald</v>

1850
01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Trump for the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these mexicans out,</v>

1851
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fuck up the entire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tripping.</v>

1852
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy stripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's scary because you just give</v>

1853
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:17.310
<v Speaker 1>these people look if you give people the</v>
<v Speaker 1>green light to start rating people and</v>

1854
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.720
<v Speaker 1>catching people when they're dropping</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids off at school,</v>

1855
01:16:19.721 --> 01:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>which is some of the stuff that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been seen in the news.</v>

1856
01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of it as happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what's happening,</v>

1857
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but when you're making it dangerous for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to get an education,</v>

1858
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you're making it dangerous for kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get educated.</v>

1859
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1860
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 1>The shit that gets me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man is like the majority of trump</v>

1861
01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:40.150
<v Speaker 1>supporters are like christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1862
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:43.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at jesus's main</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages,</v>

1863
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 1>like love thy neighbor and Mexico is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

1864
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the disdain,</v>

1865
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.340
<v Speaker 1>like I don't understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do the right thing,</v>

1866
01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their paperwork come over here the right</v>

1867
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way my granddaddy did.</v>

1868
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Your granddaddy got on a raft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you piece of shit.</v>

1869
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You know the grand daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody came up with the mayflower,</v>

1870
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any fucking paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1871
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.930
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of those facts matter.</v>

1872
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Those people like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1873
01:17:09.841 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

1874
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.350
<v Speaker 3>understand that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that turn the other cheek shit and</v>

1875
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some faggot.</v>

1876
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:16.520
<v Speaker 3>True that jesus wrote about back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day before they understood that faggot</v>

1877
01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:21.200
<v Speaker 3>shit was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get mad whenever somebody said,</v>

1878
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>how come every time you talk about trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>supports use a shitty southern accent.</v>

1879
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe because he'd get upset.</v>

1880
01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I will keep doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1881
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1882
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a real weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking,</v>

1883
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some weird ideas about</v>

1884
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 3>nationalism and boundaries and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that because I think that America</v>

1885
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 3>is more of an idea than it is a place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think America as an idea is a great</v>

1886
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing to have this one</v>

1887
01:17:48.021 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 3>place where there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably more creativity and</v>

1888
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:55.250
<v Speaker 3>more innovation in this country and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>music and art,</v>

1889
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more fascinating things happening in</v>

1890
01:17:57.831 --> 01:17:59.750
<v Speaker 3>this country than almost any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1891
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's great things happening</v>

1892
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:02.090
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1893
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:07.330
<v Speaker 3>but I mean this is a hotbed of</v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity and innovation and art and I</v>

1894
01:18:07.731 --> 01:18:11.000
<v Speaker 3>think that's what makes me proud to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be an american.</v>

1895
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 3>If I was proud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be proud of like all the people that</v>

1896
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:15.590
<v Speaker 3>came before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that were here,</v>

1897
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1898
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:22.001
<v Speaker 3>all the neil degrasse tyson's and jimi</v>
<v Speaker 3>hendrix and all the fucking greg,</v>

1899
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lenny bruce and richard pryor and all</v>

1900
01:18:25.821 --> 01:18:30.821
<v Speaker 3>the art and comedy and writing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>history and all the science and</v>

1901
01:18:31.311 --> 01:18:34.160
<v Speaker 3>mathematics and all the great shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been accomplished in this one</v>

1902
01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:35.060
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1903
01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not a border,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a line in the sand.</v>

1904
01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:41.360
<v Speaker 3>To me it's more like an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>

1905
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:44.630
<v Speaker 3>the idea always been about people come</v>
<v Speaker 3>here because they want to do better,</v>

1906
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.840
<v Speaker 3>so you're trying to stop people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing better and they're like,</v>

1907
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:49.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gotta they gotta fill out their</v>

1908
01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.520
<v Speaker 3>paperwork and they got to do it right</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way our grandparents did know,</v>

1909
01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 3>our grandparents didn't do it that way.</v>

1910
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 3>It was easy to come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back when my grandparents came over,</v>

1911
01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.340
<v Speaker 3>my grandparents came over on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came over from Italy and they just</v>

1912
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.390
<v Speaker 3>got on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking easy.</v>

1913
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:04.070
<v Speaker 3>They got to ellis island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sign here.</v>

1914
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's good.</v>

1915
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now you know,</v>

1916
01:19:07.141 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 3>you say it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to make it harder for people to</v>

1917
01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:12.620
<v Speaker 3>come across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost impossible.</v>

1918
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.190
<v Speaker 3>If you want to immigrate from Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a poor person and you want to</v>

1919
01:19:16.191 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 3>immigrate here from Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good fucking luck.</v>

1920
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not easy.</v>

1921
01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to come here from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

1922
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends that have tried to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>here from Canada.</v>

1923
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to get a green card or try to become</v>

1924
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:29.630
<v Speaker 3>a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy shit.</v>

1925
01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Is it hard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive process.</v>

1926
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend,</v>

1927
01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:35.720
<v Speaker 3>a good friend of mine and his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>met a guy in Colorado and she came down</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and just got a new boyfriend,</v>

1929
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:42.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stay with you in Colorado.</v>

1930
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:43.850
<v Speaker 3>She cannot work because she's from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

1931
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:44.743
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1932
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they just assume like,</v>

1933
01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're from that patch of dirt.</v>

1934
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:50.140
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to work over in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>patch of dirt.</v>

1935
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1936
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.030

<v Speaker 3>She's a normal functioning shot,</v>

1937
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:55.820
<v Speaker 3>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's educated,</v>

1938
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.140
<v Speaker 3>she's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She talks well like,</v>

1939
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:01.610
<v Speaker 3>why can't you just work like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else could work getting work at jamba</v>

1940
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:02.430
<v Speaker 3>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1941
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I said it's paranoia man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people just are afraid of</v>

1942
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.000
<v Speaker 3>everything and granted that</v>

1943
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 2>all real threats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1944
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 2>But it's like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't feel.</v>

1945
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I just don't believe in living in that</v>

1946
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1947
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:19.161
<v Speaker 1>It's just a constant state of hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nationalism,</v>

1948
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's team.</v>

1949
01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a team mentality but not a team</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality and a positive sense.</v>

1950
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And a team mentality and an exclusionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense like you're excluding all these</v>

1951
01:20:27.931 --> 01:20:30.190
<v Speaker 1>other people from joining the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1952
01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 1>well if they all come over here then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to ruin our quality of</v>

1953
01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

1954
01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure</v>

1955
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>National nationalism is.</v>

1956
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the worst things actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1957
01:20:41.811 --> 01:20:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1958
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm super proud.</v>

1959
01:20:44.511 --> 01:20:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I love America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a dope place to be,</v>

1960
01:20:46.251 --> 01:20:48.680
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>

1961
01:20:48.681 --> 01:20:52.110
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck your country over my country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it had never hit me.</v>

1962
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Like my pride isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't like that.</v>

1963
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And my pride is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dope to be from here and I enjoy it</v>

1964
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:58.100

<v Speaker 2>I don't have any disdain towards any of</v>

1966
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:00.830
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1968
01:21:01.431 --> 01:21:03.500
<v Speaker 1>what fucks me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that team mentality.</v>

1969
01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You could break it down to the macro</v>
<v Speaker 1>level because people in houston don't</v>

1970
01:21:07.161 --> 01:21:09.890
<v Speaker 1>like people from dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1971
01:21:09.891 --> 01:21:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like it gets goofY.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1972
01:21:11.721 --> 01:21:14.150

<v Speaker 1>I mean it reallY might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you tell it's big though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that should know the region right</v>

2005
01:22:37.191 --> 01:22:37.880
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2007
01:22:40.071 --> 01:22:45.071
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny arguing people,</v>

2008
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:49.400
<v Speaker 1>they just have talking points and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever think about anything.</v>

2009
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2010
01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.280

<v Speaker 1>You can have talking points and you can</v>

2011
01:22:52.281 --> 01:22:54.860
<v Speaker 1>have points and their points are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not</v>

2012
01:22:56.450 --> 01:23:00.110
<v Speaker 1>to Be discussed and debated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people get so many solid</v>

2013
01:23:00.111 --> 01:23:03.640
<v Speaker 1>opinions on certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that nobody has rocks out</v>

2014
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>of the pens because they're usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their beliefs aren't based on any kind</v>

2015
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:11.470
<v Speaker 1>of a foundation and the research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all based on somebody that says</v>

2016
01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:12.330
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2017
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Usually on podcasts or television that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they agree with and all of a sudden your</v>

2018
01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:19.330
<v Speaker 1>opinion becomes a fax from sean hannity</v>

2021
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.730
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if they weren't human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

2022
01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.890
<v Speaker 1>if you had like some neanderthals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in Mexico and they were dangerous,</v>

2023
01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>they like to eat people like,</v>

2027
01:23:38.711 --> 01:23:42.400

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the craziest shit ever.</v>

2032
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this documentary on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of Israel and palestine.</v>

2033
01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've been looking for one.</v>

2034
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.010

<v Speaker 1>I'm So,</v>

2035
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 1>so trying to do to quite a few of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

2036
01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to find one because I don't think</v>

2037
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>a documentary honestly is comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2038
01:24:03.221 --> 01:24:08.221
<v Speaker 1>I'd really good book like I've tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read up on it and it just gets deeper</v>

2039
01:24:08.471 --> 01:24:12.010
<v Speaker 1>and deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to unravel.</v>

2040
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 1>These people have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2041
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:19.980
<v Speaker 1>at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Israel is this one strange area,</v>

2042
01:24:20.111 --> 01:24:22.120
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have this jewish state</v>

2043
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:27.270
<v Speaker 1>that's surrounded virtually on all sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>by arab states and and they hate Israel.</v>

2044
01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Israel hates them and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>push people out and then the</v>

2045
01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:35.690
<v Speaker 1>palestinians are claiming that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>their land and they were pushed out and</v>

2046
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I used to do this bit and people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so fucking mad at me.</v>

2047
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 1>They used to get so mad at me because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2048
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I said that I was watching tv and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this thing about the</v>

2049
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:47.560
<v Speaker 1>palestinians versus the israelis and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2050
01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:52.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a brown skinned guy with dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>curly hair throwing rocks at a brown</v>

2051
01:24:53.501 --> 01:24:56.110
<v Speaker 1>skinned guy with dark curly hair holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>a machine gun.</v>

2052
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys look super fucking similar.</v>

2053
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.320
<v Speaker 1>This like watching a tennis match</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

2054
01:25:02.321 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 1>The williams sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this isn't like the africans</v>

2055
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:08.920
<v Speaker 1>versus the nordic people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could clearly tell like one if</v>

2056
01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you've seen an african person and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see someone from China.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I see you guys look real different,</v>

2058
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:19.290

<v Speaker 1>fucking so close until they talk.</v>

2059

<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2062
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2063
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:31.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's similar enough that they could</v>

2064
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>pass for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:34.420
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's debatable.</v>

2066
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:35.703
<v Speaker 1>Debatable.</v>

2067
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 1>We got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2068
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:40.623
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2069
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.770
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be search type pictures way</v>

2070
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me sir.</v>

2071
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Turns out the panel of students or one</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound heavier on average.</v>

2072
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucked up when you see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a dispute that you don't think</v>

2073
01:25:56.831 --> 01:25:58.900
<v Speaker 1>is ever going to get settled inside your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime now.</v>

2074
01:25:59.090 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2075
01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it definitely won't be an hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a state that was established</v>

2076
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still there today and there's still</v>

2077
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>hotly under debate and you're wondering</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2078
01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I,</v>

2079
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's such a hot button issue too</v>

2080
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>because it's like as soon as you bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up,</v>

2081
01:26:14.721 --> 01:26:15.141
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2082
01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2083
01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just honest inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2084
01:26:18.921 --> 01:26:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't really know enough about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2085
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to read up on it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to Be super,</v>

2086
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:27.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2087
01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.520
<v Speaker 1>there's little red flag that raised it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

2088
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Then during this last republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before trump was president,</v>

2089
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the republican debates were all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them on a panel,</v>

2090
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.640
<v Speaker 1>lIke they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super privileged Israel.</v>

2091
01:26:38.641 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm so pro Israel and all of them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro Israel too.</v>

2092
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you so proud?</v>

2093
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It just made me think lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what made me start digging</v>

2094
01:26:45.861 --> 01:26:46.970
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2095
01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2096
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with a lot of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans say and so it just makes me</v>

2097
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 1>think what is the underlying issue here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's christianity.</v>

2098
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing because the pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel people,</v>

2099
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the really heavy duty evangelical</v>
<v Speaker 1>christians,</v>

2100
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they really truly believed that inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lifetime jesus is going to return.</v>

2101
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to return to Israel.</v>

2102
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2103
01:27:12.141 --> 01:27:15.190
<v Speaker 1>there was a vice documentary on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I mean,</v>

2104
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it's probably deeper than that.</v>

2105
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2106
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 1>well it's hard loan ally that's non</v>
<v Speaker 1>muslim in that area.</v>

2107
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:24.700
<v Speaker 1>How did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they become our outlier?</v>

2108
01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Because we armed the fuck out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that had to be a reason</v>

2109
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:28.400
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2110
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we see the way they live their</v>

2111
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:34.280
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's very many reasons I'm</v>

2112
01:27:34.281 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>simplifying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much closer to ours.</v>

2113
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Then these arab states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean women in Israel,</v>

2114
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all the rights that women in</v>

2115
01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:46.340
<v Speaker 1>America do pretty sure other than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they have to go to the army,</v>

2116
01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have mandatory army service and</v>

2117
01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people think would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing for America.</v>

2118
01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Mandatory military service because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make you understand like this</v>

2119
01:27:55.130 --> 01:28:00.130
<v Speaker 1>about sacrifice and discipline and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a part of this thing instead</v>

2120
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:01.100
<v Speaker 1>of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:28:01.101 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 1>we should go over there and kick their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass like whose we are you doing that?</v>

2122
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Well you're going to send your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly know.</v>

2123
01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:07.154
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

2124
01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd have way fewer in her</v>

2125
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:14.840
<v Speaker 1>interactions with other countries if</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's kids had to go over there</v>

2126
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:17.270
<v Speaker 1>and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would be less than it would if it</v>

2127
01:28:17.271 --> 01:28:19.790
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a voluntary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was an involuntary thing,</v>

2128
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:22.580
<v Speaker 1>we'd be much more judicious in our use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of military.</v>

2129
01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.920
<v Speaker 1>When you brought up that a dehumanizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2130
01:28:24.921 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's to me when when people bring a war</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that,</v>

2131
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:29.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like they just throw out these</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

2132
01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Like those Weren't humans that died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit boggles my mind.</v>

2133
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:35.530
<v Speaker 1>like if that was your mother or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

2134
01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.790
<v Speaker 1>sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe maybe people do feel like we</v>

2135
01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:40.520
<v Speaker 1>as he gave his life to a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like for me it's like man,</v>

2136
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day I was fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt and nobody owns.</v>

2137
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't take it with you and your box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

2138
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2139
01:28:47.271 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to fix parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2140
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at it like what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on right now in Syria,</v>

2141
01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 1>how many people are gonna have to die</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they figure out that part of the</v>

2142
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that like if you were there</v>

2143
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you would just want to get the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of there as quickly as possible because</v>

2144
01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:11.730
<v Speaker 3>everybody could die at any moment there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and any moment anything could happen.</v>

2145
01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Missiles are slamming into apartment</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

2146
01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just gotta get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and that can happen in this world.</v>

2147
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Like the world conflicts can escalate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where they're just nonsensical</v>

2148
01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 3>where you can't make any sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta get the fuck out.</v>

2149
01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were living right now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria,</v>

2150
01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2151
01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.470
<v Speaker 3>part of me wants to fight for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my city,</v>

2152
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:32.820
<v Speaker 3>this is my country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where I'm from.</v>

2153
01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And parties like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck</v>

2154
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:36.110
<v Speaker 2>this Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2155
01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we go to journal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't got that any man.</v>

2156
01:29:38.711 --> 01:29:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like.</v>

2157
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:45.390
<v Speaker 2>My pride runs from my inner circle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family to my community and after that</v>

2158
01:29:46.191 --> 01:29:48.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we fighting for?</v>

2159
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're stepping in my,</v>

2160
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:53.140
<v Speaker 2>my home base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the point,</v>

2161
01:29:53.141 --> 01:29:54.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't got that emmy.</v>

2162
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to something like world war</v>

2163
01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.880
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to something like the nazis</v>

2164
01:29:57.881 --> 01:29:59.530
<v Speaker 2>were trying to take over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2165
01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Pushing into Poland and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2166
01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:02.760
<v Speaker 2>we got a real problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That make sense?</v>

2167
01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:03.521
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2168
01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Might really like what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>

2169
01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:07.850
<v Speaker 2>North Korea scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>

2170
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2171
01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:13.450
<v Speaker 2>so you got a juggernaut country like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that who's basically waving a flag</v>

2172
01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:14.730
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fuck with you,</v>

2173
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

2174
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm all by myself and we don't really do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2175
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.450
<v Speaker 2>We don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2176
01:30:20.451 --> 01:30:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the problem is they do do things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do know.</v>

2177
01:30:23.231 --> 01:30:25.900
<v Speaker 2>They know that what I'm saying we to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them you mean?</v>

2178
01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're looking at them now.</v>

2179
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean those apparently this is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>rumor and not who knows what,</v>

2180
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:36.030
<v Speaker 3>what was really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently that's the main thing</v>

2181
01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:40.440
<v Speaker 3>that Donald Trump was informed about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When obama left office.</v>

2182
01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 3>One of the things obama said like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the biggest issue is North Korea.</v>

2183
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:48.450
<v Speaker 3>These is a maniac that kim jong un is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking murderous maniac and he's</v>

2184
01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 3>running a military dictatorship so and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got prison camps and they've got</v>

2185
01:30:52.651 --> 01:30:55.470
<v Speaker 3>these people that are born in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're born prisoners,</v>

2186
01:30:55.471 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 3>they're their slaves and they killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2187
01:30:57.721 --> 01:30:59.130
<v Speaker 3>They do whatever the fuck they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2188
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:01.920
<v Speaker 3>If you don't listen to those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't listen to the military,</v>

2189
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:03.810
<v Speaker 3>they can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no rights.</v>

2190
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:04.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2191
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:09.180
<v Speaker 3>people were put in jail because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't mourn hard enough for the death</v>

2192
01:31:09.181 --> 01:31:10.660
<v Speaker 3>of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:14.670
<v Speaker 3>They were given jail sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard labor,</v>

2194
01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't try hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>

2195
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:17.950
<v Speaker 3>We played it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was these people.</v>

2196
01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like the worst acting you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>

2197
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 3>The people on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while kim,</v>

2198
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:24.690
<v Speaker 3>when kim jong il died and they were just</v>
<v Speaker 3>wailing,</v>

2199
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.300
<v Speaker 3>just fallen down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't.</v>

2200
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't cry hard enough and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to do it.</v>

2201
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.580
<v Speaker 3>They had to do it publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so nuts.</v>

2202
01:31:32.890 --> 01:31:33.760
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I need to do,</v>

2203
01:31:33.761 --> 01:31:34.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to.</v>

2204
01:31:34.331 --> 01:31:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty up on my domestic politics.</v>

2205
01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of out of the loop on foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and I'm out of the loop on</v>

2206
01:31:41.471 --> 01:31:42.211
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just talked.</v>

2207
01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a few Youtube videos.</v>

2208
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I read a few articles occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A book crosses my eyes.</v>

2209
01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:50.440
<v Speaker 2>It's good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time I don't know what the</v>

2210
01:31:50.441 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 2>fuck I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much to know.</v>

2211
01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 2>That's true man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2212
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:56.350
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely true man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you wanted to.</v>

2213
01:31:56.351 --> 01:31:58.230
<v Speaker 2>If I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I really sat down with someone who's</v>

2214
01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>a real expert</v>

2215
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.790
<v Speaker 1>on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you really get you.</v>

2216
01:32:02.791 --> 01:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>You really get a guy who knows a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>aBout one area.</v>

2217
01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.600
<v Speaker 1>if a re a real expert on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you were talking to someone who's</v>

2218
01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>an expert on China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like international relationships with</v>

2219
01:32:12.521 --> 01:32:15.010
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the international relationships with</v>

2220
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably super complex,</v>

2221
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:20.990
<v Speaker 1>is probably so much to know and so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand it so much to go over like</v>

2222
01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:21.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2223
01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the for you to be a real expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you fucking know all that?</v>

2224
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you possibly know all that?</v>

2225
01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my problems is like once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I.</v>

2226
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Once I want to learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to learn everything about it.</v>

2227
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned conceptually.</v>

2228
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2229
01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>there's bad though because like I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>one track mind so like it'll consume me</v>

2230
01:32:40.991 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 1>for three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how people get good at</v>

2231
01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:45.010
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2232
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably why you were a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>football player.</v>

2233
01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's obsession becomes</v>

2234
01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:50.580
<v Speaker 1>obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like that's the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who gets really good at things.</v>

2236
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 1>You get just completely nuts about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get absorbed with it.</v>

2237
01:32:56.831 --> 01:32:58.570
<v Speaker 1>That's true because if you just casual</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2238
01:32:58.571 --> 01:33:00.040
<v Speaker 1>but the dude next to is obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2239
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get better,</v>

2240
01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just no doubt about it.</v>

2241
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way around it,</v>

2242
01:33:05.051 --> 01:33:06.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2243
01:33:06.521 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a training jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily,</v>

2244
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I would still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still had jobs and stuff,</v>

2245
01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was busy,</v>

2246
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but I would meet these young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like 17 and 18.</v>

2247
01:33:17.531 --> 01:33:20.800
<v Speaker 1>They be training two times a day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights as well,</v>

2248
01:33:20.801 --> 01:33:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and just constantly going over new moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2249
01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 1>this dude has no way I'm catching up.</v>

2250
01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>There's one they have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have that real true passion</v>

2251
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 1>obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way to hit real</v>

2252
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:33.370
<v Speaker 1>excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2253
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I always tell kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2254
01:33:34.931 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2255
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:37.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2256
01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this,</v>

2257
01:33:39.591 --> 01:33:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to be at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>

2258
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea to discipline it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to be the best at your craft.</v>

2259
01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't understand that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people will look at like,</v>

2260
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2261
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.980
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2262
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.940
<v Speaker 1>we kind of take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted the,</v>

2263
01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the top of the top of the top of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of anything really,</v>

2264
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take that shit for granted because</v>

2265
01:33:57.401 --> 01:34:01.480
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a finished product and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the story behind it until</v>

2266
01:34:01.481 --> 01:34:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it hits the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits the,</v>

2267
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 1>the show that you love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching what the people who are best at</v>

2268
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 1>what they do have been doing it for.</v>

2269
01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Like a great example is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedy right?</v>

2270
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pisses me off when people say like</v>

2271
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:17.410
<v Speaker 1>overnight sensation about a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2272
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>But then you dig into their background</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've been working on like 18,</v>

2273
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:23.800
<v Speaker 1>20 years they've been doing gigs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been going on shows and they've</v>

2274
01:34:23.801 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 1>been just kind of harnessing that craft</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden boom,</v>

2275
01:34:26.351 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 1>they blow up and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2276
01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.170
<v Speaker 1>overnights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2277
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Comedy looks so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

2278
01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Because you're just talking like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking right now.</v>

2279
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do it in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>

2280
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Say funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how to talk and make a bicycle</v>

2281
01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.130
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways it's kind of been kind</v>

2282
01:34:40.131 --> 01:34:41.630
<v Speaker 1>of like running like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:43.620
<v Speaker 1>what is your running back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can run.</v>

2284
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:48.700
<v Speaker 1>He's got to catch the ball to catch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball problem would be the greatest ever.</v>

2285
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best at running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

2286
01:34:50.381 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>how are you the best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just add man.</v>

2287
01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I just my mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I know how to do it,</v>

2288
01:34:56.201 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to catch that ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>and run.</v>

2289
01:34:57.730 --> 01:34:58.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2290
01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I like this last like two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

2291
01:35:00.231 --> 01:35:00.771
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2292
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I've been going to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the laugh factory and comedy stores</v>

2293
01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:07.690
<v Speaker 2>and stuff or a comedy venues and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2294
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I just have a whole new respect for</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

2295
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 2>that shit is so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2296
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:15.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like you go to a venue and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just sitting in that chair,</v>

2297
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yo make me laugh.</v>

2298
01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys do it.</v>

2299
01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got so much respect for comedians.</v>

2300
01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2301
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Not only do it with chuck out our</v>
<v Speaker 2>material every two years.</v>

2302
01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I'm at right now.</v>

2303
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like four months in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2304
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>That's hard dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm working on shit.</v>

2305
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it's on rubber legs.</v>

2306
01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:37.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not so super solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2307
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:39.210
<v Speaker 2>some of it's solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have asked.</v>

2308
01:35:39.211 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the process?</v>

2309
01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think of jokes?</v>

2310
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Like do you sit down and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2311
01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally ignorant to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2312
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 2>do You sit down and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2313
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write funny shit today for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an hour or like,</v>

2314
01:35:51.161 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 2>or just randomly go throughout your day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2315
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:59.790
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a body man,</v>

2316
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:06.160
<v Speaker 3>that's the brazos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'll be tAlking about some talking</v>

2317
01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:09.010
<v Speaker 3>about some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the main process.</v>

2318
01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the process.</v>

2319
01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.660
<v Speaker 3>The other part of the process is sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2320
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2321
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:19.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe a sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about things like maybe just</v>

2322
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:22.570
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll watch a documentary to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch a documentary and sometimes I'll</v>

2323
01:36:22.571 --> 01:36:26.440
<v Speaker 3>watch it because I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's some material in this</v>

2324
01:36:26.441 --> 01:36:29.500
<v Speaker 3>subject and then sometimes I'll just sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in front of my computer or</v>

2325
01:36:29.501 --> 01:36:34.330
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll sit with a pad and a pen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a piece of paper or sometimes I'm</v>

2326
01:36:34.331 --> 01:36:36.300
<v Speaker 3>just in my car and an idea you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

2327
01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that gets me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2328
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:40.030
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to do because I like to,</v>

2329
01:36:40.210 --> 01:36:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I like to listen to shit when I'm in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

2330
01:36:41.951 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 3>but I find out when I don't listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit wanna just have the,</v>

2331
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:46.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound off.</v>

2332
01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:48.940
<v Speaker 3>No radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll come up with ideas because my mInd</v>

2333
01:36:48.941 --> 01:36:53.680
<v Speaker 3>is forced to think and then I'll write</v>
<v Speaker 3>those ideas down and then once you wrIte</v>

2334
01:36:53.681 --> 01:36:55.670
<v Speaker 3>those ideas down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any idea that you write down,</v>

2335
01:36:55.671 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 3>it was like a seed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2336
01:36:56.981 --> 01:37:00.040
<v Speaker 3>and then you try to water that seed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to get It to grow into something</v>

2337
01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:03.610
<v Speaker 3>that's viable and half of them don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever grow.</v>

2338
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:07.320
<v Speaker 3>At least if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like,</v>

2339
01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to write some jokes and be like,</v>

2340
01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:12.580
<v Speaker 3>let me see what these people go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>

2341
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:14.680
<v Speaker 3>you know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2342
01:37:14.681 --> 01:37:15.730
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2343
01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like knowing where to start is hard,</v>

2344
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:23.020
<v Speaker 3>but the key is to really just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once you start then you sort of</v>

2345
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.770
<v Speaker 3>chop it down like you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you write a bunch of shit down and</v>

2346
01:37:25.771 --> 01:37:28.000
<v Speaker 3>you're all this nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's something right there.</v>

2347
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And he'd take that little piece of It</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll put that on copy and paste</v>

2348
01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:33.130
<v Speaker 3>out on another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll start from scratch.</v>

2349
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:38.310
<v Speaker 3>So like I might write 1500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 words and then out of those words</v>

2350
01:37:38.831 --> 01:37:41.900
<v Speaker 3>is a paragraph there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe something in that paragraph and</v>

2351
01:37:41.901 --> 01:37:44.740
<v Speaker 3>then I'll pull that paragraph thrown in</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else and then maybe I'll go</v>

2352
01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:47.320
<v Speaker 3>back over that other 2000 words that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

2353
01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take and I'll do it with fresh eyes like</v>

2354
01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:55.800
<v Speaker 3>the next day and maybe a new thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that process that we don't that</v>

2355
01:37:55.801 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

2356
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have super respect for a man</v>

2357
01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2358
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun job though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2361
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't play football for almost 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2362
01:38:07.271 --> 01:38:10.510
<v Speaker 1>She gave up</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2363
01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.240

<v Speaker 1>you're so glad about that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your mind can get fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>aren't going well.</v>

2366

2369

<v Speaker 1>comedians are really kind of like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrators of our society and they kinda</v>

2370
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.150
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And that's why.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to do it just like as a bucket</v>

2377
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 1>list thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to try and say I'm not,</v>

2378
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be like a touring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to like retirement.</v>

2379
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at shit that's interesting</v>

2380
01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:57.540
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2381
01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna try it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comedians,</v>

2382
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 1>they get real upset about that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2383
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:01.541
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2385
01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.520
<v Speaker 1>these guys think they can do what we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2386
01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't feel like that at all.</v>

2387
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.350
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feelings totally opposite.</v>

2388
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely could definitely do it.</v>

2389
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure you're funny.</v>

2390
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody could do it if you're</v>

2391
01:39:18.001 --> 01:39:19.440
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're smart and you're funny and</v>

2392
01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start.</v>

2393
01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody starts from a different spot.</v>

2394
01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally funny.</v>

2395
01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I met some people like my friend eddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>bravo,</v>

2396
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I tried to talk him about doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it a bunch of times back in the</v>

2397
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just naturally funny.</v>

2398
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.620
<v Speaker 1>He just says funny shIt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees funny shit and I was like,</v>

2399
01:39:34.621 --> 01:39:35.790
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a comedian.</v>

2400
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.820
<v Speaker 1>You just never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could be hilarious because</v>

2401
01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:42.660
<v Speaker 1>he'll fucking have us client some nights</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ridiculous shit,</v>

2402
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's a matter of starting off with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one step and then you learn how to walk</v>

2403
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:50.430
<v Speaker 1>and then you learn how to run and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn how to run better</v>

2404
01:39:50.431 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to figure out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>

2405
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really the bunch.</v>

2406
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:55.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole path to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whether or not you're willing to</v>

2407
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 1>take that path because that path might</v>
<v Speaker 1>take 10 years.</v>

2408
01:39:58.050 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody says,</v>

2409
01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love good sets before those 10 years,</v>

2410
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:04.020
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like 10 years.</v>

2411
01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Then finally I got a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughs all along the way,</v>

2412
01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:09.030
<v Speaker 1>but I sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2413
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:11.820
<v Speaker 1>definitely kind of take you awhile to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out who you are as a,</v>

2414
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:14.640
<v Speaker 1>as a comic and then that's the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing though.</v>

2415
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:17.700
<v Speaker 1>You do a special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just did my last netflix special</v>

2416
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:18.490
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit with.</v>

2417
01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh thanks.</v>

2418
01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.790
<v Speaker 1>The dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2419
01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a true story.</v>

2420
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I fell out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2421
01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so high.</v>

2422
01:40:27.661 --> 01:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I was watching those dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2423
01:40:28.891 --> 01:40:31.060
<v Speaker 1>how come nobody ever catches dolphins on</v>
<v Speaker 1>official?</v>

2424
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh fucking smarter than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2425
01:40:33.181 --> 01:40:35.510
<v Speaker 1>We're filling with water people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started really,</v>

2426
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:39.230
<v Speaker 1>really made me think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it was gds.</v>

2427
01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:40.093
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2428
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 1>That was really something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about.</v>

2429
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a blog about it way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2430
01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called hello stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2431
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 1>About that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That very subject.</v>

2432
01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy man.</v>

2433
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Like yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2434
01:40:55.590 --> 01:41:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you find a way to like encapsulate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest and most brilliant thoughts</v>

2435
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:05.710
<v Speaker 1>that we have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is once you do one every two</v>

2436
01:41:05.711 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is you</v>

2437
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:08.830
<v Speaker 1>run out of shit to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2438
01:41:08.831 --> 01:41:09.341
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2439
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have necessarily anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

2440
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 1>but what I liked to do then when I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stagnant is I like to not do</v>

2441
01:41:15.311 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let my brain like reach its</v>

2442
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.610
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just come back.</v>

2443
01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:24.090
<v Speaker 1>You have ever just went on stage wIth no</v>
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>

2444
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.290
<v Speaker 1>winged it only on these shows that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2445
01:41:26.291 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 1>We have these shows called stand up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spot.</v>

2446
01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 1>My friend jeremiah watkins put on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show where you actually wing it to the</v>

2447
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:38.251
<v Speaker 1>audience of suggestion so the audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>will yell out like a a bushes paintings</v>

2448
01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>because George Bush paints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're seeing his painting not seen</v>

2449
01:41:41.871 --> 01:41:44.030
<v Speaker 1>as this nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are weird.</v>

2450
01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not bad.</v>

2451
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dope man.</v>

2452
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:47.163
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2453
01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:52.940
<v Speaker 1>don't know criminaLs or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can separate.</v>

2454
01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2455
01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explain that to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bill cosby and I was like,</v>

2456
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:03.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complex situation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

2457
01:42:03.341 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he most likely did those things that</v>

2458
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:09.130
<v Speaker 1>they're accusing him of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty likely.</v>

2459
01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Pretty like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2460
01:42:10.331 --> 01:42:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems highly unlikely that that</v>

2461
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:14.800
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was always that rumor,</v>

2462
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 1>there was always that rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also was a brilliant comedian who</v>

2463
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:20.730
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a rapist.</v>

2464
01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:23.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was a brilliant comedIan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alleged rapist,</v>

2465
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to got to say like,</v>

2466
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:26.141
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh jay,</v>

2467
01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:27.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2468
01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:29.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking murder a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like two could play.</v>

2469
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.440
<v Speaker 1>That was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was nice man,</v>

2470
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how people can't</v>

2471
01:42:35.231 --> 01:42:38.770
<v Speaker 1>separate your performance from you who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are as a human.</v>

2472
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I never understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the recent thing where his</v>

2473
01:42:41.351 --> 01:42:45.340
<v Speaker 1>doctor said that if the understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cte was available back then,</v>

2474
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 1>they might've used that as a defense as</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

2475
01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2476
01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.470
<v Speaker 1>what's really crazy is that doctor is</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially saying that jose oj did it</v>

2477
01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:55.560
<v Speaker 1>even though he was acquitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.150
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means jail for stealing and shit.</v>

2479
01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I know in that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might get out soon.</v>

2480
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who he is though.</v>

2481
01:43:00.991 --> 01:43:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like december.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has an opportunity,</v>

2482
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I think in october,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's one of those things</v>

2483
01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like a parole thing because I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in jail for 25 years,</v>

2484
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's been in jail for nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he might get released,</v>

2485
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 1>but is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says october,</v>

2486
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:19.210
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of know that they're not reaLly</v>

2487
01:43:19.211 --> 01:43:22.600
<v Speaker 1>jailing him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really jaylin him for that.</v>

2488
01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Which is weird that the the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was trying to get back his</v>

2489
01:43:26.561 --> 01:43:27.520
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2490
01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people don't know the story of oj,</v>

2491
01:43:31.421 --> 01:43:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe someone had stolen some of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>autographed merchandise or as</v>

2492
01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:40.150
<v Speaker 1>memorabilia and he was trying to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and someone in the room with them</v>

2493
01:43:40.151 --> 01:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>had a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy he went,</v>

2494
01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.840
<v Speaker 1>we held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They held them hostage.</v>

2495
01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 1>They pulled a gun out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they had it out,</v>

2496
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but I think what it was was they went</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the room with the people and lock</v>

2497
01:43:50.681 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the door and nobody's leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

2498
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.740
<v Speaker 4>like a kidnapping charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't kidnap people.</v>

2499
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy though,</v>

2500
01:43:56.121 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 4>that we're supposed to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what kept him in jail for nine</v>

2501
01:43:58.521 --> 01:44:00.350
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you definitely know because if you</v>

2502
01:44:00.351 --> 01:44:05.150
<v Speaker 4>watched the judges deliberation when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to jail them,</v>

2503
01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:08.230
<v Speaker 4>you could tell it was like we deserved</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

2504
01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you deserve this.</v>

2505
01:44:09.181 --> 01:44:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Like just throwing the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that was your first offense,</v>

2506
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.970
<v Speaker 4>you might not even be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2507
01:44:13.971 --> 01:44:16.390
<v Speaker 4>I kinda believe they're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give him parole on the.</v>

2508
01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:18.213
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2509
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:21.350
<v Speaker 4>I just got to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was so weird to me,</v>

2510
01:44:21.351 --> 01:44:22.660
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

2511
01:44:22.661 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a woman who was in the manson</v>

2512
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:26.750
<v Speaker 4>family who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2513
01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:30.800
<v Speaker 4>was one of the people that murdered</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharon Tate and she was up for parole</v>

2514
01:44:30.801 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 4>recently and they were talking to her</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were,</v>

2515
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asking her why she did it and how she</v>

2516
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:41.660
<v Speaker 4>did it and she just sort of explained</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she was a part of this call to and</v>

2517
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:44.840
<v Speaker 4>that they had really kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 4>convinced her that this was the way to</v>

2518
01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:46.730
<v Speaker 4>do it and this is the way to live.</v>

2519
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 4>We have to fight these people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all on acid.</v>

2520
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 4>They're all fucking freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was trying to explain it and</v>

2521
01:44:51.621 --> 01:44:52.340
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2522
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:57.340
<v Speaker 4>no parole</v>
<v Speaker 4>explaining how she stabbed her and the</v>

2523
01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:59.930
<v Speaker 4>woman was pregnant too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to have the baby.</v>

2524
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:05.620
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just crazy that some people go to</v>

2525
01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:08.900
<v Speaker 4>jail for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for stupid shit.</v>

2526
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Like smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people that are in jail for</v>

2527
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 4>selling pot in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in jail with life sentences.</v>

2528
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:16.380
<v Speaker 4>It must have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2529
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you people have died in jail</v>
<v Speaker 4>for marijuana sales.</v>

2530
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guaranteed.</v>

2531
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:27.010
<v Speaker 4>But It's still of kind of possible that</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you tell somebody you could get out</v>

2532
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:29.140
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2533
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.410
<v Speaker 4>It's a depends on who you are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2534
01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.690
<v Speaker 4>it must.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2535
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:35.960
<v Speaker 4>it also depends on the overcrowding of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the state,</v>

2536
01:45:35.961 --> 01:45:37.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone was telling me that a</v>

2537
01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:39.950
<v Speaker 4>Louisiana in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2538
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:45.190
<v Speaker 4>during new orleans during katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather like when new orleans was getting</v>

2539
01:45:45.741 --> 01:45:48.080
<v Speaker 4>flooded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend was like,</v>

2540
01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.240
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had what they would call,</v>

2541
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like instead of felt they would call it</v>

2542
01:45:53.841 --> 01:45:58.841
<v Speaker 4>misdemeanor murder as a joke because</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes would be murdering guys and they'd</v>

2543
01:45:59.391 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 4>be out in really short sentences because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just haven't heard about.</v>

2544
01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.510
<v Speaker 4>I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2545
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 4>see if you could pull up that term</v>
<v Speaker 4>misdemeanor murder neW orleans,</v>

2546
01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 4>because like this guy was joking around</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and I didn't.</v>

2547
01:46:10.071 --> 01:46:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I never looked into it deep enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>know whether it was telling the truth,</v>

2548
01:46:12.621 --> 01:46:16.070
<v Speaker 4>but I had heard it more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just letting people out.</v>

2549
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2550
01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2551
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:23.210
<v Speaker 4>New orleans often accuses</v>
<v Speaker 4>institutionalized missy misdemeanor</v>

2552
01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:24.450
<v Speaker 4>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Article seven.</v>

2553
01:46:24.451 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the criminal code requires the</v>

2554
01:46:25.971 --> 01:46:28.430
<v Speaker 4>state release.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A defendant who has not been charged</v>

2555
01:46:28.431 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 4>with a crime after 60 days before</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurricane katrina,</v>

2556
01:46:31.521 --> 01:46:35.870
<v Speaker 4>a few hundred people per year were</v>
<v Speaker 4>released under article seven slash 11,</v>

2557
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 4>so someone who committed murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't be charged inside of 60</v>

2558
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:42.080
<v Speaker 4>days because they probably overburdened</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they would let someone out.</v>

2559
01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.530
<v Speaker 4>Holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>

2560
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 4>The big easy to get away with murder</v>
<v Speaker 4>metal filler article.</v>

2561
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2562
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:57.771
<v Speaker 4>so some spots it's just so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaotic in a way with the people in</v>

2563
01:46:57.841 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 4>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in prison for petty offenses.</v>

2564
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:04.800
<v Speaker 4>Drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still they are violating our rules.</v>

2565
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have too many rules.</v>

2566
01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that many people are in jail for</v>

2567
01:47:09.181 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 4>violating rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that necessarily mean that many</v>

2568
01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 4>people should be in jail or does it mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have too many roles,</v>

2569
01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 4>but you got to figure out like if</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone is a victim of these situations</v>

2570
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 4>is so as soon as someone's a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's probably where we should</v>

2571
01:47:21.211 --> 01:47:22.400
<v Speaker 4>serve and protect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2572
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how people,</v>

2573
01:47:24.490 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>view our laws as the gospel.</v>

2574
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things obviously are</v>

2575
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.780
<v Speaker 2>demonstrably bad for society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some shit like this is such a,</v>

2576
01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:37.861
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2577
01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that could be amended</v>

2578
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:40.610
<v Speaker 2>that just needed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2579
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.600
<v Speaker 2>What would you change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you could,</v>

2580
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.790
<v Speaker 2>if you could geT into the judicial</v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

2581
01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2582
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:50.830
<v Speaker 4>well for the drugs there is no way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be first.</v>

2583
01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the big ones.</v>

2584
01:47:52.151 --> 01:47:53.260
<v Speaker 4>The first one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the big ones.</v>

2585
01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else?</v>

2586
01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:56.853
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2587
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:02.200
<v Speaker 2>oh no ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to deliberate on now.</v>

2588
01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2589
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 2>the prison industrial complex as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a locking up people of color has been a</v>

2590
01:48:09.941 --> 01:48:12.250
<v Speaker 2>problem in our communities for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2591
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that the policing needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2592
01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.210
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think if you're going to look at</v>

2593
01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.130
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we juSt got done talking about</v>

2594
01:48:22.131 --> 01:48:23.510
<v Speaker 4>this yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think if you're going to look at</v>

2595
01:48:23.511 --> 01:48:26.960
<v Speaker 4>other parts of the world saying they</v>
<v Speaker 4>need our help places like Afghanistan</v>

2596
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:31.580
<v Speaker 4>where we've sent massive amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>troops and resources into Iraq in</v>

2597
01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:32.503
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2598
01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I think if they put that amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figuring out how to build back these</v>

2599
01:48:37.610 --> 01:48:39.480
<v Speaker 4>impoverished communities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2600
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:41.210
<v Speaker 4>instead of just leaving them the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

2601
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bad.</v>

2602
01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:44.330
<v Speaker 4>Figure out some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck it is mean</v>

2603
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:47.690
<v Speaker 4>because you'd have to like go through a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of generations to get rid of the</v>

2604
01:48:47.691 --> 01:48:51.050
<v Speaker 4>cycle of the negativity that some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people have experienced growing up</v>

2605
01:48:51.051 --> 01:48:54.110
<v Speaker 4>with all the crime and all the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>PoverTy all the time.</v>

2606
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right there together.</v>

2607
01:48:55.311 --> 01:48:58.810
<v Speaker 4>And then also the momentum of that crime</v>
<v Speaker 4>and poverty just,</v>

2608
01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:02.690
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to break loose of and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't help by putting them in jail or</v>

2609
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:03.680
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

2610
01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.490
<v Speaker 2>becomes a mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I always found a significant</v>

2611
01:49:07.491 --> 01:49:10.190
<v Speaker 2>like kind of growing up like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inner city,</v>

2612
01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:14.300
<v Speaker 2>like so like violence is so normalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2613
01:49:14.301 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being,</v>

2614
01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.400
<v Speaker 2>like being who you like being tough on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the streets was like the good thing to</v>

2615
01:49:21.501 --> 01:49:25.830
<v Speaker 2>be growing up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you've heard of somebody like it</v>

2616
01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:29.300
<v Speaker 2>says committed murders or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or beaten up people or whatever like</v>

2617
01:49:29.301 --> 01:49:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2618
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 2>and this is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that,</v>

2619
01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.820
<v Speaker 2>that mentality it reverberates through</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the neighborhoods is like that's</v>

2620
01:49:34.821 --> 01:49:36.560
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what you want it to be,</v>

2621
01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.300
<v Speaker 2>not you don't want to kill people but</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want it to be,</v>

2622
01:49:38.301 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 2>to have that tough label and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mentality and that site,</v>

2623
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.880
<v Speaker 2>their psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's infectious.</v>

2624
01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:45.540
<v Speaker 2>And you sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you see it with,</v>

2625
01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:47.210
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with music and entertainment,</v>

2626
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2627
01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's embedded in our</v>

2628
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 1>and our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started way back then but it's</v>

2629
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 1>still hEre and it seems like it ramped</v>
<v Speaker 1>up when it became a big part of a</v>

2630
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>popular rap culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was a kid,</v>

2631
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>there was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't hEar about nearly as much</v>

2632
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:08.641
<v Speaker 1>gang violence as we did after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nwa came out when you started</v>

2633
01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:11.460
<v Speaker 1>hearing rap music with a lot of violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

2634
01:50:11.690 --> 01:50:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That they were the originators of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2636
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the violence in the neighborhoods,</v>

2637
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:20.140
<v Speaker 1>they really didn't start with the rap</v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

2638
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Started with the crack era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the rat very came out of the crack</v>

2639
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:25.900
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all came together.</v>

2640
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:26.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

2641
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2642
01:50:28.981 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is a really good point too,</v>

2643
01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:33.580
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all sudden it glorified it and it</v>

2644
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of wannabes and that's true.</v>

2645
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean it's,</v>

2646
01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I love art.</v>

2647
01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Art is always a reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mirror of society,</v>

2648
01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you go to that lacma place,</v>

2649
01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you ever go that la county museum of art</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never seen him don't go.</v>

2650
01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the modern places where they</v>

2651
01:50:53.171 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 1>have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a box on the ground.</v>

2652
01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.060
<v Speaker 1>It was like a plexiglass box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2653
01:50:58.061 --> 01:51:00.280
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that that's the actual art,</v>

2654
01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 1>the plexiglass box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the box represents what you want</v>

2655
01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 1>it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The art looked down at the box.</v>

2656
01:51:08.921 --> 01:51:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really brilliant actually when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it that way because the box</v>

2657
01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.040
<v Speaker 1>ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2658
01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a box.</v>

2659
01:51:15.971 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>

2660
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a dude who you buy weed off of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his coffee table,</v>

2661
01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2662
01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.170
<v Speaker 1>You go over his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2663
01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this fucking amber plastic coffee</v>

2664
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:26.110
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got bro.</v>

2665
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2666
01:51:27.490 --> 01:51:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I fucking chop my buds up on this band</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a nice tent though.</v>

2667
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad,</v>

2668
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:36.280
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it was roped off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was an actual.</v>

2669
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It's an actual piece of exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece of art.</v>

2670
01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never have got it.</v>

2671
01:51:41.801 --> 01:51:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2672
01:51:44.261 --> 01:51:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone else that's funded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funded.</v>

2673
01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it like who funds that?</v>

2674
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Who funds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a big part of it is public.</v>

2675
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It's the la county museum of national</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

2676
01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

2677
01:51:55.121 --> 01:51:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Because what it represents a spaghetti</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we all liked spaghetti.</v>

2678
01:51:59.050 --> 01:52:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think about your child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2679
01:52:01.301 --> 01:52:02.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2680
01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.790
<v Speaker 1>What did you like string hanging from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling?</v>

2681
01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2683
01:52:05.921 --> 01:52:08.680

<v Speaker 1>from back when I was a kid.</v>

2684
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 1>When you had to rent porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go through beads,</v>

2685
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:14.840
<v Speaker 1>like to get to the porno section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my era,</v>

2686
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:17.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way older than umass.</v>

2687
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I was there when it all went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see everybody,</v>

2688
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:22.810

<v Speaker 1>A rock there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an rps?</v>

2691
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 1>The la lacma thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an a rock and it represents</v>

2692
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:37.610
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not appreciate how they got the rock.</v>

2693
01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:41.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't because this guy could have paid</v>

2694
01:52:41.501 --> 01:52:44.590
<v Speaker 1>for a fucking teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bunch of shit.</v>

2695
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>We just hired a better</v>

2696
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:49.920
<v Speaker 4>group of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of coaches for a football team.</v>

2697
01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do?</v>

2698
01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 4>I liked that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why it's there.</v>

2699
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:55.520
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the world's all different,</v>

2700
01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 4>like hot food tastes different to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it does to some folks.</v>

2701
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 4>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people looked at that and it goes,</v>

2702
01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:04.270
<v Speaker 4>it's hazing and they got this feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could just look at him.</v>

2703
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:06.800
<v Speaker 4>I can appreciate somebody pulling that</v>
<v Speaker 4>rock there.</v>

2704
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 4>Somebody might've even looked at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>box on the ground and got that feeling.</v>

2705
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not denying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd have to explain that one to me,</v>

2706
01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 4>whether they'd be like with this is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2707
01:53:14.290 --> 01:53:16.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything is so defined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2708
01:53:16.411 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 4>And when you read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the words are in the order.</v>

2709
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:21.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're thinking about what this</v>

2710
01:53:21.171 --> 01:53:22.550
<v Speaker 4>person wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wrote it.</v>

2711
01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're forcing this into your mind.</v>

2712
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:27.320
<v Speaker 4>So this artist is giving the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2713
01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 4>This is giving you the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>put inside that box or to whatever,</v>

2714
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:34.570
<v Speaker 4>put whatever signification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2715
01:53:34.590 --> 01:53:37.130
<v Speaker 4>whatever important significance of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>box.</v>

2716
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 4>It's all up to your interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2717
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Speaker 4>She has a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why she.</v>

2718
01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she might.</v>

2719
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.430
<v Speaker 4>She's transitioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She seemed like she was transitioning</v>

2720
01:53:46.431 --> 01:53:48.000
<v Speaker 4>while I was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2721
01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 4>I lost my girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started out as a girl and then I got</v>

2722
01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:53.650
<v Speaker 4>annoyed and I became a gay guy for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little while at the end.</v>

2723
01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 4>That was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old lady who smoked cigarettes</v>

2724

01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:50.280
<v Speaker 4>So snotty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many people that were snoball</v>

2742
01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.110
<v Speaker 4>taxpayers have last name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2743
01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:56.890
<v Speaker 4>well</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disagree with your fucking schools in</v>

2744
01:54:56.891 --> 01:54:59.000
<v Speaker 4>la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about what teachers get paid.</v>

2745
01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Think about cops lacmas most reliable</v>
<v Speaker 4>patrons,</v>

2746
01:55:02.421 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 4>10 million taxpayers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I guess people can sign up and give</v>

2747
01:55:06.081 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 4>money if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being around on the weirdos.</v>

2748
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:10.340
<v Speaker 4>But here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those weirdos,</v>

2749
01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:12.650
<v Speaker 4>man to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool when they go there,</v>

2750
01:55:12.651 --> 01:55:13.650
<v Speaker 4>they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2751
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:16.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just because,</v>

2752
01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:18.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you a weirdo?</v>

2753
01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:22.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware I'm an idiot because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you looking at that</v>

2754
01:55:22.071 --> 01:55:25.400
<v Speaker 4>plastic box in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't appreciate a bunch of people that</v>

2755
01:55:25.401 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a question for you man.</v>

2756
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2757
01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:31.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been a fan of you for a long time,</v>

2758
01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:32.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what?</v>

2759
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate it.</v>

2760
01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:35.480
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Appreciate what,</v>

2761
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Made you make this switch from like</v>

2762
01:55:39.361 --> 01:55:44.020
<v Speaker 4>being a moon landing denier to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy if we didn't.</v>

2763
01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're crazy.</v>

2764
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:46.801
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

2765
01:55:46.801 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 3>This is my take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2766
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about space travel,</v>

2767
01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 3>about the science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the work that's been done about</v>

2768
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:02.280
<v Speaker 3>how to get a rock rocket to the moon and</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2769
01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's rocket science and I've looked at</v>

2770
01:56:06.690 --> 01:56:11.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of very compelling documentaries</v>
<v Speaker 3>that explain why they think it was</v>

2771
01:56:12.001 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 3>hoaxed and they'll show you some footage</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can look at some of the footage</v>

2772
01:56:16.321 --> 01:56:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and it looks fake as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some footage that to me looks</v>

2773
01:56:19.591 --> 01:56:22.410
<v Speaker 3>really doctored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some delay yet to this day.</v>

2774
01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Some guy would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you ever seen ones where it looks</v>

2775
01:56:24.751 --> 01:56:27.060
<v Speaker 3>like they're on wire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to astronauts are on wires.</v>

2776
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's somewhere.</v>

2777
01:56:29.311 --> 01:56:31.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a video where they look at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own trampoline there,</v>

2778
01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.880
<v Speaker 3>bounced around on trampolines.</v>

2779
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 3>The physics are different in different</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

2780
01:56:35.821 --> 01:56:38.610
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the physics are different from the</v>

2781
01:56:38.611 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 3>apollo 11 moon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see them waddle around on the surface</v>

2782
01:56:41.701 --> 01:56:44.760
<v Speaker 3>of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moving it like half speed and then</v>

2783
01:56:44.761 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 3>you see them in other ones like the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they bounce around the area,</v>

2784
01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:50.850
<v Speaker 3>like they're moving different during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>

2785
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 3>but it looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one was very grainy.</v>

2786
01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:58.341
<v Speaker 3>They showed it on a projection screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's a.</v>

2787
01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple different</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>

2788
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:06.270
<v Speaker 3>One possibility is it just looks weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's on the moon and your brain</v>

2789
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:07.860
<v Speaker 3>is trying to interpret it and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain's going,</v>

2790
01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:09.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fake because you don't really</v>

2791
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:12.890
<v Speaker 3>understand with one six ers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravity really does to a body of.</v>

2792
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 3>That's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another possibility,</v>

2793
01:57:15.991 --> 01:57:20.991
<v Speaker 3>which has been shown to be true is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the stuff that they passed off</v>

2794
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:26.570
<v Speaker 3>as being legitimate photographs of space</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel was actually test runs where they</v>

2795
01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:31.890
<v Speaker 3>blacked out the background and pretended</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were in space and there's one</v>

2796
01:57:31.891 --> 01:57:34.800
<v Speaker 3>really clear example of this is Michael</v>
<v Speaker 3>Collins,</v>

2797
01:57:34.801 --> 01:57:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a guy who was a board apollo 11</v>

2798
01:57:37.530 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 3>and jim and I 15.</v>

2799
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:44.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a photo of him in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sea of.</v>

2800
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:47.160
<v Speaker 3>What is it when they walk around outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the space,</v>

2801
01:57:47.290 --> 01:57:49.620
<v Speaker 3>these facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that seem like a bad word?</v>

2802
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:51.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like spacewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it doesn't seem like that's the</v>

2803
01:57:51.751 --> 01:57:55.140
<v Speaker 3>official title is the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spacewalk probably something more.</v>

2804
01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 3>A little more syllables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2805
01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:58.770
<v Speaker 3>something slicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2806
01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:02.160
<v Speaker 3>so he's doing the space walk and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got this harness on is holding onto this</v>

2807
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:07.760
<v Speaker 3>thing and it was apparently just an</v>
<v Speaker 3>image that had already been published,</v>

2808
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:13.070
<v Speaker 3>have him in a training exercise and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacked out the background and flipped</v>

2809
01:58:13.071 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 3>the picture upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So same exact photo,</v>

2810
01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:19.320
<v Speaker 3>same exact photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people have lined it up and</v>

2811
01:58:19.321 --> 01:58:21.190
<v Speaker 3>switched it over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same photo.</v>

2812
01:58:21.191 --> 01:58:25.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just been edited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the one on the left was them</v>

2813
01:58:25.891 --> 01:58:28.670
<v Speaker 3>practicing how to use these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get that.</v>

2814
01:58:28.730 --> 01:58:31.290
<v Speaker 3>The harness is some sort of a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hanging onto it.</v>

2815
01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess it moves them around a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

2816
01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.060
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to practice it on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left and the right.</v>

2817
01:58:36.061 --> 01:58:38.640
<v Speaker 3>They just pass it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those are publicity photos.</v>

2818
01:58:38.641 --> 01:58:39.474
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

2819
01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.351
<v Speaker 3>So you got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2820
01:58:40.351 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well who approves the publicity photos?</v>

2821
01:58:42.371 --> 01:58:47.371
<v Speaker 3>It could easily be just some idiot who</v>
<v Speaker 3>works in the publicity department who</v>

2822
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 3>didn't marketing and who didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had enough photos from the moon</v>

2823
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:54.190
<v Speaker 3>that we're good of spacewalks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably insanely difficult to take</v>

2824
01:58:54.191 --> 01:58:57.520
<v Speaker 3>a spacewalk photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does that mean that they faked the</v>

2825
01:58:57.521 --> 01:58:58.450
<v Speaker 3>moon landing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2826
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 3>but it means that people fake things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to throw it,</v>

2827
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:03.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be really objective and looking</v>

2828
01:59:03.031 --> 01:59:04.000
<v Speaker 3>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2829
01:59:04.450 --> 01:59:09.450
<v Speaker 3>So people say fake things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely filmed a lot of the um,</v>

2830
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:13.540
<v Speaker 3>the training exercises that they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the moon landing.</v>

2831
01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:16.450
<v Speaker 3>They filmed a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely did.</v>

2832
01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:22.680
<v Speaker 3>If that is already been proven that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>took this fake photograph and they tried</v>

2833
01:59:23.801 --> 01:59:25.540
<v Speaker 3>to pass it off as a real space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2834
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:29.050
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that they filmed,</v>

2835
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:33.130
<v Speaker 3>they made out to look like they were on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon when they were not.</v>

2836
01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:36.280
<v Speaker 3>But does that mean they didn't go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon?</v>

2837
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:37.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

2838
01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:40.990
<v Speaker 3>And so when I was saying it proves that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go to the moon,</v>

2839
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my critique of myself is that I didn't</v>

2840
01:59:46.931 --> 01:59:50.980
<v Speaker 3>look at it objectively because I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>one conclusion to be true and I wanted</v>

2841
01:59:50.981 --> 01:59:52.960
<v Speaker 3>that conclusion to be that the moon</v>
<v Speaker 3>landing was fake.</v>

2842
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.260
<v Speaker 3>So I looked at it and I Was and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying to myself,</v>

2843
01:59:56.590 --> 01:59:59.230
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did I come to this conclusion because</v>

2844
01:59:59.231 --> 02:00:02.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of evidence that shows it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be fake or have I seen a lot of</v>

2845
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 3>evidence that looks fake and does that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that they didn't go to the moon?</v>

2846
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:06.903
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

2847
02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.440
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of different</v>

2848
02:00:08.441 --> 02:00:10.750
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of different</v>

2849
02:00:10.751 --> 02:00:12.910
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also the possibility that</v>

2850
02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.710
<v Speaker 3>whatever photographs they took can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>severely damaged in the radiation of</v>

2851
02:00:17.711 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 3>space and it was really difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2852
02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.980
<v Speaker 3>That's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that they decided somehow or another</v>

2853
02:00:23.981 --> 02:00:28.600
<v Speaker 3>that they were going to pass off these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they actually did go and they're</v>

2854
02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:31.570
<v Speaker 3>deciding they're going to pass off some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these fake videos.</v>

2855
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.440
<v Speaker 3>So there's a bunch of possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The possibility that it looks fake</v>

2856
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:39.670
<v Speaker 3>because I'm dumb and because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand anything about the physics of</v>

2857
02:00:39.671 --> 02:00:43.280
<v Speaker 3>one six earth's gravity and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks weird because it's shitty film in</v>

2858
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:45.970
<v Speaker 3>1969.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's possibility number one.</v>

2859
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Number two is they fake some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or number three is they didn't really</v>

2860
02:00:50.861 --> 02:00:55.530
<v Speaker 3>have good footage because like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't take film through the airport,</v>

2861
02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:58.650
<v Speaker 3>remember that like people would go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through those right radar detectors and</v>

2862
02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:00.460
<v Speaker 3>you're filming get jacked and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

2863
02:01:00.461 --> 02:01:01.760
<v Speaker 3>weren't responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't use film.</v>

2864
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:03.400
<v Speaker 3>But I know people that might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2865
02:01:03.401 --> 02:01:06.520
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that are photographers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2866
02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.680
<v Speaker 3>my uncle's a photographer and he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me,</v>

2867
02:01:08.681 --> 02:01:12.510
<v Speaker 3>you can't send the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have like you've taken a</v>

2868
02:01:12.511 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 3>roll of film and the awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2869
02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:20.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that some film has been</v>

2870
02:01:20.201 --> 02:01:23.690
<v Speaker 3>damaged or maybe it's an urban myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe would find out.</v>

2871
02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Film got damaged by a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those radar things in the air force.</v>

2872
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:31.740
<v Speaker 3>X-rays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ex-rays theory.</v>

2873
02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I could appreciate the mindset though of</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at your opinion objective,</v>

2874
02:01:36.011 --> 02:01:36.820
<v Speaker 3>lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying,</v>

2875
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:39.830
<v Speaker 3>am I tripping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's look at the facts and say,</v>

2876
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the problem with people</v>

2877
02:01:42.441 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 4>today when people in period is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid to say,</v>

2878
02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:47.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YoU know what I mean?</v>

2879
02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 4>They're super afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2880
02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:51.350
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorance is such a gift,</v>

2881
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:54.710
<v Speaker 4>like it just gives you an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn some shit if you're humble enough,</v>

2882
02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 4>like don't assume you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the shit I feel like I know I still</v>

2883
02:01:57.921 --> 02:01:59.420
<v Speaker 4>feel like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2884
02:01:59.421 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Well that seems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a very healthy ego for a big</v>

2885
02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 4>young fucking super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking fucking football man.</v>

2886
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Like no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying he goes very healthy.</v>

2887
02:02:09.570 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 4>You have a really good way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2888
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:14.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the right way to be mad</v>
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>

2889
02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.220
<v Speaker 4>You can't be married to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like ideas and opinions like that</v>

2890
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:21.680
<v Speaker 4>because they're not you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we think that they are.</v>

2891
02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.710
<v Speaker 4>They're like an extension of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we want to win these arguments.</v>

2892
02:02:24.711 --> 02:02:28.490
<v Speaker 4>That's why we want to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it gets real scary when you want</v>

2893
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:30.770
<v Speaker 4>to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're willing to ignore</v>

2894
02:02:30.771 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 4>evidence that might show that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

2895
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:35.720
<v Speaker 4>That's how I felt about myself and by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way,</v>

2896
02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.120
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to see if you wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy,</v>

2897
02:02:38.121 --> 02:02:40.880
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems like it might be possible.</v>

2898
02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 4>The moon landings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best ones,</v>

2899
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:48.070
<v Speaker 4>and this is why it's so attractive</v>
<v Speaker 4>between 1969 in 1973.</v>

2900
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 4>He's still on the fence about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

2901
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2902
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:53.770
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not enough.</v>

2903
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know shit fence.</v>

2904
02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.390
<v Speaker 4>That's where I lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but between the facts on this side.</v>

2905
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm with you though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sent,</v>

2906
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.890
<v Speaker 4>I think it was seven mission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six of them were successful.</v>

2907
02:03:03.891 --> 02:03:06.110
<v Speaker 4>The only one that wasn't successful as</v>
<v Speaker 4>apollo 13.</v>

2908
02:03:06.170 --> 02:03:08.750
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sent these fucking people around</v>

2909
02:03:08.751 --> 02:03:11.630
<v Speaker 4>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred 50,000 plus miles out there</v>

2910
02:03:11.690 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 4>and back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ever since then all they've been</v>

2911
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:18.800
<v Speaker 4>able to do is get people into near earth</v>
<v Speaker 4>orbit ever since then,</v>

2912
02:03:18.801 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 4>like the highest anyone's ever gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it'S 400 miles,</v>

2913
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:26.770
<v Speaker 4>so they went from 260,000 miles all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to the moon and back to 400 miles.</v>

2914
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Everything iS like inside and they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>never gone through the van.</v>

2915
02:03:31.491 --> 02:03:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Allen radiation belts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never got into deep space and return.</v>

2916
02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.400
<v Speaker 4>They haven't done that since 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60,</v>

2917
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:37.940
<v Speaker 4>1973.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2918
02:03:37.941 --> 02:03:39.770
<v Speaker 4>and I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought it was because of like</v>

2919
02:03:39.771 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 4>funding could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know we not lacmas got</v>

2920
02:03:43.131 --> 02:03:44.540
<v Speaker 4>funds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show me,</v>

2921
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.180
<v Speaker 4>show me how that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to fund space travel.</v>

2922
02:03:47.181 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 4>You want to fund that fucking acrylic</v>
<v Speaker 4>box or box editor by the way.</v>

2923
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:54.590
<v Speaker 4>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is great.</v>

2924
02:03:54.591 --> 02:03:55.910
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2925
02:03:56.510 --> 02:04:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that I know whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went to the moon,</v>

2926
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:04.670
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you that if you wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 4>juicy conspiracy to get excited about,</v>

2927
02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 4>I've looked into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the best one to get excited about.</v>

2928
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:11.390
<v Speaker 4>I lost all the data I see because I see</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2929
02:04:11.690 --> 02:04:13.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go down to youtube wormhole and you</v>

2930
02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:19.540
<v Speaker 4>start watching barry sanders highlight</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm looking at a jfk being</v>

2931
02:04:19.641 --> 02:04:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jackson and it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I,</v>

2932
02:04:23.690 --> 02:04:24.210
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2933
02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:27.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't see what the motive would</v>

2934
02:04:27.261 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 4>be like what is the fucking cold war?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2935
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Speaker 4>we wanted to beat the russians because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were in a race to see who didn't get</v>

2936
02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:37.100
<v Speaker 4>to the moon and here's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we do know for a fact.</v>

2937
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 4>The russians faked</v>

2938
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They faked a bunch of footage.</v>

2939
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yuri gagarin,</v>

2940
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 3>who's the first man in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a video,</v>

2941
02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:46.580
<v Speaker 3>might be an expert on this man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there.</v>

2942
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied this.</v>

2943
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:49.770
<v Speaker 3>I debated a guy who was a really nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2944
02:04:49.771 --> 02:04:53.970
<v Speaker 3>but I'm phil plait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a bad astronomer?</v>

2945
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Astronomer.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2946
02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2947
02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 3>he was a lot of thIngs he wasn't willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to admit though that were unfortunate</v>

2948
02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 3>because maybe he could have convinced me</v>
<v Speaker 3>more if he was.</v>

2949
02:05:02.371 --> 02:05:05.670
<v Speaker 3>And one of the big ones was that warner</v>
<v Speaker 3>von braun was a nazi.</v>

2950
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:08.730
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hIred a bunch of nazis to,</v>

2951
02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:12.810
<v Speaker 3>to run the space program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was called operation paperclip and</v>

2952
02:05:12.811 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 3>what operation paperclip was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they took a bunch of nazi</v>

2953
02:05:15.571 --> 02:05:17.850
<v Speaker 3>scientists and relocated them to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

2954
02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 3>We lost some of them to Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia scooped up some of them.</v>

2955
02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.200
<v Speaker 3>But when we ended the world war ii and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nazi Germany collapsed,</v>

2956
02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.600
<v Speaker 3>we went in and took the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

2957
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:31.920
<v Speaker 3>wernher von braun was the head of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocket factory in,</v>

2958
02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:32.813
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2959
02:05:33.450 --> 02:05:38.450
<v Speaker 3>in berlin where these to hang the five</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow as jews in front of the rocket</v>

2960
02:05:39.121 --> 02:05:43.110
<v Speaker 3>factory for all the other workers to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>warner von braun,</v>

2961
02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:46.590
<v Speaker 3>the simon wIesenthal center said if</v>
<v Speaker 3>wernher von braun was alive today,</v>

2962
02:05:46.591 --> 02:05:48.630
<v Speaker 3>he'd be punished for crimes against</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

2963
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.790
<v Speaker 3>This is news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2964
02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 3>wernher von braun was a straight up nazi</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy was not willing to admit</v>

2965
02:05:56.311 --> 02:05:57.144
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2967
02:05:58.021 --> 02:05:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because someone's in Germany.</v>

2968

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2970
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:00.181
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2971
02:06:00.181 --> 02:06:01.340
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a nazi.</v>

2972
02:06:01.690 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He was a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there any actually killed anybody?</v>

2973
02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe had to be a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2974
02:06:06.151 --> 02:06:07.290
<v Speaker 3>we're not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2975
02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:11.310
<v Speaker 3>if you're fucked and you're in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and that it overcomes the</v>

2976
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:13.140
<v Speaker 3>entire neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to keep your family alive.</v>

2977
02:06:13.141 --> 02:06:14.260
<v Speaker 3>So you put that thing on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2978
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.310
<v Speaker 3>your jacket sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put that swastika on and you see a</v>

2979
02:06:17.311 --> 02:06:20.700
<v Speaker 3>guy like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're not really a nazi.</v>

2980
02:06:20.701 --> 02:06:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Ideologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're not seeing your heart,</v>

2981
02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:25.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe just trying to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's entirely possible too,</v>

2982
02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but he was a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking nazi and they had</v>

2983
02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:34.470
<v Speaker 3>slaves that were running rocket</v>
<v Speaker 3>factories in berlin where they were</v>

2984
02:06:34.471 --> 02:06:36.210
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to make rockets.</v>

2985
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:38.580
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brandon,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2988
02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Operation paperclip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold war president truman authorized</v>

2989
02:06:44.641 --> 02:06:49.641
<v Speaker 3>operation paperclip in august of 1945.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The us army secretly admitted 88 german</v>

2990
02:06:49.801 --> 02:06:53.130
<v Speaker 3>scientists and engineers to help the</v>
<v Speaker 3>development of rocket technology,</v>

2991
02:06:53.131 --> 02:06:55.920
<v Speaker 3>including wernher von braun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthur rudolph,</v>

2992
02:06:56.070 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 3>and her buttocks struggled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her berkus,</v>

2993
02:06:59.830 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 3>her roberta's hubertus ubertis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great name.</v>

2994
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:04.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring that back.</v>

2995
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 3>If you have a fucking stud kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of the strongest men in</v>

2996
02:07:08.161 --> 02:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is hugh bertis.</v>

2997
02:07:10.590 --> 02:07:12.530
<v Speaker 3>My you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2998
02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 3>was named after announcing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was like something in the debate</v>

2999
02:07:18.481 --> 02:07:22.530
<v Speaker 3>that guy was not willing to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which made me even more skeptical that</v>

3000
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:27.030
<v Speaker 3>he was right about the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing was that they like and</v>

3001
02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 3>moon rocks that they've collected from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon have turned out to not really</v>

3002
02:07:31.411 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 3>be moon rocks like a bunch of them for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure have been tested by scientists and</v>

3003
02:07:35.921 --> 02:07:39.010
<v Speaker 3>they found that these rocks are from</v>
<v Speaker 3>another planet.</v>

3004
02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a rock that thEy gave to</v>

3005
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:47.670
<v Speaker 3>whoever's the head of holland and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>personally given with a plaque by neil</v>

3006
02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:49.870
<v Speaker 3>armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzz aldrin,</v>

3007
02:07:49.871 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 3>and Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it turned out to be petrified.</v>

3008
02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:58.051
<v Speaker 3>Wood moon rock given to holland by neil</v>
<v Speaker 3>armstrong and buzz aldrin is fake.</v>

3009
02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a moon rock given to the dutch</v>
<v Speaker 3>prime minister by the apollo 11</v>

3010
02:08:02.681 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 3>astronauts in 1969 turned out to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>

3011
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 3>So they were giving people pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 3>petrified wood saying,</v>

3012
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:11.110
<v Speaker 3>this is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the moon.</v>

3013
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:13.880
<v Speaker 3>God bless America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing 300,</v>

3014
02:08:14.090 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 3>8,000 euros.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a bunch of possibilities.</v>

3015
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just be honest about this because</v>

3016
02:08:20.891 --> 02:08:24.340
<v Speaker 3>this story's from 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that between</v>

3017
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:26.590
<v Speaker 3>1,969 that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3018
02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:28.240
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's multiple sources,</v>

3019
02:08:28.241 --> 02:08:32.410
<v Speaker 3>but that's the telegraph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a legit news source for sure.</v>

3020
02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.160
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that it's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that someone stole that moon</v>

3021
02:08:36.161 --> 02:08:38.050
<v Speaker 3>rock and replaced with that.</v>

3022
02:08:38.290 --> 02:08:39.910
<v Speaker 3>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's possible,</v>

3023
02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:43.270
<v Speaker 3>or as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just had some fake rocks.</v>

3024
02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill clinton had a fucking.</v>

3025
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:49.540
<v Speaker 3>He had a quote in his book in one of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>

3026
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.460
<v Speaker 3>I think his book is called my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had a quote about the moon</v>

3027
02:08:54.461 --> 02:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>landing and a story about him having</v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation with a carpenter under</v>

3028
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:01.870
<v Speaker 3>carpenter said that he didn't believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon landing.</v>

3029
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>them television fellers they can make</v>

3030
02:09:04.541 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 3>anything look real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

3031
02:09:06.761 --> 02:09:08.880
<v Speaker 3>this is a quote and bill clinton's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking book.</v>

3032
02:09:08.881 --> 02:09:10.750
<v Speaker 3>He saId,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then I thought that guy was a</v>

3033
02:09:10.751 --> 02:09:13.540
<v Speaker 3>quack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after our crank,</v>

3034
02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:16.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever crazy person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after eight years in the white</v>

3035
02:09:16.481 --> 02:09:18.250
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering if he wasn't ahead of</v>

3036
02:09:18.251 --> 02:09:19.600
<v Speaker 3>his time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

3037
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy that was the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the United States and he's</v>

3038
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.400
<v Speaker 3>talking specifically about an old carpet</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling them the moon landing was fake,</v>

3039
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:33.160
<v Speaker 3>and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wondered after eight years in the</v>

3040
02:09:33.161 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 3>white house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that guy wasn't ahead of his time.</v>

3041
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Causation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>

3042
02:09:38.831 --> 02:09:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3043
02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:40.510
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3044
02:09:40.511 --> 02:09:41.960
<v Speaker 3>could be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3045
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:43.690
<v Speaker 3>could be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

3046
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:46.570
<v Speaker 3>It could be just a good story and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's the thing about conspiracy</v>

3047
02:09:46.571 --> 02:09:49.900
<v Speaker 3>theories is like they lead you on all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dead end chases.</v>

3048
02:09:50.050 --> 02:09:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's weiRd is that trump's a</v>

3049
02:09:52.091 --> 02:09:55.520
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theorist is a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 3>adjectives.</v>

3050
02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:56.850
<v Speaker 3>You can add on to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3051
02:09:56.950 --> 02:10:01.530
<v Speaker 3>but the conspiracy theory aspect is</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting as far as I know.</v>

3052
02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 3>he's to want to know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have those.</v>

3053
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:04.600
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what the first shit he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

3054
02:10:04.601 --> 02:10:06.640
<v Speaker 3>He probably sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on with the aliens?</v>

3055
02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Where do we hAve an interest in it?</v>

3085
02:11:08.301 --> 02:11:08.960
<v Speaker 1>times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3086
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of times.</v>

3087
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>He's on a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>two was crazy.</v>

3088
02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm subscribed to you on youtube and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit keeps kicking me off and I don't</v>

3089
02:11:15.531 --> 02:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3090
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.421
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3091
02:11:17.421 --> 02:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>the government tries to control me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't handle the truth.</v>

3092
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit pissed me off.</v>

3093
02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:24.013
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3094
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just an algorithm issue</v>

3095
02:11:26.241 --> 02:11:28.370
<v Speaker 1>because we also have an issue with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We retweet.</v>

3096
02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an automatic tweet that youtube</v>

3097
02:11:31.941 --> 02:11:35.450
<v Speaker 1>does and it sends out that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>live that we're broadcasting live.</v>

3098
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Tweets it out to people or sends it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sends it in a fucking spanish.</v>

3099
02:11:40.210 --> 02:11:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Was it like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the dark today.</v>

3100
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Today it says I started a live stream on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

3101
02:11:45.451 --> 02:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>but the last was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3102
02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it was like dutch or swedish or a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weird languages that I didn't,</v>

3103
02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3104
02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 1>interesting man.</v>

3105
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

3106
02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.121
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>

3107
02:11:53.121 --> 02:11:53.810
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3108
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:56.990
<v Speaker 1>my google shows up in my inbox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my name,</v>

3109
02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.950
<v Speaker 1>like in german,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the inbox thing and says just in</v>

3110
02:12:00.951 --> 02:12:01.401
<v Speaker 1>german,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3111
02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea because you got hacked</v>
<v Speaker 1>some german,</v>

3112
02:12:03.501 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 1>godly man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3113
02:12:04.821 --> 02:12:07.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't got shit to hack though.</v>

3114
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3115
02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:13.400
<v Speaker 1>So the long answer of your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3116
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:15.830
<v Speaker 1>that's where I stood on this whole moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing thing.</v>

3117
02:12:15.831 --> 02:12:19.130
<v Speaker 1>That's why I came around to thinking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way that was way too</v>

3118
02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:19.964
<v Speaker 1>convinced that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3119
02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3120
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced I was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fucking real low levels of</v>

3121
02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:26.960
<v Speaker 1>understanding of any of the sciences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3122
02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the problem is as a</v>

3123
02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so scientifically illiterate,</v>

3124
02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

3125
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes so much room for speculation</v>

3126
02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.130
<v Speaker 1>and you're kind of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of prisoner of,</v>

3127
02:12:40.131 --> 02:12:40.964
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3128
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 1>of people who are masters of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>crafts,</v>

3129
02:12:44.150 --> 02:12:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of a prisoner to their quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote agenda.</v>

3130
02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad of a term on it,</v>

3131
02:12:49.271 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>but you're kind of prisoner of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have,</v>

3132
02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:51.853
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

3133
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:56.060
<v Speaker 1>any choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to take their word for war,</v>

3134
02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:58.040
<v Speaker 1>to pursue it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3135
02:12:58.041 --> 02:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>To learn about what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself,</v>

3136
02:12:59.610 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but if they're right or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3137
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3138
02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:05.120
<v Speaker 1>BecauSe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case in almost everything</v>

3139
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:07.070
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was always like a real problem</v>

3140
02:13:07.071 --> 02:13:11.000
<v Speaker 1>with martial arts was there was this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who had all the information and you</v>

3141
02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 1>didn't know and then you would listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them station and we're like,</v>

3142
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:14.520
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

3143
02:13:14.650 --> 02:13:17.000
<v Speaker 1>And you would think it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now like there's videos you can</v>

3144
02:13:17.001 --> 02:13:19.580
<v Speaker 1>watch on youtube of like some crazy kung</v>
<v Speaker 1>fu.</v>

3145
02:13:19.581 --> 02:13:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Dude that's just talking nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really know how to do</v>

3146
02:13:22.281 --> 02:13:24.110
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just got some crazy thing about</v>

3147
02:13:24.111 --> 02:13:27.800
<v Speaker 1>cheap power and if you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think this guy is real.</v>

3148
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:30.920
<v Speaker 1>But once you know you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you motherfucker.</v>

3149
02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>So like someone can pull</v>

3150
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.850
<v Speaker 3>the wool over your eyes about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just easily do it with any</v>

3151
02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:36.684
<v Speaker 3>kind of science</v>

3152
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:38.580
<v Speaker 2>rocket traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see that's what really got me</v>

3153
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>interested in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like you fall,</v>

3154
02:13:41.191 --> 02:13:42.740
<v Speaker 2>especially with this climate change</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3155
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:47.640
<v Speaker 2>So like you start reading the articles</v>
<v Speaker 2>people give you why it's not real and</v>

3156
02:13:47.641 --> 02:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>then you go and follow the source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where I really learned to</v>

3157
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>start filing the sources at all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>articles because it's those sources that</v>

3158
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you lead to the main source of where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information actually came from and it</v>

3159
02:13:57.391 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 2>usually leads to like a scientific paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>published in a journal and they're</v>

3160
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:07.131
<v Speaker 2>fairly easy to understand because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very with the math and the in the,</v>

3161
02:14:07.461 --> 02:14:09.540
<v Speaker 2>in the actual science is probably won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

3162
02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 2>but like you can get to the break down</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they got to that conclusions and</v>

3163
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:19.071
<v Speaker 2>that's what I can appreciate about is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gives you a uh,</v>

3164
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 2>an understanding.</v>

3165
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With citations shows you each what we,</v>

3166
02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:27.050
<v Speaker 3>each study was all about certain things</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

3167
02:14:27.051 --> 02:14:28.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's super important to be able to</v>

3168
02:14:28.311 --> 02:14:30.950
<v Speaker 3>look at that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously they've got a lot of math.</v>

3169
02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of times though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3170
02:14:32.111 --> 02:14:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was biology.</v>

3171
02:14:33.171 --> 02:14:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do it with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3172
02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:37.670
<v Speaker 3>different discoveries event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got obsessed with this chimpanzee that</v>

3173
02:14:37.671 --> 02:14:40.070
<v Speaker 3>they found the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the bondo ape.</v>

3174
02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:43.610
<v Speaker 3>And I start reading as much as I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>read about this chimpanzee is one</v>

3175
02:14:43.611 --> 02:14:47.210
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee in the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way bigger than other</v>

3176
02:14:47.211 --> 02:14:48.680
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's enormous.</v>

3177
02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like a six foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds.</v>

3178
02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Pansy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk upright.</v>

3179
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.520
<v Speaker 3>The huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous chimps.</v>

3180
02:14:55.521 --> 02:14:56.354
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3181
02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:59.290
<v Speaker 3>well they have two different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps to like the locals called him a</v>

3182
02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:02.000
<v Speaker 3>tree beaters and that they have another</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3183
02:15:02.001 --> 02:15:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I think they call them the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>dwellers and tree beaters.</v>

3184
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what they call them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

3185
02:15:06.411 --> 02:15:09.440
<v Speaker 3>these chimps are so big that they nest</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the ground,</v>

3186
02:15:09.441 --> 02:15:11.720
<v Speaker 3>like gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even bother climate trees</v>

3187
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:12.583
<v Speaker 3>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

3188
02:15:12.710 --> 02:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>they're limited to this one area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a crest on their forehead,</v>

3189
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.370
<v Speaker 3>like a gorilla where it's a high crest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the bone.</v>

3190
02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.750
<v Speaker 3>So they have these big massive plates of</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle that they bite down with.</v>

3191
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:26.120
<v Speaker 3>and then they have like this gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 3>crest.</v>

3192
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Regular chimps don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RIght?</v>

3193
02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:30.410
<v Speaker 3>So when they first found skulls from</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>

3194
02:15:30.411 --> 02:15:32.060
<v Speaker 3>they were confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to figure out was a</v>

3195
02:15:32.061 --> 02:15:35.180
<v Speaker 3>hybrid between a gorilla and a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

3196
02:15:35.181 --> 02:15:36.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3197
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:38.480
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where'd you get that?</v>

3198
02:15:39.610 --> 02:15:41.880
<v Speaker 3>That looks like that looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks weird.</v>

3199
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:43.370
<v Speaker 3>That looks fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see that one?</v>

3200
02:15:43.371 --> 02:15:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go up to go push your cursor above and</v>

3201
02:15:45.891 --> 02:15:47.030
<v Speaker 3>then go slightly to the right.</v>

3202
02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Go all the way to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

3203
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:50.290
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom level.</v>

3204
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Bottom level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3205
02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:52.171
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3206
02:15:52.171 --> 02:15:52.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3207
02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Were those those pictures right above?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go straight above.</v>

3208
02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:56.893
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to the right,</v>

3209
02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.610
<v Speaker 3>to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the right.</v>

3210
02:15:58.611 --> 02:15:59.570
<v Speaker 3>One more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next guy.</v>

3211
02:15:59.810 --> 02:16:01.160
<v Speaker 3>That picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

3212
02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just make it bigger.</v>

3213
02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>That was taken by a guy named carl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on.</v>

3214
02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:11.140
<v Speaker 3>He's a swiss wildlife photographer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became obsessed with these bondo apes</v>

3215
02:16:11.691 --> 02:16:14.240
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it was somewhere around 1996</v>

3216
02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:19.250
<v Speaker 3>and he moved to the Congo and he stayed</v>
<v Speaker 3>there for quite a while trying to take</v>

3217
02:16:19.251 --> 02:16:21.560
<v Speaker 3>photographs of these really elusive</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

3218
02:16:21.650 --> 02:16:26.650
<v Speaker 3>but they got that one on a camera trap</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fucking huge chimpanzee.</v>

3219
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 3>There's another line that is dead that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shot</v>

3220
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:32.590
<v Speaker 4>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these two guys hold it by the.</v>

3221
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:35.800
<v Speaker 4>That'S one for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a pretty bIg one,</v>

3222
02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:37.900
<v Speaker 4>but there's that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a way bigger one.</v>

3223
02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:42.640
<v Speaker 4>They shot that one at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is fucking huge and it was shot</v>

3224
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.010
<v Speaker 4>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some near some airstrip,</v>

3225
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:50.220
<v Speaker 4>so that's like one of the big pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence other than now they have bones</v>

3226
02:16:50.291 --> 02:16:55.291
<v Speaker 4>and they have a scat samples and tissue</v>
<v Speaker 4>samples so they know they exist but</v>

3227
02:16:55.631 --> 02:16:56.830
<v Speaker 4>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3228
02:16:56.831 --> 02:17:00.940
<v Speaker 4>really hard to get to because the Congo</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like almost as wide as the United</v>

3229
02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:04.780
<v Speaker 4>States and it's just filled with fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit that can kill you.</v>

3230
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Everything everywhere you'd go is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>monsters.</v>

3231
02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:10.830
<v Speaker 4>Just everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crocodiles.</v>

3232
02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:14.080
<v Speaker 4>Wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the people that are dangerous as</v>

3233
02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:14.940
<v Speaker 4>fuck too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:18.670
<v Speaker 4>But this area is particularly dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 4>where because it's so.</v>

3235
02:17:18.671 --> 02:17:19.790
<v Speaker 4>It's really difficult to get them.</v>

3236
02:17:19.810 --> 02:17:21.320
<v Speaker 4>But I got obsessed with this god damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

3237
02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:24.000
<v Speaker 4>so I was reading everything I could read</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

3238
02:17:24.001 --> 02:17:26.280
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have never been.</v>

3239
02:17:26.590 --> 02:17:27.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of it.</v>

3240
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Never fell in love with the apes like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that man.</v>

3241
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by apes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3242
02:17:32.710 --> 02:17:35.300
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we're so close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just,</v>

3243
02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.780
<v Speaker 4>we're just the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just took.</v>

3244
02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:40.750
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just,</v>

3245
02:17:40.751 --> 02:17:42.220
<v Speaker 4>when you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3246
02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.980
<v Speaker 4>I got super high once when I went to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>zoo and hung out,</v>

3247
02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 4>I was by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sat in front of a chimpanzee cage for</v>

3248
02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:52.320
<v Speaker 4>like a good solid hour man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington's champs.</v>

3249
02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I was on an edible.</v>

3250
02:17:56.890 --> 02:18:01.630
<v Speaker 4>They sent you back and I remember like</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching them interact with each other,</v>

3251
02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 4>thinking like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're like people but not.</v>

3252
02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:07.900
<v Speaker 4>They're like people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wAy more brutal.</v>

3253
02:18:07.901 --> 02:18:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Way more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly way less paths.</v>

3254
02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Airy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of airy.</v>

3255
02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Not too long ago I took my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love it go.</v>

3256
02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what kind of primate it</v>

3257
02:18:18.821 --> 02:18:19.361
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3258
02:18:19.361 --> 02:18:21.970
<v Speaker 4>but he was just hanging on the cage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we was walking by and he was just kinda</v>

3259
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.130
<v Speaker 4>like following us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3260
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:27.940
<v Speaker 4>I felt so weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was almost like he was like,</v>

3261
02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:29.680
<v Speaker 4>what's going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How y'all doing?</v>

3262
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Like he wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the weirdest shit.</v>

3263
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:34.420
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even on the edible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3264
02:18:34.421 --> 02:18:38.060
<v Speaker 4>it's weird when you see their nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out there like us.</v>

3265
02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 4>You ever seen one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one where a little kid was like</v>

3266
02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.150
<v Speaker 4>pounding our chest in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>window and patch</v>

3267
02:18:46.650 --> 02:18:48.880
<v Speaker 4>himself after he cracked it.</v>

3268
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:53.650
<v Speaker 4>I saw that was he cracked the glass man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y'all need to be in there,</v>

3269
02:18:53.651 --> 02:18:54.790
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3270
02:18:54.850 --> 02:18:56.530
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3271
02:18:56.531 --> 02:18:57.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only.</v>

3272
02:18:57.401 --> 02:19:01.930
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I could see that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would make sense why you want to keep</v>

3273
02:19:01.931 --> 02:19:04.510
<v Speaker 4>them there because if they're so</v>
<v Speaker 4>endangered that you need to keep them</v>

3274
02:19:04.511 --> 02:19:07.810
<v Speaker 4>alive in these contained environments</v>
<v Speaker 4>before they figured out a way to</v>

3275
02:19:07.811 --> 02:19:09.760
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce them back into the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3276
02:19:09.761 --> 02:19:12.130
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's thinking as part of the</v>

3277
02:19:12.131 --> 02:19:16.330
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like 99 percent of all species have</v>

3278
02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.620
<v Speaker 4>died off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3279
02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:18.700
<v Speaker 4>It's part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of.</v>

3280
02:19:18.730 --> 02:19:20.620
<v Speaker 4>So you think we should just let him die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let him die.</v>

3281
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's deep.</v>

3282
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:23.410
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that people want.</v>

3283
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:26.200
<v Speaker 4>People don't want to hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just showing me what everything</v>

3284
02:19:26.201 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 4>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's fucked up?</v>

3285
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 1>What if we're killing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we're letting these gorilla stay</v>

3286
02:19:30.801 --> 02:19:32.840
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really if we just let them die,</v>

3287
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:35.360
<v Speaker 1>they would evolve into something way</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler.</v>

3288
02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:36.620
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would have said,</v>

3289
02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the shit that I've been thinking</v>

3290
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:39.411
<v Speaker 1>about dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3291
02:19:39.411 --> 02:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the evolutionary tree of life,</v>

3292
02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:46.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have fucked it up.</v>

3293
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say fuck it up because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely a part of it,</v>

3294
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's like we're directly influencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I just wonder what,</v>

3295
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:58.070
<v Speaker 1>like where's it gonna go from here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

3296
02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:00.100
<v Speaker 1>All lifeforms do that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like,</v>

3297
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 1>like we've kind of escaped because</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural selection is all about survival</v>

3298
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:06.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that's basically it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just adapting to the environment to</v>

3300
02:20:08.931 --> 02:20:11.480
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's not about that anymore.</v>

3301
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:14.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't adapt to our environment to</v>

3302
02:20:14.001 --> 02:20:14.834
<v Speaker 1>survive anymore.</v>

3303
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:16.540
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we create our environment.</v>

3304
02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:18.650
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely different.</v>

3305
02:20:18.651 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's still adapting to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment because instead of using</v>

3306
02:20:21.801 --> 02:20:25.160
<v Speaker 1>like physical tools aNd attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out a way to do it mentally</v>

3307
02:20:25.161 --> 02:20:27.430
<v Speaker 1>where we create things that can alter</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

3308
02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like still what it signals is to me</v>

3309
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:36.070
<v Speaker 1>is a new form of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a physical structure like</v>

3310
02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:40.690
<v Speaker 1>structures and things that we're using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're um,</v>

3311
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:45.530
<v Speaker 1>household appliances or electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is evolving as well,</v>

3312
02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:46.480
<v Speaker 1>like it's all happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3313
02:20:46.481 --> 02:20:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the new ability to adapt.</v>

3314
02:20:49.821 --> 02:20:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all coming out of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of coming out of us.</v>

3315
02:20:52.281 --> 02:20:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We're putting our work into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

3316
02:20:54.241 --> 02:20:55.074
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3317
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've ever seen this part</v>

3318
02:20:59.091 --> 02:21:03.380
<v Speaker 1>of evolution a arise like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3319
02:21:03.381 --> 02:21:05.610
<v Speaker 1>we haven't not like this now.</v>

3320
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

3321
02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so like I love that live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that we do the information age and</v>

3322
02:21:10.911 --> 02:21:13.700
<v Speaker 1>all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I still want to be able to live</v>

3323
02:21:13.701 --> 02:21:15.890
<v Speaker 1>like 300 years from now to see where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at in society.</v>

3324
02:21:15.891 --> 02:21:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Would love to see it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm scared.</v>

3326
02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it happen though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this now I like this.</v>

3327
02:21:22.731 --> 02:21:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm fascinated to see what this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here.</v>

3328
02:21:26.390 --> 02:21:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I am too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

3329
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:30.140
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see ai and I want to see,</v>

3330
02:21:30.141 --> 02:21:32.540

<v Speaker 1>I want to see life on other planets.</v>

3331
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I think ai is going to turn out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>blade runner.</v>

3332
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:37.010

<v Speaker 1>about these artificial people that are</v>

3337
02:21:45.861 --> 02:21:48.830
<v Speaker 1>so difficult to tell that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know they're artificial.</v>

3338
02:21:48.831 --> 02:21:51.440
<v Speaker 1>People know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>now is harrison ford in it.</v>

3341
02:21:56.751 --> 02:21:58.550

<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to check him out.</v>

3364
02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:02.790
<v Speaker 1>happen and then they would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial people that you couldn't</v>

02:25:20.141 --> 02:25:22.660
<v Speaker 1>a babysitter right across the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my apartment complex.</v>

3421
02:25:22.661 --> 02:25:27.661
<v Speaker 1>I used to to africa to name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one day I come into the room and</v>

3422
02:25:28.891 --> 02:25:31.050
<v Speaker 1>there's paramedics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they were paramedics,</v>

3423
02:25:31.051 --> 02:25:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but there's paramedics and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting,</v>

3424
02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:36.790
<v Speaker 1>she's laying on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was pregnant all the time and I see</v>

3425
02:25:36.791 --> 02:25:38.620
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her belly split open.</v>

3426
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw csection at like three or four</v>

3427
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:43.900
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom does not believe me to this day.</v>

3428
02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.840
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you saw csection.</v>

3429
02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I notice like how,</v>

3430
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:48.510
<v Speaker 1>how do I.</v>

3431
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything at the time</v>

3432
02:25:49.991 --> 02:25:52.750
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I know that didn't happen in</v>

3433
02:25:52.751 --> 02:25:54.780
<v Speaker 1>every babysitter place run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3434
02:25:54.781 --> 02:25:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw it as a kid.</v>

3435
02:25:56.860 --> 02:25:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I was very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have.</v>

3436
02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure why they didn't take me out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the room.</v>

3437
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disturbing man.</v>

3438
02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.880
<v Speaker 1>But as a good fee to see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just information,</v>

3439
02:26:06.881 --> 02:26:08.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody got hurt.</v>

3440
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a crazy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's how life gets into the world.</v>

3441
02:26:11.621 --> 02:26:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was like cutting a belly open</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see a three year old,</v>

3442
02:26:15.101 --> 02:26:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably leave the room just</v>

3443
02:26:17.891 --> 02:26:19.990
<v Speaker 1>in case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doN't know what it did to me.</v>

3444
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3445
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't encourage a three year old to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it like that.</v>

3446
02:26:25.061 --> 02:26:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I know it'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3447
02:26:26.141 --> 02:26:27.100
<v Speaker 1>it's good for the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know.</v>

3448
02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He needs to leT them know what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>get injured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3535
02:30:38.031 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my dad actually had.</v>

3536
02:30:39.850 --> 02:30:43.140
<v Speaker 4>We not sure what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he kind of lost feeling in his arm.</v>

3537
02:30:43.141 --> 02:30:45.440
<v Speaker 4>He a pinched nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably what it was,</v>

3538
02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:47.810
<v Speaker 4>but like it's slowly creeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way too.</v>

3539
02:30:47.811 --> 02:30:49.610
<v Speaker 4>It was like two years ago and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly.</v>

3540
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:51.620
<v Speaker 4>He still struggles with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3541
02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:54.830
<v Speaker 4>he's slowly getting better slowly as</v>
<v Speaker 4>slow process though.</v>

3542
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Real slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super slow.</v>

3543
02:30:56.750 --> 02:31:01.080
<v Speaker 4>My friend boss route and the former ufc</v>
<v Speaker 4>champion had a neck surgery.</v>

3544
02:31:01.081 --> 02:31:05.780
<v Speaker 4>He had something fucked up in his neck</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his arm shrunk to the point where he</v>

3545
02:31:05.781 --> 02:31:09.230
<v Speaker 4>calls one arm is baby arm atrophy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's coming back now.</v>

3546
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But every time I see him like a year</v>

3547
02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:13.370
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a little bit better.</v>

3548
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's multi,</v>

3549
02:31:15.231 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>multi year process and this guy was ufc</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight champion and he was a bad</v>

3550
02:31:20.071 --> 02:31:23.340
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker has prime and it got him to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where it's.</v>

3551
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:26.340
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't even grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you telling me they just blast your</v>

3552
02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:29.280
<v Speaker 4>pussy with some radiation and those</v>
<v Speaker 4>nerves are going to go back.</v>

3553
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't they take that nerve pussy</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and put on boss rutan's arm?</v>

3554
02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:38.520

<v Speaker 4>but to get my arm back had to go to the</v>

3561
02:31:52.831 --> 02:31:56.760

<v Speaker 4>they would use it on a lot of things</v>

3562
02:31:56.761 --> 02:31:57.540
<v Speaker 4>that we could use.</v>

3697
02:37:44.541 --> 02:37:46.970
<v Speaker 4>time because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they basically weren't arresting people</v>

3698
02:37:46.971 --> 02:37:51.890
<v Speaker 4>for it for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had kind of said like a state or a</v>

3699
02:37:51.970 --> 02:37:55.640
<v Speaker 4>citywide thing that they weren't going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to arrest people when I first came</v>

<v Speaker 4>like I don't remember what year,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3703
02:38:02.211 --> 02:38:05.150
<v Speaker 4>we don't arrest people for weed and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to like,</v>

3704
02:38:05.151 --> 02:38:07.760
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they passed something in the city where</v>

3705
02:38:07.761 --> 02:38:09.410
<v Speaker 4>they don't arrest people for weed in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>city.</v>

3706
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:10.431
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

3707
02:38:10.431 --> 02:38:12.820
<v Speaker 4>But this is Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought of colorado's like</v>

3708
02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:14.100
<v Speaker 4>cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3709
02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:15.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you think of Wyoming,</v>

3710
02:38:15.741 --> 02:38:19.670
<v Speaker 4>the republicans and real strict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but denver was never like that.</v>

3711
02:38:19.671 --> 02:38:22.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird town man.</v>

3712
02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:23.233
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's.</v>

3713
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know a lot about dishes.</v>

3714
02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:29.980
<v Speaker 4>What started the movement in denver to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go towards progression and we.</v>

3715
02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Well I think the statewide movement of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado making marijuana legal and</v>

3716
02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:40.640
<v Speaker 4>being the first state along with seattle</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Washington state rather.</v>

3717
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.983
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3718
02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Colorado people don't like people</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling them what the fuck to do.</v>

3719
02:38:45.730 --> 02:38:47.030
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3720
02:38:47.031 --> 02:38:49.550
<v Speaker 4>they're rugged people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to realize if you can,</v>

3721
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:53.930
<v Speaker 4>if you're family made it to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the 18 hundreds of whatever,</v>

3722
02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:58.490
<v Speaker 4>you got some rugged jeans is that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

3723
02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:02.480
<v Speaker 4>those people move there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a core group of people that</v>

3724
02:39:02.481 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 4>settled in Colorado during the gold rush</v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest destiny man,</v>

3725
02:39:07.191 --> 02:39:08.700
<v Speaker 4>when people came over and it's crazy.</v>

3726
02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:12.830
<v Speaker 4>homestead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get blocks of land and stay on it for a</v>

3727
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:14.270
<v Speaker 4>few years and he can get to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3728
02:39:14.271 --> 02:39:15.770
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit all happened.</v>

3729
02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:18.320
<v Speaker 4>And those were the gold rush people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3730
02:39:18.370 --> 02:39:19.410
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3731
02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't that what Colorado was originally</v>

3732
02:39:21.021 --> 02:39:22.810
<v Speaker 4>settled?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't California was right?</v>

3733
02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:24.920
<v Speaker 4>California gold rush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why the fuck do people go to</v>

3734
02:39:24.921 --> 02:39:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I have no idea.</v>

3735
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:30.620
<v Speaker 4>We'll put google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When was denver established?</v>

3736
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:34.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to guess I'm going to take a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess.</v>

3737
02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:36.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it was like the 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>

3738
02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to go after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eighteen hundred 50 1800.</v>

3739
02:39:39.891 --> 02:39:41.630
<v Speaker 4>18 50 slash 50 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>58.</v>

3740
02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:42.980
<v Speaker 4>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

3741
02:39:42.981 --> 02:39:44.090
<v Speaker 4>That was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty good.</v>

3742
02:39:44.091 --> 02:39:45.200
<v Speaker 4>And I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good.</v>

3743
02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:49.640
<v Speaker 4>So think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of gangsters traveling across</v>

3744
02:39:49.641 --> 02:39:52.460
<v Speaker 4>the country?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3745
02:39:52.461 --> 02:39:57.461
<v Speaker 4>you had to be a bad motherfucker to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>across the country if you live here,</v>

3746
02:39:57.800 --> 02:39:58.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3747
02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:01.100
<v Speaker 4>In California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same thing holds true like the</v>

3748
02:40:01.101 --> 02:40:05.050
<v Speaker 4>people that first got here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the 17 and 18 hundreds,</v>

3749
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:07.040
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was and at first settled</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

3750
02:40:07.250 --> 02:40:10.270
<v Speaker 4>but then everybody comes in here and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actors and it's just the.</v>

3751
02:40:10.271 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Well gene pools water down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in denver that gene pools not</v>

3752
02:40:14.041 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 4>watered down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a bunch of people in still,</v>

3753
02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:21.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The original dna is of just gangsters</v>

3754
02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:25.200
<v Speaker 4>who came over here to try to make it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild west.</v>

3755
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:30.790
<v Speaker 4>So that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying the liberalism of the</v>

3756
02:40:31.051 --> 02:40:33.930
<v Speaker 4>move from east to west and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3757
02:40:34.890 --> 02:40:39.150
<v Speaker 4>the gene pool of not giving a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'S interesting.</v>

3758
02:40:39.450 --> 02:40:41.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be that there's definitely</v>

3759
02:40:41.551 --> 02:40:43.560
<v Speaker 4>something to it because if you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

3760
02:40:43.561 --> 02:40:46.770
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the really like there's a giant</v>

3761
02:40:46.771 --> 02:40:48.870
<v Speaker 4>group of immigrants in the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>

3762
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:52.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's also like a real hostility</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's almost like ancient on the east</v>

3763
02:40:52.471 --> 02:40:55.430
<v Speaker 4>coast of the country that's different</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the hostility on the west coast.</v>

3764
02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:59.370
<v Speaker 4>It was like an ancient sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty way people get along with each</v>

3765
02:40:59.371 --> 02:41:01.770
<v Speaker 4>other in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could attribute it to the call</v>

3766
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:04.230
<v Speaker 4>that you can attribute it to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>weather.</v>

3767
02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:05.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get attributed to about</v>

3768
02:41:05.781 --> 02:41:07.980
<v Speaker 4>overpopulation but on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3769
02:41:07.981 --> 02:41:09.390
<v Speaker 4>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could attribute it to that.</v>

3770
02:41:09.391 --> 02:41:11.580
<v Speaker 4>I think in both things could be possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

3771
02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:14.850
<v Speaker 4>But there's other spots like you go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada and the weather,</v>

3772
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:17.940
<v Speaker 4>the weather's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like toronto is crazy traffic and a lot</v>

3773
02:41:17.941 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 4>of people and they're nice as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard.</v>

3774
02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Canada once.</v>

3775
02:41:21.450 --> 02:41:22.740
<v Speaker 4>They're so nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so nice.</v>

3776
02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:25.800
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it has something to do with</v>

3777
02:41:25.801 --> 02:41:30.180
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the original people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>came there or these hard scrabble people</v>

3778
02:41:30.330 --> 02:41:33.630
<v Speaker 4>that we're trying to make it by getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a boat and traveling across the ocean</v>

3779
02:41:33.631 --> 02:41:36.050
<v Speaker 4>to a land that they really didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>much about me.</v>

3780
02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.790
<v Speaker 4>He might've known someone here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might've had an uncle or family</v>

3781
02:41:38.791 --> 02:41:41.100
<v Speaker 4>members and they were going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>settle.</v>

3782
02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:44.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean those are gangster people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be so and then the people</v>

3783
02:41:44.761 --> 02:41:46.800
<v Speaker 4>that were sick of those people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>

3784
02:41:46.801 --> 02:41:49.560
<v Speaker 4>we're going to keep going and kept going</v>
<v Speaker 4>west.</v>

3785
02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:51.450
<v Speaker 4>And then in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>58,</v>

3786
02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:55.310
<v Speaker 4>they settled in denver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean those were rugged people,</v>

3787
02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:58.560
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you see that city there and that</v>

3788
02:41:58.561 --> 02:42:02.640
<v Speaker 4>city is embraced by the rocky mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have this constant natural beauty</v>

3789
02:42:02.641 --> 02:42:04.360
<v Speaker 4>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a little bowl to it.</v>

3790
02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:07.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a bowl and you look out your</v>
<v Speaker 4>window.</v>

3791
02:42:07.591 --> 02:42:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Like if you stay in a hotel in denver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look out the window,</v>

3792
02:42:09.691 --> 02:42:10.524
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3793
02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:12.240
<v Speaker 4>you see the rocky mountain and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3794

<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real clean city to like a super guy was</v>

3795
02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:18.990
<v Speaker 4>while I was walking downtown and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they keep it up here.</v>

3796
02:42:19.050 --> 02:42:20.250
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3797
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:23.910
<v Speaker 4>It's also like you have to be a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of person to be able to survive</v>

3798
02:42:23.911 --> 02:42:25.280
<v Speaker 4>that winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3799
02:42:25.430 --> 02:42:29.580

<v Speaker 4>can just fucking tolerate shit and still</v>

<v Speaker 4>show up at work and get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be a baby out here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You could be a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you can be like,</v>

3802
02:42:34.951 --> 02:42:37.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to go out when it rains</v>
<v Speaker 4>because all the oil on the road,</v>

3803
02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:39.810
<v Speaker 4>it's like people don't know how to drive</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>

3804
02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:43.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call in and I'm going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>like usually like sometimes you had to</v>

3874
02:45:32.771 --> 02:45:36.310
<v Speaker 1>kick him and run and kick them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and they limp,</v>

3875
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3876
02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to maneuver sometimes.</v>

3877
02:45:39.101 --> 02:45:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to outrun them.</v>

3878
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It's tough but it's like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm new to the whole dog thing so</v>

3879
02:45:45.011 --> 02:45:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I got a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a husky was,</v>

3880
02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I used to be fearful of dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not fearful in a sense.</v>

3881
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I was scared it was gonna kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just didn't want to have to fight</v>

3882
02:45:53.351 --> 02:45:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

3883
02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:55.691
<v Speaker 1>it's not in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3884
02:45:55.691 --> 02:45:57.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's a crazy thing to have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3885
02:45:57.570 --> 02:46:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Like it was every bit that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got bitten in the face when I was</v>

3886
02:46:00.341 --> 02:46:01.570
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3887
02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:04.270
<v Speaker 1>So like my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was staying with us at the time and</v>

3888
02:46:04.271 --> 02:46:07.090
<v Speaker 1>he had dogs and for like two weeks I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never had a problem before.</v>

3889
02:46:07.091 --> 02:46:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never a problem before,</v>

3890
02:46:08.771 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 1>so I was back from school</v>

3891
02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and a sudden like I woke up just happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hear her and I was like,</v>

3892
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:18.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was me,</v>

3893
02:46:18.450 --> 02:46:19.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk to dogs.</v>

3894
02:46:19.740 --> 02:46:23.020
<v Speaker 2>So I was scared as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I woke up and he just asked</v>

3895
02:46:23.021 --> 02:46:24.920
<v Speaker 2>me saying ever since then kind of dog.</v>

3896
02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3897
02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:29.260
<v Speaker 1>German shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite kids,</v>

3898
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:31.290
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dogs bite kids.</v>

3899
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:34.260
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my aunt got bit by a german shepherd.</v>

3900
02:46:34.261 --> 02:46:36.180
<v Speaker 1>She got a face fucked up by a german</v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd.</v>

3901
02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know two or three other kids that have</v>

3902
02:46:39.421 --> 02:46:41.020
<v Speaker 1>been bitten by german shepherds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3903
02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:42.143
<v Speaker 2>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3904
02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.990
<v Speaker 2>And so ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck I don't,</v>

3905
02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fuck with dogs at all.</v>

3906
02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I hated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we had this one pit that I got</v>

3907
02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>swept the like dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked by your fence every day,</v>

3908
02:46:51.901 --> 02:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>like get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it together,</v>

3909
02:46:53.461 --> 02:46:55.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But lIke I used to run from him rum from</v>

3910
02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:57.300
<v Speaker 2>so many different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

3911
02:46:57.301 --> 02:46:59.110
<v Speaker 2>it probably became a game for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>privately</v>

3912
02:46:59.250 --> 02:47:01.620
<v Speaker 1>many different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk by and still couldn't get you</v>

3913
02:47:01.621 --> 02:47:04.100
<v Speaker 1>on one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers gonna come by and I'm</v>

3914
02:47:04.101 --> 02:47:07.510
<v Speaker 1>going to kinda figure my way through</v>
<v Speaker 1>this so I'm going to get them.</v>

3915
02:47:07.690 --> 02:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing else to do.</v>

3916
02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:10.660
<v Speaker 2>This one I found out about dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I finally was like,</v>

3917
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I was 29 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3918
02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I got to get over this fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I gotta get up gotta,</v>

3919
02:47:14.011 --> 02:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>get a dog and see what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got a husky cutest little thing</v>

3920
02:47:17.941 --> 02:47:21.990
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after awhile I started understanding</v>

3921
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>the dogs more and you understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really only pieces of shit if</v>

3922
02:47:26.401 --> 02:47:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the owners are pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like the dog directly reflects</v>

3923
02:47:30.181 --> 02:47:33.900
<v Speaker 2>its owner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now I understand like growing up</v>

3924
02:47:33.901 --> 02:47:36.480
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhoods I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody has time or money to care for the</v>

3925
02:47:36.481 --> 02:47:37.500
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they should.</v>

3926
02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:39.880
<v Speaker 2>So they're henri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3927
02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:41.400
<v Speaker 2>just like the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3928
02:47:41.410 --> 02:47:46.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as president,</v>

3929
02:47:46.350 --> 02:47:49.390

<v Speaker 1>hooker,</v>

3939
02:48:12.350 --> 02:48:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do do it though.</v>

3940
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll let the people know when I'm lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wear a fake mustache.</v>

3941
02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:19.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give the same press conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll have a fake mustache.</v>

3942
02:48:19.850 --> 02:48:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Good evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

3943
02:48:21.261 --> 02:48:26.090
<v Speaker 1>But sentence the president is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alerting me of this important news.</v>

3944
02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I probably do,</v>

3945
02:48:28.281 --> 02:48:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I probably pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in jail for weed.</v>

3946
02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with me being here and</v>

3947
02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat.</v>

3948
02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:35.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a problem.</v>

3949
02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.880
<v Speaker 1>It's such a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3950
02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:39.800
<v Speaker 1>The president pardoned chelsea manning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3951
02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Didn't obama pardoned chelsea manning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pardoned him,</v>

3952
02:48:42.231 --> 02:48:44.890

<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

3953
02:48:44.930 --> 02:48:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pardon means you're exonerated of any</v>

3954

<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

3989
02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then</v>

3990
02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:19.220
<v Speaker 4>little member when obama was running for</v>
<v Speaker 4>president and they found out he was</v>

3991
02:50:19.511 --> 02:50:23.870
<v Speaker 4>friends with a professor in chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the weatherman.</v>

3992
02:50:25.220 --> 02:50:28.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the weatherman was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary that I watched duncan trust.</v>

3993
02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:30.460
<v Speaker 4>My friend called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

3994
02:50:30.461 --> 02:50:32.170
<v Speaker 4>you got to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

3995
02:50:32.410 --> 02:50:35.860
<v Speaker 4>They were taking acid and robbing banks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and having orgies together.</v>

3996
02:50:36.210 --> 02:50:37.150
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3997
02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Obama was known as the weatherman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was this group,</v>

3998
02:50:40.301 --> 02:50:45.070
<v Speaker 4>this radical group in the 19 seventies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was trying to overthrow the</v>

3999
02:50:45.071 --> 02:50:48.400
<v Speaker 4>government and they were just a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy people and they were doing acid</v>

4000
02:50:48.401 --> 02:50:51.760
<v Speaker 4>and one of them wound up being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>professor one day.</v>

4001
02:50:52.210 --> 02:50:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Here it is bill ayers and the ninth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 2008 presidential election</v>

4002
02:50:56.831 --> 02:50:59.770
<v Speaker 4>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy was one of the members of</v>

4003
02:50:59.771 --> 02:51:04.771
<v Speaker 4>the weathermen and he went from being</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially an antigovernment terrorist</v>

4004
02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:11.230
<v Speaker 4>to me to be in a college professor.</v>

4005
02:51:12.130 --> 02:51:14.410
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a college professor,</v>

4006
02:51:14.411 --> 02:51:15.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say here?</v>

4007
02:51:16.390 --> 02:51:17.770
<v Speaker 4>My eyes were way too shitty to read</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

4008
02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Trying to read what it says</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

4009
02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Confirms or denies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a big deal.</v>

4010
02:51:23.591 --> 02:51:24.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says here,</v>

4011
02:51:24.221 --> 02:51:28.150
<v Speaker 4>the weathermen right there is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>committee heading the weathermen</v>

4012
02:51:28.151 --> 02:51:31.150
<v Speaker 4>starting at its creation the summer of</v>
<v Speaker 4>1969.</v>

4013
02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:34.090
<v Speaker 4>The hippie movement has sort of a hippie</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement,</v>

4014
02:51:34.091 --> 02:51:37.450
<v Speaker 4>but another one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot like a lot of those hippie</v>

4015
02:51:37.451 --> 02:51:39.340
<v Speaker 4>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second to claim that those</v>

4016
02:51:39.341 --> 02:51:42.370
<v Speaker 4>three members of the weatherman who had</v>
<v Speaker 4>died during the accident of explosion</v>

4017
02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:44.230
<v Speaker 4>all assembling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4018
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:46.150
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to blow shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4019
02:51:47.230 --> 02:51:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>project mayhem thing and a fight club.</v>

4020
02:51:50.711 --> 02:51:51.880
<v Speaker 4>That kind of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4021
02:51:51.881 --> 02:51:53.710
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to blow buildings up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>

4022
02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:55.293
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4023
02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:58.930
<v Speaker 4>he apparently knew obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he was just like this real super</v>

4024
02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:02.170
<v Speaker 4>radical lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably did some time.</v>

4025
02:52:02.290 --> 02:52:04.810
<v Speaker 4>got out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>became a college professor.</v>

4026
02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:05.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did he go,</v>

4027
02:52:05.801 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 4>did</v>

4028
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.240
<v Speaker 1>he do time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4029
02:52:08.241 --> 02:52:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out to thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>how obama was connected to them.</v>

4030
02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I think obama just knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4031
02:52:15.581 --> 02:52:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of those thinGs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4032
02:52:18.430 --> 02:52:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Mama contacts with ehrs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>password bIking in the same neighborhood</v>

4033
02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:23.800
<v Speaker 1>or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4034
02:52:23.801 --> 02:52:25.570
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal about that?</v>

4035
02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they had some sort of a,</v>

4036
02:52:29.470 --> 02:52:34.470
<v Speaker 1>a cordial friendship and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concern that he was connected to a guy</v>

4037
02:52:35.571 --> 02:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>that used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BuT the guy was free now.</v>

4038
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what kind of mistakes of people</v>

4039
02:52:39.941 --> 02:52:43.470
<v Speaker 1>made when they're 18 that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>exonerate them from when they're 50,</v>

4040
02:52:43.710 --> 02:52:45.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there like a certain limit to the</v>

4041
02:52:45.611 --> 02:52:48.350
<v Speaker 1>amount of time that you have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4042
02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

4043
02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:53.650
<v Speaker 1>can you be held responsible for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that you did when you were 18?</v>

4044
02:52:53.650 --> 02:52:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the tough about the murder thing.</v>

4045
02:52:56.760 --> 02:52:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Like weather underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they call themselves.</v>

4046
02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:00.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not the weatherman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather underground.</v>

4047
02:53:00.661 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 1>If you kill somebody at 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years old,</v>

4048
02:53:03.041 --> 02:53:06.120
<v Speaker 1>like life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not.</v>

4049
02:53:06.330 --> 02:53:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just a tough subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was,</v>

4050
02:53:09.210 --> 02:53:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I had this argument the other day like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how subjective morality is and it's kind</v>

4051
02:53:13.881 --> 02:53:18.881
<v Speaker 1>of all just based on super subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>life experiences and opinions will have</v>

4052
02:53:19.301 --> 02:53:22.990
<v Speaker 1>a war subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowing people to go over and do</v>

4053
02:53:22.991 --> 02:53:24.190
<v Speaker 1>it and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4054
02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you slip them and say thank you for</v>

4055
02:53:26.081 --> 02:53:30.700
<v Speaker 1>killing those people that have always</v>
<v Speaker 1>been super affect cognitive dissonance</v>

4056
02:53:30.701 --> 02:53:32.110
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke it's,</v>

4057
02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:34.470
<v Speaker 1>it's because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

4058
02:53:34.471 --> 02:53:36.250
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've normalized it to the point where</v>

4059
02:53:36.251 --> 02:53:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you see where you hear casualty of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

4060
02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:41.560
<v Speaker 1>it is a normal term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4061
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:44.830
<v Speaker 1>but those are like innocent civilians</v>
<v Speaker 1>being murdered sometimes,</v>

4062
02:53:45.370 --> 02:53:47.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the attitude that they</v>

4063
02:53:47.891 --> 02:53:50.320
<v Speaker 1>have to die in order to serve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater good.</v>

4064
02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Some casual observers have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally be killed and some</v>

4065
02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:56.150
<v Speaker 1>collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4066
02:53:56.230 --> 02:53:59.010
<v Speaker 1>that makes terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

4067
02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4068
02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that if we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will lose whatever headstart on</v>

4069
02:54:07.031 --> 02:54:08.650
<v Speaker 1>civilization we have over the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

4070
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:11.780
<v Speaker 1>just start all over how we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

4071
02:54:11.900 --> 02:54:14.110
<v Speaker 1>It sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like some people say after</v>

4072
02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:19.140
<v Speaker 1>they smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we should be able to write,</v>

4073
02:54:20.891 --> 02:54:22.780
<v Speaker 1>but how would we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would we do?</v>

4074
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we got enough technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough smart people to just sit around</v>

4075
02:54:27.161 --> 02:54:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man,</v>

4076
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:31.090
<v Speaker 1>this ain't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree,</v>

4077
02:54:31.690 --> 02:54:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely have enough resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feed everybody.</v>

4078
02:54:35.470 --> 02:54:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we certainly are close.</v>

4079
02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I think we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4080
02:54:38.231 --> 02:54:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a matter of figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to put it in whether or not we</v>

4081
02:54:41.861 --> 02:54:45.960
<v Speaker 1>should be eating the same shit we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>already eating because you know,</v>

4082
02:54:47.170 --> 02:54:51.130
<v Speaker 1>if you look at all the different people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are living in this country eating</v>

4083
02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:53.440
<v Speaker 1>corn products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that alone,</v>

4084
02:54:53.441 --> 02:54:54.340
<v Speaker 1>like why is that the case?</v>

4085
02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Like why is corn and so many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

4086
02:54:56.410 --> 02:54:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not because it's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because we're doing the best</v>

4087
02:54:58.781 --> 02:55:00.160
<v Speaker 1>job arose in abundance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4088
02:55:00.530 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 1>well you can grow massive amounts of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these fields and the government</v>

4089
02:55:04.041 --> 02:55:07.510
<v Speaker 1>subsidizes it and then it becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole entangled sort of a system where</v>

4090
02:55:07.511 --> 02:55:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the farmers are growing it and If they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a subsidy from the</v>

4091
02:55:10.701 --> 02:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be profitable.</v>

4092
02:55:12.141 --> 02:55:14.060
<v Speaker 1>But it is profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the government,</v>

4093
02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:14.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4094
02:55:14.811 --> 02:55:17.240
<v Speaker 1>they know that those places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got to count on those folks when it</v>

4095
02:55:17.241 --> 02:55:19.340
<v Speaker 1>comes to like elections and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

4096
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And I started going to mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets entangled I guess.</v>

4097
02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Messy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4098
02:55:23.831 --> 02:55:27.170
<v Speaker 1>So do we have enough to feed each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way we're eating now?</v>

4099
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

4100
02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:30.020
<v Speaker 1>But we shouldn't eat and the way we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating now,</v>

4101
02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:31.670
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4102
02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:35.450
<v Speaker 1>for sure we have enough food to feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>people the way we eat now,</v>

4103
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but we should be eating like at whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>

4104
02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you go to whole foods is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4105
02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be registered shop here.</v>

4106
02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's food.</v>

4107
02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking real food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Organic shit always.</v>

4108
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand that whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing either.</v>

4109
02:55:51.230 --> 02:55:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just means they don't have</v>

4110
02:55:53.390 --> 02:55:54.650
<v Speaker 1>pesticides on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4111
02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Everything is organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phyllis,</v>

4112
02:55:57.470 --> 02:55:59.980
<v Speaker 1>philosophically you can make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make that argument every short</v>

4113
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:01.610
<v Speaker 1>organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if we tamper with it,</v>

4114
02:56:01.611 --> 02:56:03.200
<v Speaker 1>we're organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're from the earth.</v>

4115
02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Poisons natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4116
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything that you make is made</v>

4117
02:56:07.701 --> 02:56:10.040
<v Speaker 1>out of something on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that's artificial or</v>

4118
02:56:10.041 --> 02:56:14.300
<v Speaker 1>chemical or whatever the fuck it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still made out of raw materials that are</v>

4119
02:56:14.301 --> 02:56:16.940
<v Speaker 1>found here on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4120
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some organic food is better for</v>

4121
02:56:20.361 --> 02:56:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you probably because it doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals on it.</v>

4122
02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And with the idea of gmo is where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets real weird because almost</v>

4123
02:56:26.961 --> 02:56:28.520
<v Speaker 1>everything is genetically modified.</v>

4124
02:56:28.930 --> 02:56:29.763
<v Speaker 1>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

4125
02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:32.840
<v Speaker 1>my stepdad's when they hit me today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a geneticist.</v>

4126
02:56:33.050 --> 02:56:33.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4127
02:56:33.591 --> 02:56:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually developed one of the firSt</v>

4128
02:56:36.470 --> 02:56:40.680
<v Speaker 1>strands for the tyson chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like a bad ass to this</v>

4129
02:56:40.750 --> 02:56:42.230
<v Speaker 1>making franken chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4130
02:56:42.231 --> 02:56:44.570
<v Speaker 1>So what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do?</v>

4131
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you how many chicken the</v>

4132
02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he tells us stories</v>

4133
02:56:51.591 --> 02:56:54.860
<v Speaker 1>about how he like genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can genetically modified chickens</v>

4134
02:56:54.861 --> 02:56:57.290
<v Speaker 1>without feathers and all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>

4135
02:56:57.291 --> 02:56:58.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

4136
02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:01.160
<v Speaker 1>That gene spLicing shit is amazing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

4137
02:57:01.250 --> 02:57:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of crispr?</v>

4138
02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:08.270
<v Speaker 1>That shit is so you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you open that pandora's box of once</v>

4139
02:57:08.271 --> 02:57:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you genetically modify human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go backwards because they've</v>

4140
02:57:11.691 --> 02:57:13.670
<v Speaker 1>already started to do with embryos in</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

4141
02:57:13.950 --> 02:57:14.721
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4142
02:57:14.721 --> 02:57:17.060
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to do with non-viable</v>
<v Speaker 1>human embryos.</v>

4143
02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So they're taking non-viable human</v>
<v Speaker 1>embryos and they're doing all these</v>

4144
02:57:21.171 --> 02:57:23.780
<v Speaker 1>genetic experiments on them and altering</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genes.</v>

4145
02:57:23.781 --> 02:57:28.781
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is now is it's like the baby</v>

4146
02:57:28.821 --> 02:57:32.870
<v Speaker 1>steps towards something that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be just,</v>

4147
02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:36.440
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be standard maybe 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now or whether that's the</v>

4148
02:57:36.441 --> 02:57:38.990
<v Speaker 1>next step in our evolutionary history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

4149
02:57:38.991 --> 02:57:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Jamie python breeder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genetically bred a python to have an</v>

4150
02:57:43.401 --> 02:57:46.820
<v Speaker 1>emoji on it home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

4151
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

4152
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:53.390
<v Speaker 1>It's got smiley faces all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking insane.</v>

4153
02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:55.150
<v Speaker 1>How did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just breed.</v>

4154
02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you said it took like eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations of breeding and can I can</v>

4155
02:57:58.281 --> 02:58:01.930
<v Speaker 1>sell this worth 4,500 bucks and 40 it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might.</v>

4156
02:58:01.931 --> 02:58:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Might've been wearing initially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

4157
02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:06.990
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so cool.</v>

4158
02:58:06.991 --> 02:58:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Looking emoji pythons as crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's crazy because that's just</v>

4159
02:58:11.701 --> 02:58:12.630
<v Speaker 1>done through breeding.</v>

4160
02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Like like how to make a husky out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf and that's done through breeding.</v>

4161
02:58:16.690 --> 02:58:19.200
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're talking about</v>

4162
02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:23.160
<v Speaker 1>chickens that don't have any feathers</v>
<v Speaker 1>like serious science.</v>

4163
02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So it goes deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to the point of like how far do you</v>

4164
02:58:26.971 --> 02:58:29.730
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far the restraints of our,</v>

4165
02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:34.820
<v Speaker 1>of our humanity and humanity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you genetically modify humans to</v>

4166
02:58:35.251 --> 02:58:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4167
02:58:37.170 --> 02:58:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you take out the genes that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer gene and you take out the jeans</v>

4168
02:58:41.341 --> 02:58:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and this and that and have that and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of we're living our health</v>

4169
02:58:44.701 --> 02:58:47.160
<v Speaker 1>expectancy or the life expectancy goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>up exponentially.</v>

4170
02:58:47.430 --> 02:58:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

4171
02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:52.860
<v Speaker 1>would it be moral to not take those</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes out of your kids?</v>

4172
02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:54.433
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4173
02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah,</v>

4174
02:58:59.131 --> 02:59:00.360
<v Speaker 1>the people that would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4175
02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I know my kid's gonna have a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what god intended.</v>

4176
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

4177
02:59:04.210 --> 02:59:05.460
<v Speaker 1>For ns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

4178
02:59:05.461 --> 02:59:08.430
<v Speaker 1>that shit is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

4179
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's also debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4180
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4181
02:59:11.580 --> 02:59:14.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why they have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion in the first place is because</v>

4182
02:59:14.581 --> 02:59:17.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could argue it even if I</v>

4183
02:59:17.071 --> 02:59:18.900
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could argue that opinion.</v>

4184
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the weirdest things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people.</v>

4185
02:59:21.571 --> 02:59:25.260
<v Speaker 1>There's just so much messiness to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to something like that,</v>

4186
02:59:25.261 --> 02:59:29.460
<v Speaker 1>like some new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy technology.</v>

4187
02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You can make a super kid like you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make your kids seven feet tall,</v>

4188
02:59:33.001 --> 02:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>400 pounds solid muscle runs through</v>
<v Speaker 1>walls or make them a little pussy when</v>

4189
02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

4190
02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:41.640
<v Speaker 1>They only have two models.</v>

4191
02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:45.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a prius or a mustang.</v>

4192
02:59:45.360 --> 02:59:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Shelby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4193
02:59:47.700 --> 02:59:48.750
<v Speaker 1>One of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do?</v>

4194
02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just take the prius.</v>

4195
02:59:49.931 --> 02:59:51.420
<v Speaker 1>My kids just going to read a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

4196
02:59:51.450 --> 02:59:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids run through buildings now,</v>

4197
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:56.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the prius,</v>

4198
02:59:56.191 --> 02:59:57.024
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you?</v>

4199
02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already ran through building.</v>

4200
03:00:00.050 --> 03:00:01.470
<v Speaker 1>My opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skewed.</v>

4201
03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should probably write a book on how</v>

4202
03:00:03.931 --> 03:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>not to play football and be a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be a bad book coming from a</v>

4203
03:00:08.731 --> 03:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>guy like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would.</v>

4204
03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>People would definitely read it</v>
<v Speaker 1>official.</v>

4205
03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>If maybe if I had to do again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never played football.</v>

4206
03:00:14.760 --> 03:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would be your book.</v>

4207
03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>see you started when you were seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4208
03:00:19.381 --> 03:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4209
03:00:20.850 --> 03:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had no,</v>

4210
03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>whose idea was it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was ours,</v>

4211
03:00:24.691 --> 03:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>so me and my brother was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

4212
03:00:26.881 --> 03:00:27.714
<v Speaker 1>let's play football.</v>

4213
03:00:28.710 --> 03:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

4214
03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>You're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fat of it as a kid.</v>

4215
03:00:31.500 --> 03:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And so to me it's fun playing sports is</v>
