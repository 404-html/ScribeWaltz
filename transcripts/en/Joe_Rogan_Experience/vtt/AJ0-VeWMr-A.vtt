<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>getting late.</v>

<v Speaker 1>one with live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To change subjects had abandoned all</v>

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely good talk.</v>

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all is good to see you.</v>

8
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Great having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do too.</v>

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it since king queens </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent a long time and um,</v>

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I found out about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the whole scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were into it back then,</v>

12
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but it was one of those things where I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about it and then I met you.</v>

13
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intel wants to.</v>

15
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And I send the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty normal.</v>

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Preston is pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was normal,</v>

17
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

18
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess you get deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know them really well and it </v>

19
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.221
<v Speaker 1>might get a little weird because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is scientologist are good people.</v>

20
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really as I did,</v>

21
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>believed that we were doing amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things for the world.</v>

22
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>So they go into it thinking I'm helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm helping others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but then as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

25
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>as you get more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and by the way you don't really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to something intelligent when </v>

27
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you're assigned to help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're,</v>

28
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>when you're not in scientology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

29
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.651
<v Speaker 1>Like everything that I did and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is for the purpose of setting a good </v>

30
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good person,</v>

31
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>being a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>so to get you in because Dr does a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose and that like I would never tell</v>

33
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>when I was in a non scientologists my </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problems.</v>

34
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:45.291
<v Speaker 1>It would be kind of a bad for the church</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ever appear human to a non </v>

35
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>scientologists it'd be setting a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

36
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it would actually be considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a transgression if I told you joe,</v>

37
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

38
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting with my mother and fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my husband or I would never tell </v>

39
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you those types of things because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be bad pr for the church.</v>

40
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that you're taught.</v>

41
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

42
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you kinda grew up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

43
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>

44
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:16.521
<v Speaker 1>I think when my mother married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember precise intelligence a little </v>

45
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>bit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I remember precise Intelligi was,</v>

46
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a very Catholic Sicilian father </v>

47
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>who believed in punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed in not toe.</v>

48
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Did I talk to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're talking to me </v>

49
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Like my dad says that the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and then we don't talk back at all</v>

51
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.671
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is kind of what I knew and then </v>

52
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>we were baptized as Catholics because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother wasn't really religious.</v>

53
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>My mother is Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

54
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she,</v>

55
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't have any kind of religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

56
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>My father of course was Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got baptized as Catholics and the </v>

57
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>only time we really went to churches </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our grandma,</v>

58
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.250
<v Speaker 1>we went to visit her in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>in the city and my dad on holidays.</v>

60
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 2>that's really kind of all I remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>precise ontology and my mother meeting,</v>

62
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.381
<v Speaker 2>my Stepdad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in scientology and he got her in </v>

63
00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:13.381
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US,</v>

64
00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 2>like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

65
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the deal,</v>

66
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

68
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 2>like we went from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk until you're spoken to,</v>

69
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>to hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see you as spiritual beings.</v>

70
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.541
<v Speaker 2>We want you to talk to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want you to communicate like you're </v>

71
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

72
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

73
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirits in a little body.</v>

74
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 2>And so immediately that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>indoctrination begins that you're not a </v>

75
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

76
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as children,</v>

77
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 2>they always want to be grown up so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really starts to work.</v>

79
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>This kind of idea that you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elitist,</v>

80
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:54.721
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ego becomes kind of stroked as a </v>

81
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:54.721
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

82
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Like you're very powerful and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>returned and you came back and you found</v>

83
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.581
<v Speaker 2>yourself back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You picked your mother because you knew </v>

84
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>she'd get into scientology and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very strongly and you're very strong.</v>

85
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my sister,</v>

86
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>you picked your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've picked your mother for this </v>

87
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find your way back to scientology.</v>

88
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Now as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember you,</v>

89
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you want to be more important than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

90
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Kids are always trying to exercise their</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

91
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:21.271
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that speaks to something inside of </v>

92
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:21.271
<v Speaker 2>you that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

93
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm bigger than a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more than a kid.</v>

94
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a spiritual being in a little body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it sets up that kind of </v>

95
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>indoctrination very early on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like it because it made you,</v>

96
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 2>when you were young that made you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

97
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I can express myself better.</v>

98
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel suppressed.</v>

99
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

100
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going from a dad who's tells me to </v>

101
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>shut the F up and walk when I talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you sit in that chair and you </v>

102
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>don't have any thoughts worth listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

103
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very much a,</v>

104
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>an important being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a big being.</v>

105
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a word that's used a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those words,</v>

106
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 2>big beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your big being.</v>

107
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so yes,</v>

108
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you start to feel very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start to feel,</v>

109
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're powerful.</v>

110
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>These are not bad things to make kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>

111
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>but this is the way colts work and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't realize that Joe,</v>

112
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 2>until you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize any of this was really</v>

113
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:17.851
<v Speaker 2>going on because I've heard people call </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a cold throughout my 30 plus years </v>

114
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 2>and I was offended by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was deeply offended by it and I </v>

115
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even allow myself to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was in a cult.</v>

116
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>And so all these epiphany's are only </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening after the fact while I was </v>

117
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.361
<v Speaker 2>watching the scholarly documentary once </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Christianity and they were referring </v>

118
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 2>to it as the cult of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

119
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.130
<v Speaker 2>it's the word is the correct word and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to just look at it in terms of </v>

120
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>the actual literal definition of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's automatically got this negative</v>

121
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>connotation to the word called brainwash</v>
<v Speaker 2>or lost.</v>

122
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

123
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a inclination that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be tribal.</v>

124
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a natural inclination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have to be on a team.</v>

125
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And we like it when we're all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're a scientologist,</v>

126
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm a scientologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're together in this thing.</v>

127
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else doesn't get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

128
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a good feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

129
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.890
<v Speaker 2>And you're taught that you are taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are the elite of the world by </v>

130
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>the way you're going in every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

131
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going Easter and I'm going </v>

132
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

133
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 2>it's an every dayness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did you do every day?</v>

134
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Like when you say you went into real </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

135
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 2>do king of Queens and then after </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehearsal I'd have to drive to Hollywood</v>

136
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>and put in my two and a half hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

137
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Two and a half hours every day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

138
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.840
<v Speaker 2>every minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minimum.</v>

139
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

140
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 2>So then if I couldn't like let's say on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a tape day,</v>

141
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 2>it was there from nine in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>until 10 at night.</v>

143
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Asian know I'd have to make up the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the weekends or I'd have to make up </v>

144
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>time on my hiatus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be there all day and night.</v>

145
00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.300
<v Speaker 2>If you went to Hawaii on vacation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something very rare that scientologist </v>

146
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>we're going to vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to make up the time.</v>

147
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to make up the time when I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

148
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to put in on weekends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say if my schedule was,</v>

149
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 to 2:30</v>

150
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 2>to go in and I'd have to go in one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>six or one to 10 or nine to 10.</v>

151
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's an everydayness of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>indoctrination.</v>

152
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not only that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

153
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're studying the policies all day and</v>

154
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 2>all night you're looking up words you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

155
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 2>You're being tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like after you read an l,</v>

156
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>

157
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're tested,</v>

158
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 2>you go into another room and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the definition of this?</v>

159
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.350
<v Speaker 2>What is the definition of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

160
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 2>it's almost worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

161
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 2>we had a cult expert on and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse.</v>

162
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:44.081
<v Speaker 2>I entered the doors because you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>brainwash yourself because you have to </v>

163
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:47.891
<v Speaker 2>study the policies of the church and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get tested on it and you have </v>

164
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 2>to look up words you don't understand.</v>

165
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>You have to put them in sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to write essays,</v>

166
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:55.961
<v Speaker 2>you have to do clay demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're really brainwashing yourself </v>

167
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and you're speaking all the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

168
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you're all working towards one goal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is very intoxicated like it is to </v>

169
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>feel like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be tribal,</v>

170
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:12.161
<v Speaker 2>to be part of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being something part of </v>

171
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:15.071
<v Speaker 2>something that you think and and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>told and are reading every day is the </v>

172
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 2>most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna.</v>

173
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Save mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are doing the work that no other </v>

174
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>group is doing and so you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start.</v>

175
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 2>You want to believe that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe I'm more than just an actress.</v>

176
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm more than just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saving the planet.</v>

177
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>And now all this stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

178
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 2>you're going in for two and a half hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

179
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Are you trying to move your way up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranking system?</v>

180
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a chart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

181
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's a well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a.</v>

182
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 2>The indoc like the little courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called self improvement courses </v>

183
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 2>and these are the things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like me would say,</v>

184
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 2>like when people would ask me about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

185
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

186
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's courses for $35,</v>

187
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>$65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

188
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it's all it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very affordable like these,</v>

189
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>these are the lines that were taught to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it's not an outright lie,</v>

190
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's omitting a lot of data,</v>

191
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because really the next,</v>

192
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>the followup to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're really a scientology,</v>

193
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost you half a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy or whatever it's going to be,</v>

194
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:24.021
<v Speaker 2>but it's preset prices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you start on these self improvement </v>

195
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>courses and then you get onto this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual chart called the bridge.</v>

196
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.940
<v Speaker 2>And the bridge is very precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's doing different things.</v>

197
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 2>We're all working at the bottom all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way up to the top,</v>

198
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 2>which was ot eight.</v>

199
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>That's like the most enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how many people were Ota?</v>

200
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot anymore because the people who</v>

201
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>were in scientology and the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

202
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.610
<v Speaker 2>and seventies who got to Ota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is some bullshit.</v>

204
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't what I thought it was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

205
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:58.161
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of them left at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure scientology was big because it </v>

206
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>was almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost spoke to the time that it was,</v>

207
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people wanted free thinking,</v>

208
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but also wanted to be morally on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right path,</v>

209
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on drugs,</v>

210
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 2>like they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe not part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

212
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.420
<v Speaker 2>they kind of didn't want to be held by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

213
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain,</v>

214
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 2>a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did still wants virtuality and </v>

215
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 2>their life and I think it spoke to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of the time.</v>

216
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think you're,</v>

217
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find new scientologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

218
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 2>The Internet took a big chunk out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

219
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the information.</v>

220
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Information was very hard to get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

221
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

222
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say you are scientologists and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I just didn't see you.</v>

223
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

224
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 2>what happened to Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's Joe?</v>

225
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Why is he not in scientology anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

226
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:53.121
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell me whatever they want to tell </v>

227
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 2>me about you to discredit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an enemy to the church and here are</v>

228
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they could say anything.</v>

229
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And they do say anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately makes me not want to talk to</v>

230
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The common enemy,</v>

231
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 2>an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you're an enemy,</v>

232
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't actually talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't actually talk to you.</v>

233
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:12.471
<v Speaker 2>The policy says that once you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared labeled a suppressive person,</v>

234
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.470
<v Speaker 2>my association with you would then make </v>
<v Speaker 2>me a suppressive person and then me and </v>

235
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.271
<v Speaker 2>enemy so I can't actually talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can tell me whatever they want </v>

236
00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>to tell me about you.</v>

237
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I couldn't actually find out are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things true about joe?</v>

238
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 2>But now with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with social media,</v>

239
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>it's harder and harder to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell people whatever you want to tell</v>

240
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 2>them about the person because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information is there.</v>

241
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 2>You have to want to seek it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't seek it out.</v>

242
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to seek it out.</v>

243
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And when I did seek it out and I'd go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church,</v>

244
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 2>they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lie.</v>

245
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the real data.</v>

246
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And they have actual doctored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

247
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

248
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>it actually doctor things that make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>

249
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

250
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to go and take it to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyst,</v>

251
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to take it to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

252
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.520
<v Speaker 2>is this a real document?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

253
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend to believe the church you're in</v>

254
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 2>and raised in most of your life now.</v>

255
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.640
<v Speaker 2>It had to have been positive in some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

256
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave you some confidence.</v>

257
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It gave you a true belief in yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are on the right path.</v>

258
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Because I had seen some interviews with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you where you were talking about it when</v>

259
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you were in it and you genuinely seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that it was very beneficial to,</v>

260
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.280
<v Speaker 2>of course there's basic morals and basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools to help you in your life.</v>

261
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>But remember it wasn't educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most scientologists are not educated.</v>

262
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And so as far as a college education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any education?</v>

263
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left school in the eighth grade.</v>

264
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology does not value a traditional</v>

265
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:52.531
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They value your education in high </v>

266
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:52.531
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

267
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old were you?</v>

268
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old you and Heisler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the eighth graders.</v>

269
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Like 13 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

270
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.660
<v Speaker 2>So when you were 13 you just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to school,</v>

271
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.720
<v Speaker 2>stopped going to school and I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology and I was working like </v>

272
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.330
<v Speaker 2>literally working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling car insurance and you were </v>

273
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>working at 13 or scientology companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so was my sister.</v>

274
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

276
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 2>and people ask like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

277
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.500
<v Speaker 2>how come the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

278
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>nobody did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come child protective services,</v>

279
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>who's calling them who saying and not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mention where are then aligning.</v>

280
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Our parents are lying saying they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a private education,</v>

281
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:32.191
<v Speaker 2>they're getting tutored at home or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to a scientology school,</v>

282
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:35.940
<v Speaker 2>which is partially true or I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

283
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I got my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did things like that to,</v>

284
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

285
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.640
<v Speaker 2>the original question was what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was about me learning what it</v>

286
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 2>was about late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your original question?</v>

287
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:53.701
<v Speaker 2>Because I was answering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had to be of some benefit to you </v>

288
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>because it gave me confidence because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I was getting,</v>

289
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at these big words.</v>

290
00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm using a dictionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

291
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 2>you're doing more school than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could've ever imagined.</v>

292
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Even as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

293
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I started to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

295
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really accomplishing something.</v>

296
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

297
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:15.280
<v Speaker 2>there are benefits to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't realize because I was a kid</v>

298
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 2>that the things you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were beneficial in the real world,</v>

299
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were invented by Elbert Hubbard as </v>

300
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.871
<v Speaker 2>most people do believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying where these things are </v>

301
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:31.551
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have learned these things as </v>

302
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:34.041
<v Speaker 2>Sunday school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have learned these things about </v>

303
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:34.041
<v Speaker 2>being a good human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being around other people,</v>

304
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.330
<v Speaker 2>but regardless if I was brainwashed into</v>
<v Speaker 2>believing that I was doing great things </v>

305
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>and learning great things and that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

306
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

307
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>it does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say,</v>

308
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do these steps,</v>

309
00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 2>these take these steps and you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believe in me,</v>

310
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you can then attributed to Leah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say Lhi as an amazing life </v>

311
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.931
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She told me to do these things and </v>

312
00:14:58.931 --> 00:14:58.931
<v Speaker 2>without her I can't.</v>

313
00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not knowing that it was available to</v>

314
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.880
<v Speaker 2>me in the real world because I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'll.</v>

315
00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard had come up with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

316
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did it start to unravel for you?</v>

317
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

318
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just one thing.</v>

319
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I think people always think what was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

320
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just one thing was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was six years of me basically.</v>

321
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like begging them for these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be true that I was hearing about </v>

322
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.680
<v Speaker 2>like what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

323
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:35.681
<v Speaker 2>when I went to Tom Cruise's wedding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the leader's wife wasn't there and</v>

324
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:36.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 2>David Miscavige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the head of the Church of </v>

326
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

327
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>his wife wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I asked the question and I </v>

328
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is shelly?</v>

329
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Why is his assistant here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scattered people to scattered.</v>

330
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And then I was told I didn't have the F </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rank to be asking about a human </v>

331
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.750
<v Speaker 2>about the leader's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that she was just an average </v>

332
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.630
<v Speaker 2>person that I didn't have the rank to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask about the rank,</v>

333
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.470
<v Speaker 2>the rank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

334
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be okay.</v>

335
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:10.481
<v Speaker 2>That was the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I went to my friends now </v>

336
00:16:10.481 --> 00:16:10.481
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

337

<v Speaker 2>when you're my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider you family.</v>

338
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take my friends very seriously.</v>

339
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends have 35 years.</v>

340
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at my sex meet nails </v>

<v Speaker 1>you said Nice.</v>

343
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm different than other people when it </v>

344
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>comes to nails apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now when you say real,</v>

345
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:35.080

<v Speaker 1>Glued on?</v>

346
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to know that I'm </v>

347
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>appreciating the more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

348
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>We're finding out a lot about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do a whole couple of hours </v>

349
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 1>with you talking about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to hold onto cans and you don't</v>

350
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:54.581
<v Speaker 1>have to hold on cans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do have to wear Cologne because </v>

351
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Cologne wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You're too cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

353
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>So let me get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was I saying?</v>

355
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the right to question.</v>

356
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then seeing my friends' reaction to </v>

357
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to get involved in this,</v>

358
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something really off </v>
<v Speaker 1>with David Ms Dot.</v>

359
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what was going on.</v>

360
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw Tom have an executive role in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>

361
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>which had a problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember,</v>

362
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned very early on what l Ron </v>

363
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard says is the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

364
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

365
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not up for interpretation.</v>

366
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 2>There's no assimilation of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just what it says.</v>

367
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not what Joe thinks over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard said what Leah things.</v>

368
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 2>It's what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very strict.</v>

369
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does ela reach say?</v>

370
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Read it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

371
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's very tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was very by</v>

372
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>the book person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a by the book person.</v>

373
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have a recipe,</v>

374
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:59.361
<v Speaker 1>I followed exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do pinches and I'm doing that </v>

375
00:17:59.361 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do exactly how it says in the recipe.</v>

376
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I see how it goes into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientology is about word for word.</v>

377
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.150
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My understanding and the policy is there</v>

378
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:16.341
<v Speaker 1>is no celebrity that should be treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>any differently than any parishioner,</v>

379
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.130
<v Speaker 1>and I was seeing behavior and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing things that wouldn't be okay,</v>

380
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 1>that are not okay for the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>parishioner,</v>

381
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but we're being made to be okay for Tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't matter to me that he was </v>

382
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>taught to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him as a team member in the Church</v>

383
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 1>of Scientology and we were working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

384
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually thought I was a better </v>

385
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:42.370
<v Speaker 1>example of scientology than he was and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote reports on him,</v>

386
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.941
<v Speaker 1>like internal reports on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't realize we're kind of </v>

387
00:18:46.941 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 1>getting me a to be a target for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church,</v>

388
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't realize his position in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

389
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You wrote internal reports?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

390
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 1>We're all required to write reports on </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

391
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:01.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a policy about writing reports.</v>

393
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.250
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you and I are scientologist.</v>

394
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I go out one night,</v>

395
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.390

<v Speaker 1>So don't get it.</v>

396
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.370
<v Speaker 1>You seem uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

397
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

398
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You did it because he said Nice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to that you said Nice,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're nice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're beautiful.</v>

403
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.500

<v Speaker 1>If you wore Cologne,</v>

404
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you'd have better </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives.</v>

405
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.951
<v Speaker 1>depending on who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what person they come from and how the </v>

<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

419
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the internal reports on</v>
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.680
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you go,</v>

421
00:20:05.681 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you and I went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just went out one night.</v>

422
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:12.531
<v Speaker 1>We were going out for dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of us and something and I saw </v>

423
00:20:12.531 --> 00:20:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you doing something that's not for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

424
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I have to write a report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read aloud to drink.</v>

425
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

426
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I got lit up?</v>

427
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably write a report and say,</v>

428
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.560
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

429
00:20:24.561 --> 00:20:25.810
<v Speaker 1>LRH would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

430
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said yes.</v>

431
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So then I write a report on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said Joe was acting inappropriate.</v>

432
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:37.461
<v Speaker 1>He was making fun of l Ron Hubbard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not allowed to joke and </v>

433
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:40.401
<v Speaker 1>degrade Ron Hubbard as a policy called </v>
<v Speaker 1>joker's integrators and integrators.</v>

434
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I would be very much I've been,</v>

435
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.770
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been in trouble for that many </v>

436
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.770
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

437
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would have to write a report.</v>

438
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:55.531
<v Speaker 1>It's go writing you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to write you up because let's </v>

439
00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 1>say you went into like the next day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a session and you said,</v>

440
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they do the check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a check on you every day.</v>

442
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have an upset?</v>

443
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a present time problem or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you withholding anything?</v>

444
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a real swing intelligence,</v>

445
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:14.701
<v Speaker 1>you would know that you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be drinking and carrying on </v>

446
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:18.060
<v Speaker 1>because of a 24 hour rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't drink 24 hours before you're </v>

447
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 1>going to be doing a service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

448
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you're required to go in every day so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you never can drink.</v>

449
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do,</v>

450
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you consider it a transgression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's on your mind that you're </v>

451
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.200
<v Speaker 1>withholding this information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

452
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 1>if you went on a vacation and you knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were going to make it up when </v>

453
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you got back?</v>

454
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay because you're not going in </v>

455
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:40.440
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

456
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

457
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're just not getting a service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's if you're not going to </v>

458
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go in and you'd say,</v>

459
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went out last night,</v>

460
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:55.351
<v Speaker 1>I ordered a bunch of shots and I made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment about to l Ron Hubbard or </v>

461
00:21:55.351 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

462
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

463
00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 1>When was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would you do it with?</v>

464
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Who was there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write down all the names.</v>

465
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's also being recorded and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing everything down.</v>

466
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Who knew about it will be the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

467
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Who knew about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>

468
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah was there.</v>

469
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:09.520
<v Speaker 1>They go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leo was there.</v>

470
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

471
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Then that is going to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah knew about it and didn't do </v>

472
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd get pulled in.</v>

473
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you write a report on Joe?</v>

474
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Because Joe just admitted that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking and carrying on and you didn't </v>

475
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.040
<v Speaker 1>write him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>

476
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 1>So it creates that kind of environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a rat environment.</v>

477
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was.</v>

478
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I was writing up Tom and I was writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up David,</v>

479
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you write up,</v>

480
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:36.121
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for jumping on couches and being </v>

481
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was being inappropriate.</v>

482
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Jumping on couches for when he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah.</v>

483
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:44.191
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a bad example that also</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote up John for for the battlefield </v>

484
00:22:44.191 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was for the movie itself.</v>

485
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie was awesome.</v>

486
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen battlefield earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my favorite.</v>

487
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Unintentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would joke.</v>

488
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible.</v>

489
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but awesome.</v>

490
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Because it's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

491
00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Terrible becomes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It crosses over that.</v>

492
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After a while.</v>

493
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

494
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

495
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.560
<v Speaker 1>What's that movie with the dancing one </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Elizabeth Berkley showgirls,</v>

496
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.560
<v Speaker 1>showgirls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showgirls.</v>

497
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best one.</v>

498
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:14.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the terrible movie </v>

499
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:14.641
<v Speaker 1>becomes awesome because it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

500
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck were they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fantastic.</v>

501
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

502
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I can feel the earth is right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

503
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So I did things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that.</v>

504
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I was a great example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor am I a great example,</v>

505
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.100
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote a whole thing about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping up on Oprah's couch,</v>

506
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>but I also listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave myself up.</v>

507
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I know I was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing myself up.</v>

508
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:36.451
<v Speaker 1>I was reading my mother up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing my husband and he jumped </v>

509
00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:36.451
<v Speaker 1>up on Oprah's couch because he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

510
00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly,</v>

511
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he jumped up,</v>

512
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 1>they told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled me in and they said,</v>

513
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could it be that you're just not as high</v>

514
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>on the scale like in life,</v>

515
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they were saying like,</v>

516
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:53.111
<v Speaker 2>you're a bitch so you can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can understand that kind of love </v>

517
00:23:53.111 --> 00:23:57.190
<v Speaker 2>because I was like all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess because I've been married 20 </v>

518
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.190
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand jumping on account,</v>

519
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.500
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a good example because because</v>

520
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:08.801
<v Speaker 2>I cared so much about my church and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work that we were doing and I didn't </v>

521
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:12.521
<v Speaker 2>want the church to be seen as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's or one of its senior members,</v>

522
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:17.861
<v Speaker 2>which he's considered a senior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientologist thought it was </v>

523
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was out of line.</v>

524
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

525
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

526
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

527
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>of course there's many things that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be considered a bad example in my every </v>

528
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a great example.</v>

529
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the time I thought I was pretty </v>

530
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.490
<v Speaker 2>pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But looking at it now,</v>

531
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you feel like it's totally innocuous.</v>

532
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 2>He's just on a couch jumping around </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a good time.</v>

533
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you knew how serious scientology </v>

534
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>was about clearing the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did not go with our intentions and </v>

535
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>our goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

536
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.290
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was writing him up and I was writing </v>

537
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.061
<v Speaker 2>everybody up and I was writing everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at the wedding because I thought our </v>

538
00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 2>senior executives were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

539
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 2>wiring them back from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my hotel room,</v>

540
00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling one of my closest friends who </v>

541
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.120
<v Speaker 2>was a scientologist and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I need you to write this.</v>

542
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.151
<v Speaker 2>I need you to write this verbatim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to write this verbatim and I </v>

543
00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:04.151
<v Speaker 2>need you to get this to the watchdog </v>
<v Speaker 2>committee.</v>

544
00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:08.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think I took frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was frantic and I was heartbroken </v>

545
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
<v Speaker 2>because it's like seeing if you believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sea organization and the people</v>

546
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 2>at the higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.240
<v Speaker 2>that our senior executive Strada of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>church are living a pristine and perfect</v>

548
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:30.641
<v Speaker 2>life that you're trying to aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're spending your day and night </v>

549
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 2>and money and time like you.</v>

550
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:38.650
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm seeing not great examples of </v>

551
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 2>what this is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it seemed behind the curtain.</v>

552
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see this.</v>

553
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And I really thought I was going to save</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church.</v>

554
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:48.911
<v Speaker 2>I thought my writing reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm going to take over the </v>

555
00:25:48.911 --> 00:25:48.911
<v Speaker 2>church and I'm going to get it right by </v>
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>

556
00:25:48.911 --> 00:25:53.651
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really still believe in the policies </v>

557
00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:57.250
<v Speaker 2>of l Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just believe they were bending the </v>

558
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.321
<v Speaker 2>rules for celebrity and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a celebrity who gives a shit what </v>

559
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:03.611
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a scientologist first and a </v>

560
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:04.610
<v Speaker 2>celebrity second to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why it's difficult.</v>

561
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk shit about another </v>
<v Speaker 2>actor because we've all met asshole </v>

562
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 2>actors and we're not really supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be talking about them.</v>

563
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

564
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear a lot of actors doing </v>

565
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that to other actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me it was just a scientologist.</v>

566
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 2>So you take out these reports on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write these reports.</v>

567
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm sent to Florida immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Mecca,</v>

568
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>the hub of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right for interrogations.</v>

569
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean like interrogation to fly out</v>

570
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fly out there.</v>

571
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a room,</v>

572
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cameras,</v>

573
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 2>with my person who is armed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

574
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.210
<v Speaker 2>unbeknownst to me have a stack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reports that were written on me by </v>

575
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody who worked for Tom a stack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

576
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.300
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you about your report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he decided that everyone who works </v>

577
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.560
<v Speaker 2>for him has to take out a report on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he knew,</v>

578
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 2>but that that is that the church is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much involved with his life.</v>

579
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 2>He's staffed by people who work for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>

580
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.730
<v Speaker 2>No non scientologists works for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was if you say something bad </v>

581
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:22.311
<v Speaker 2>about this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about God and you and I</v>

582
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 2>was asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have sexual intentions towards him.</v>

583
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 2>What are your evil intentions towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>him?</v>

584
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 2>What are your evil intentions towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>David Miscavige?</v>

585
00:27:29.371 --> 00:27:34.371
<v Speaker 2>What are your evil intention towards l </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Hubbard and it was three months of </v>

586
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was and I had to retract everything I</v>

587
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I made it all up.</v>

588
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any of it to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

589
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and so then when I came back to la they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said they want to see you again here in </v>

590
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.750
<v Speaker 2>celebrity center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to celebrity center and they </v>

591
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.750
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

592
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 2>everything that was done to you was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

593
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

594
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just want to let it go.</v>

595
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You need to let it go because if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you're not letting go means </v>

596
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that you're guilty of the crimes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

597
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that everything was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was done to you in Florida because </v>

598
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:09.480
<v Speaker 2>they wanted me to come back because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of like,</v>

599
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I came back from Florida is kind of</v>

600
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 2>not really a dedicated scientologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

601
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't doing anything to rock the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat with my family.</v>

602
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And how long were you in Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For?</v>

603
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three months of,</v>

604
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dealing with this every day for three</v>

605
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to write apology letters.</v>

606
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.570
<v Speaker 2>So you're there for 90 days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise during my hiatus and shit.</v>

607
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

608
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing most of the time.</v>

609
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have a family.</v>

610
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.970
<v Speaker 2>You're married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother was there,</v>

611
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.140
<v Speaker 2>my daughter was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my husband was there.</v>

612
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 2>And how much the other day are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending all day?</v>

613
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 2>All Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Day.</v>

614
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see defending your life?</v>

615
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

616
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

617
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a movie where Meryl Streep and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot the name anyway,</v>

618
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.840
<v Speaker 2>they die and they go into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 2>the holding cell like where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to decide their fate,</v>

620
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:08.570
<v Speaker 2>are they going back to Earth which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered hell or they going on to </v>

621
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.591
<v Speaker 2>heaven and Meryl Streep lived a pristine</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and they review your life,</v>

622
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have judges and everything,</v>

623
00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:21.081
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they review good moments and bad </v>

624
00:29:21.081 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>moments of your life and they decide are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you going to go on,</v>

625
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 2>are you going to go back to hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Meryl Streep was of course pristine,</v>

626
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.390
<v Speaker 2>but then the guy that I keep forgetting </v>
<v Speaker 2>just run and saying,</v>

627
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:29.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

628
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:34.581
<v Speaker 2>they were looking at times where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't stick up for himself or where he </v>

629
00:29:34.581 --> 00:29:34.581
<v Speaker 2>pussied out of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

630
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 2>And so they were judging him pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>harshly,</v>

631
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Speaker 2>right where they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to come back in the morning.</v>

632
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like an old day.</v>

633
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Like we're reviewing</v>

634
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.090
<v Speaker 1>a 120 days of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

635
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked at like five days and </v>

636
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:49.440
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

637
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:49.440
<v Speaker 1>just come back when you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

638
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.850
<v Speaker 1>that was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my mother was there to do some </v>

639
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:53.850
<v Speaker 1>fluff thing and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

640
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.650
<v Speaker 1>come have lunch with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my person was like,</v>

641
00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.660
<v Speaker 1>be back in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go get a sandwich and eat in the </v>

642
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:00.660
<v Speaker 1>elevator and you need to be back here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>

643
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

644
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it was like defending your life because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother was just like,</v>

645
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 1>she had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

646
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 1>she didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't.</v>

647
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't usually tell your family what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

648
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't tell my husband what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to me because I didn't want to</v>

649
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:15.620
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine this idea?</v>

650
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Meet your husband in scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

651
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>my husband was out.</v>

652
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.680
<v Speaker 1>He was never in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying him a,</v>

653
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you made him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made him a scientologist.</v>

654
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:29.461
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good because he was still kind </v>

655
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:29.461
<v Speaker 1>of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

656
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:33.031
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was still kind of freaky a little </v>

657
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:33.031
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.740
<v Speaker 1>still believed in slapping and ass once </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a while.</v>

659
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So like I kinda got of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't slap,</v>

660
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>you're considered aberrated choking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

661
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

662
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 1>you would be considered like you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

663
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:52.080
<v Speaker 1>There's something really wrong with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

664
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

665
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so.</v>

666
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.230
<v Speaker 1>When you say things like Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

667
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

668
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're there for 90 days?</v>

669
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling my family when I'm going</v>

670
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not because I don't want to create a</v>

671
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:13.891
<v Speaker 1>bad situation with the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how crazy is that reviewing these </v>

672
00:31:13.891 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm admitting my crimes.</v>

673
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying maybe I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I do.</v>

674
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't see what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people that you're meeting with in</v>

675
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:28.381
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they assign you a person but you hadn't </v>

676
00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:31.891
<v Speaker 1>met them previously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just some person with paperwork and </v>

677
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:32.590
<v Speaker 1>they're going over your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they have you on the meter.</v>

678
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:37.591
<v Speaker 1>They have you on the lie detector test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean on the line with the cans that </v>

679
00:31:37.591 --> 00:31:37.591
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

680
00:31:37.591 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a room that's locked and </v>

681
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>nothing doesn't do anything right that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meter.</v>

682
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does something.</v>

683
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:47.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is an actual explanation </v>

684
00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:47.581
<v Speaker 1>for it in the real world.</v>

685
00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not smart enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retell it to you,</v>

686
00:31:49.661 --> 00:31:54.661
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was to have a meter here and you </v>

687
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:58.051
<v Speaker 1>had a thought I could show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does register that you thought </v>

688
00:31:58.051 --> 00:32:01.021
<v Speaker 1>something but you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate what those thoughts are </v>

689
00:32:01.021 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 1>not but as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as someone who trains in scientology</v>

690
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>all you're trained to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which what I was doing,</v>

691
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:10.561
<v Speaker 1>I was training to administer scientology</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people was learning to do that and I </v>

692
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 1>would learn to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

693
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.220
<v Speaker 1>what was that thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that thought?</v>

694
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just know that you had a thought </v>

695
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 1>and so I ask you a question and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the meter to see that it </v>

696
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 1>registered on the meter and regardless </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you want to talk about,</v>

697
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>we're only going to talk about what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see on the meter.</v>

698
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's open to suggestion,</v>

699
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

700
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 1>is this a moment where you had doubt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a moment where you were angry </v>

701
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 1>and then the person has to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

702
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.780
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

703
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And they start convincing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

704
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is they.</v>

705
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>You need some of your discussing coconut</v>
<v Speaker 1>water or no,</v>

706
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you liked that said are atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You loved it.</v>

707
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also didn't love your coffee drink,</v>

708
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure their sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved everything you had joe,</v>

709
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.350
<v Speaker 1>that this natural stuff you didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

710
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything needs a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sugar.</v>

711
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pure taste.</v>

712
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 1>The bean you like pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure.</v>

713
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.160
<v Speaker 1>So after this 90 days of being there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 days of being stuck in this,</v>

714
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must be like a management </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that I was really,</v>

715
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really messed up.</v>

716
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine too that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a pretty grand establishment </v>

717
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and clearwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

718
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's probably intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how a lot of cults and </v>

719
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 1>religions like to rocket it didn't go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a like a pretty big place.</v>

720
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're raised in it and you know </v>

721
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very familiar with it,</v>

722
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.991
<v Speaker 1>but it is when you realize your position</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the church takes a backseat to the </v>

723
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:54.161
<v Speaker 1>leader and Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realized that that was scary to me </v>

724
00:33:54.161 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 1>because it was against everything you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been taught.</v>

725
00:33:55.821 --> 00:34:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Everything I've been taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that had been taught is that </v>

726
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone is some sort of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and everyone's equal and then your</v>

727
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:07.511
<v Speaker 1>whole goal as scientologists act for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater good of mankind and sort of </v>

728
00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 1>bring as many people into this as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can because you're going to help them.</v>

729
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it wasn't ever going to get </v>

730
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:14.860
<v Speaker 1>somebody in because I want to screw with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lines up.</v>

731
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get this person in because I </v>

732
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.751
<v Speaker 1>want them to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to contribute to what we're </v>

733
00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:25.961
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is the thought process that Tom </v>

734
00:34:25.961 --> 00:34:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Cruise being this huge celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide figure that it's very </v>

735
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 1>important to keep him happy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

736
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:37.391
<v Speaker 1>The main goal of scientology is to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>tom what our ego boost that must be for </v>

737
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:38.050
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

738
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 1>will see a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is something that,</v>

739
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.370
<v Speaker 1>that people say all the time to me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that pot where men,</v>

740
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Speaker 1>that ashtray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

741
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Joe,</v>

742
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.730
<v Speaker 1>do you know that I've noticed smoked </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>

743
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh you should definitely try it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

744
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you should be.</v>

745
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

746
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause you to start freaking out thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all sorts of stuff.</v>

747
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just keep it dirty like that.</v>

748
00:35:00.771 --> 00:35:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The Ashtray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

749
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you make it nice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you presented in like,</v>

750
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my man cave.</v>

751
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Men will give a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

752
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually I shouldn't have been </v>

753
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.960
<v Speaker 1>surprised hearing what I heard before he</v>
<v Speaker 1>started for you don't try to talk over </v>

754
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.270
<v Speaker 1>each other because you know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say you've never had.</v>

755
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:26.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest like a little tiny </v>

756
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.631
<v Speaker 1>amount for you just because somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>said something about gummy bears to me </v>

757
00:35:28.631 --> 00:35:29.050
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

758
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with those gummy bears.</v>

759
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Like powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are horrendous.</v>

760
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>

761
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a journey</v>

762
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 3>on your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll give you extreme paranoia.</v>

763
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 3>You'll start finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's not,</v>

764
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 3>but when you come out of it it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial because you realize that it's</v>

765
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:51.051
<v Speaker 3>all bullshit and that you were nervous </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some things that it just </v>

766
00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>highlights your vulnerability that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes your blinders away.</v>

767
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't sound like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

768
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:59.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you wouldn't do it again or.</v>

769
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gummy gummy bears too.</v>

770
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I do them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You liked that feeling of being?</v>

771
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good for you.</v>

772
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good to be vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

773
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 3>It's good to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be vulnerable.</v>

774
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 3>You're really just this finite organism </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating through infinity,</v>

775
00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

776
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but I feel that way without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

777
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Well then you don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all for everybody.</v>

778
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of want to get to push it on me a </v>

779
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 3>little bit and you just gave up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it benefits a lot of people.</v>

780
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:30.891
<v Speaker 3>It makes you more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a better sense of </v>

781
00:36:30.891 --> 00:36:30.891
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you kinder.</v>

782
00:36:30.891 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I definitely that that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

783
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

784
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more.</v>

785
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

786
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 3>it makes you a more loving person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that.</v>

787
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

788
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Back to what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

789
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.080
<v Speaker 3>it makes sex feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes food taste better.</v>

790
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Marry to a Puerto Rican food that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a little shadow Puerto </v>

791
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Ricans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do not have sex.</v>

792
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:55.480
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them,</v>

793
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've only had sex with one of them.</v>

794
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm the celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

795
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.340
<v Speaker 2>we all know there's treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different treatment celebrities.</v>

796
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in scientology,</v>

797
00:37:10.001 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

798
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:16.070
<v Speaker 2>it's highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like nothing you could ever </v>

799
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.921
<v Speaker 2>imagine it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people say Tom doesn't leave </v>

800
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:20.920
<v Speaker 2>because they have information on him or </v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

801
00:37:20.921 --> 00:37:25.921
<v Speaker 2>that's not the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of power they receive from </v>

802
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:28.180
<v Speaker 2>this church is like nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

803
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It is like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no reason for them to leave </v>

804
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:33.640
<v Speaker 2>this environment.</v>

805
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's super beneficial for them to be </v>

806
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct it as employees,</v>

807
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:43.251
<v Speaker 3>they work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these people will take care of his </v>

808
00:37:43.251 --> 00:37:43.251
<v Speaker 3>every need.</v>

809
00:37:43.251 --> 00:37:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a policy on how to talk to </v>

810
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.430
<v Speaker 2>somebody like you wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

811
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:53.870
<v Speaker 2>if you said go get me a go get me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee and I wanted this temperature,</v>

812
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.820
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get it.</v>

813
00:37:55.821 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 2>We're five miles from any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

814
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.900
<v Speaker 2>we're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be none of that kind of talk.</v>

815
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Like not any policy about don't you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk back like ever.</v>

816
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't step out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't give an opinion,</v>

817
00:38:07.881 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't make a face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make a gesture,</v>

818
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:15.191
<v Speaker 2>you don't see if you step out of line in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way you are dealt with by the </v>

819
00:38:16.881 --> 00:38:21.881
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we spent essentially has servants </v>

820
00:38:21.881 --> 00:38:21.881
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>

821
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Lot,</v>

822
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

823
00:38:25.071 --> 00:38:30.071
<v Speaker 2>I don't begrudge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody would have staff like if you </v>

824
00:38:30.071 --> 00:38:30.071
<v Speaker 2>can have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go do it all day,</v>

825
00:38:30.071 --> 00:38:30.200
<v Speaker 2>all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it all day,</v>

826
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:34.190
<v Speaker 2>all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you believe as a scientologist,</v>

827
00:38:34.191 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you are working for somebody</v>

828
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:41.370
<v Speaker 1>who single handedly is saving the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you deserve that kind of punishment.</v>

829
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.930
<v Speaker 1>That's something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babe.</v>

830
00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Speaker 1>You understand what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that?</v>

831
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an abuse that is not justified,</v>

832
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.861
<v Speaker 1>but it is justified because you believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are single handedly saving the </v>

833
00:38:56.891 --> 00:39:00.300
<v Speaker 1>planet Capeesh Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

834
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

835
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

836
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 1>so he's the main figurehead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the main guy,</v>

837
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 1>like right up with ms dot savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

838
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And then John Travolta somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

839
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I think John was given what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a designation called Pecan where the </v>

840
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 1>con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not con,</v>

841
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Con k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h a k,</v>

842
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:28.040
<v Speaker 1>h a n Kokona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's given this designation of cocoon,</v>

843
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.410
<v Speaker 1>which there's a policy that basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>says you can kill another human being if</v>

844
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you were conned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look the other way.</v>

845
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And he was given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was given that by Eldorado Hubbard.</v>

846
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't we laugh because you don't make me</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

847
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Please don't make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't laugh.</v>

848
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you work on a car because </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

849
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.300
<v Speaker 1>not very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any takes?</v>

850
00:39:48.301 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I ruined because of Kevin Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't don't ruin this.</v>

851
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

852
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell him you're going to do with </v>

853
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would ruin a gel because he,</v>

854
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he would do some stupid shit with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands or something that he never </v>

855
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.220
<v Speaker 1>rehearsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would make me cry from laughter.</v>

856
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was really highly inappropriate </v>

857
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.160
<v Speaker 1>and moments that made me pee almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

858
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 1>He's allowed to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

859
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should look at the policy again.</v>

860
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to put.</v>

861
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.440
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to look the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if somebody said something wrong</v>

862
00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 1>to John Travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samurai sword and cut their head off,</v>

863
00:40:23.261 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you just got clean up the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got to clean up and because it's</v>

864
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:30.721
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called ethics protection and </v>

865
00:40:30.721 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 1>responsible for dealing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it.</v>

866
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Just leave the room and he would know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys would take care of it.</v>

867
00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Then there's also another policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

868
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I say these policies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't like when people say,</v>

869
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

870
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look it up.</v>

871
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look for yourself and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own decisions.</v>

872
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So I keep quoting these policies because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people to look it up so that they</v>

873
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Shit's true.</v>

874
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 1>She's not talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

875
00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another policy called ethics </v>

876
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.981
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another policy called the </v>

877
00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:02.200
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility of leaders,</v>

878
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.560
<v Speaker 1>which he actually says exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

879
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

880
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.590
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.930
<v Speaker 1>what you gotta do to protect a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do it.</v>

882
00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:15.931
<v Speaker 1>If you see a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you clean it up and the leader </v>

883
00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:18.151
<v Speaker 1>should never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read going clear by Lawrence Wright </v>

884
00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and I watched the HBO special on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

885
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stunning,</v>

886
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.210
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>

887
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:28.450
<v Speaker 1>crazy accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was blown away the book,</v>

888
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.770
<v Speaker 1>especially the book goes into great </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth about how bananas,</v>

889
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard</v>

890
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 3>was right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

891
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:41.350
<v Speaker 3>it's so odd to me that this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this information is out there.</v>

892
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Isn't out there though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

893
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 3>you're reading l Ron Hubbard words from </v>
<v Speaker 3>dianetics.</v>

894
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Write the book one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

895
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 3>the first book that we're all required </v>
<v Speaker 3>to read.</v>

896
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's required to read everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's written.</v>

897
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I wrote dynamics to have you sent to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

898
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ordered it.</v>

899
00:41:58.771 --> 00:42:01.700
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those late night </v>
<v Speaker 3>infomercial things when I first moved to</v>

900
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:05.000
<v Speaker 3>La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been into a self help,</v>

901
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.330
<v Speaker 3>self help selling Anthony Robbins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought all his tapes.</v>

902
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I used to listen to it on a Walkman back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the day and read his books and I,</v>

903
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

904
00:42:13.391 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 3>so I thought it was just more of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

905
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I got put on a list and I got sent </v>
<v Speaker 3>invitations out for years,</v>

906
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 3>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you,</v>

907
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I swear I'm actually willing to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them money.</v>

908
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Bet that you get mail after we talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm,</v>

909

<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

910
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Well I went to one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit down and you get an eater and </v>

911
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.210
<v Speaker 3>you hold the thing and the guy asks you </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

912
00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Diego.</v>

913
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:36.580
<v Speaker 3>And I was filming some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

914
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 3>so you saw the say they did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstration.</v>

915
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Did you see it read on the meter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the pinch test?</v>

916
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

917
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember a pinch test,</v>

918
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:51.311
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember holding onto these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and he would ask me some </v>

919
00:42:51.311 --> 00:42:53.741
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guy was very uninterested or </v>

920
00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:57.070
<v Speaker 3>disinterested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just seemed like he was kind of like </v>

921
00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.561
<v Speaker 3>being forced to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's was just going through the </v>

922
00:42:59.561 --> 00:42:59.561
<v Speaker 3>motions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seemed super bored.</v>

923
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

924
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 3>had he not been super bored?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you be full on right now?</v>

925
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

926
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

927
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I was doing it as a goof.</v>

928
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 3>It was only like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was ridiculous.</v>

929
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I was in San Diego filming something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this setup out there outside.</v>

930
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

931
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:19.331
<v Speaker 3>let me go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was just hoping I could weasel in </v>

932
00:43:19.331 --> 00:43:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and have a seat and nobody would know </v>
<v Speaker 3>who I am.</v>

933
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 3>I put on the cans and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

934
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

935
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I didn't give a fuck.</v>

936
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 3>He seen very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

937
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 3>a welcoming and loving because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember they do believe in what they're</v>

938
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

939
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying to you is the dynamics</v>

940
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:38.440
<v Speaker 3>and dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

941
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Elbert Hubbard is writing that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist,</v>

942
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 3>he's a decorated war hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

943
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.700
<v Speaker 3>that he was a college educated and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

944
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you're saying the information is out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

945
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.800
<v Speaker 3>What information other than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading is out there now look more like,</v>

946
00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Speaker 3>but no scientologists allowed to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence Wright's book.</v>

947
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did an excellent job of </v>

948
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 3>insulating people if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I were like friends,</v>

949
00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

950
00:44:10.431 --> 00:44:14.210
<v Speaker 3>And you had concern for me in St log and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you came and you said,</v>

952
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.160

<v Speaker 3>I've read going clear and I want to know</v>

953
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:20.720

<v Speaker 3>daughter,</v>

955
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say joe,</v>

956
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 3>you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good person.</v>

957
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're white.</v>

958
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Like come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

959
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do drawing.</v>

960
00:44:30.921 --> 00:44:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

961
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't steal.</v>

962
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing just respect the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something I believe is helping </v>

963
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:41.301
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you ask me to look at </v>

964
00:44:41.301 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 1>something that's anti my church or anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing?</v>

965
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Or you would approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

966
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And you would accept a Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

967
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:50.301
<v Speaker 1>she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is messed up of me to be telling her </v>

968
00:44:50.301 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 1>these things when she is a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hernia.</v>

969
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Angelo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

970
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't push it.</v>

971
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would respect me enough because you </v>

972
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 1>would know me enough to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I want to do that to her.</v>

973
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disrespectful.</v>

974
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like that happens pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much across the board?</v>

975
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was outside,</v>

976
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

977
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what you're trained to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're working constantly with people</v>

978
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that are not in the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your assets.</v>

979
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.890
<v Speaker 1>How many people are going to come up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and say,</v>

980
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think you're.</v>

981
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you're in a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

982
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.250
<v Speaker 1>in your position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few,</v>

983
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you were wanting to stars of the</v>

984
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 1>show and everyone will do that from time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to time.</v>

985
00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Quite a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

986
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

987
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

988
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he's on a set,</v>

989
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 1>is it all like he's doing mission </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible shrimp like that?</v>

990
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it all scientology employees that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly surrounding him?</v>

991
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got like this wall of </v>

992
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:41.240
<v Speaker 1>installation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

993
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's all scientology people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

994
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer,</v>

995
00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be scientologists.</v>

996
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

997
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

998
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 1>They're not invading Tom Space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be disrespectful to</v>

999
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:55.371
<v Speaker 1>their lead actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to go up to tom and </v>

1000
00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:55.371
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey tom,</v>

1001
00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:58.761
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know that our affiliation with </v>

1002
00:45:58.761 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 1>you and what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the scientology thing,</v>

1003
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna rock the boat.</v>

1004
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:06.570
<v Speaker 1>They hired him as an actor and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way Tom Cruise is,</v>

1005
00:46:06.961 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1006
00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I get out of him as he's just </v>

1007
00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:12.460
<v Speaker 1>super focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very intense,</v>

1008
00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:17.060
<v Speaker 1>turned on intense guy and it probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits him having all these servants </v>

1009
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:22.191
<v Speaker 1>take care of all his every need so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could focus directly on his thing and </v>

1010
00:46:22.191 --> 00:46:26.061
<v Speaker 1>just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for him it's probably 100 percent </v>

1011
00:46:26.061 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1012
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a world that's tailor made to him </v>

1013
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>

1014
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is scientology a what,</v>

1015
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 1>a rare position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1016
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:41.001
<v Speaker 1>It is for any human to ever find </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in without like being like </v>

1017
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Speaker 1>the conqueror of a country or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that right now.</v>

1018
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1019
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make the distinction between,</v>

1020
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1021
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.810
<v Speaker 1>when you gained some success in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>business thing,</v>

1022
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able to surround yourself with an</v>

1023
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:55.971
<v Speaker 1>assistant and people to help you to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life easier so you could focus on </v>

1024
00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 1>your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1025
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.470
<v Speaker 1>but this is something totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because behind closed doors,</v>

1026
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

1027
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting and being a different way and you</v>

1028
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1029
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows it and anybody in scientology </v>

1030
00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 1>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it is a,</v>

1031
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it is about the mission of scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything is justified.</v>

1032
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.270
<v Speaker 1>So behind closed doors though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is he different?</v>

1033
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It is nothing out align.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1034
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that would upset him.</v>

1035
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1036
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you have act and be a certain</v>

1037
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>way around him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot,</v>

1038
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't step out of line out of </v>

1039
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.141
<v Speaker 2>the bounds of the policies of the church</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you or you will be dealt with and </v>

1040
00:47:40.141 --> 00:47:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you will be dealt with swiftly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1041
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.160
<v Speaker 2>within your church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be quite abusive to </v>

1042
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was punished for a,</v>

1043
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:55.620
<v Speaker 2>basically following my own policy of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>church defending my church and I can't </v>

1044
00:47:55.841 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 2>be friends with somebody who you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be around,</v>

1045
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:03.421
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be around that and you're </v>

1046
00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:03.421
<v Speaker 2>getting punished by your church because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1047
00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that again,</v>

1048
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:05.920
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't really even the reason why I</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1049
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dealing with that.</v>

1050
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I was dealing with being interrogated at</v>
<v Speaker 2>my expense.</v>

1051
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:15.361
<v Speaker 2>We're talking hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars and you've given us millions of </v>

1052
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:15.361
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions,</v>

1053
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million and now they're turning around.</v>

1054
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these hate websites they </v>

1055
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.591
<v Speaker 2>create on everybody within minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inquiry and they can't really say </v>

1056
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:28.210
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1057
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do anything to say a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1058
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.330
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to Joe,</v>

1059
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I said it in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1060
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all those things.</v>

1061
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You even,</v>

1062
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 2>if you catch me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1063
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.120
<v Speaker 2>in a situation or my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't change anything about what </v>

1064
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't change a damn thing.</v>

1065
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what their intention </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to try to,</v>

1066
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my husband sometimes sings in a salsa </v>

1067
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.091
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they're going to catch </v>

1068
00:48:54.091 --> 00:48:54.091
<v Speaker 2>him with a girl somewhere dancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocently.</v>

1069
00:48:54.091 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is yes,</v>

1070
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:58.390
<v Speaker 2>you can do all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hire Pi to follow us.</v>

1071
00:48:58.391 --> 00:49:03.391
<v Speaker 2>You can get us in situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does that change anything trying to </v>

1072
00:49:03.391 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>discredit you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter what you're saying</v>

1073
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1074
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it.</v>

1075
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.290
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that bothers me is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become my crusades.</v>

1076
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Say it's not my crusade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my responsibility.</v>

1077
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:21.030
<v Speaker 2>And I feel other people need to step up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and take some responsibility.</v>

1078
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the only one saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1079
00:49:25.371 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other actors,</v>

1080
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.340
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1081
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 2>officials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

1082
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to not make it about me.</v>

1083
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Get some bowls and say what you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1084
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I was on 20 slash 20 right with Dan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris and it's the parent company to a </v>

1085
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 2>and a and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1086
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I did the show for somebody else and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Dan Harris.</v>

1087
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of that?</v>

1088
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of Dan?</v>

1089
00:49:49.631 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be impartial.</v>

1090
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be impartial about abuse or </v>

1091
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.510
<v Speaker 2>you impartial about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I named a few things and he went,</v>

1092
00:49:58.511 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1093
00:49:59.141 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1094
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being an asshole.</v>

1095
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth of the matter is,</v>

1096
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I do think that of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this industry,</v>

1097
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:12.061
<v Speaker 2>I think this is like a bolus industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's people who have some bowls </v>

1098
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Adam Corolla,</v>

1099
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few people who are in the </v>

1100
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 2>public eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry about that,</v>

1101
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.740
<v Speaker 2>who are in the public eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have had the balls to have an </v>

1102
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:25.740
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make it about me.</v>

1103
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>These things are screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people's</v>

1104
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>lives are being hurt and damage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>

1105
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:35.891
<v Speaker 3>you're defrauding people at a millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of dollars by your abusive policies.</v>

1106
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make things confidential.</v>

1107
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these policies don't exist.</v>

1108
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you say they exist there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can google them and see that they </v>

1109
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.421
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in their defense is a magnet because</v>

1110
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:55.541
<v Speaker 3>you are a famous person and so it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it much easier to concentrate on the </v>

1111
00:50:55.541 --> 00:50:58.480
<v Speaker 3>whole situation through you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1112
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Because of the fact that you're a famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>person because of the fact that you </v>

1113
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.990
<v Speaker 3>lived most of your life in the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it very convenient to go </v>

1114
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:12.581
<v Speaker 3>through you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think it's a bad </v>

1115
00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:12.581
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm saying,</v>

1116
00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:14.260
<v Speaker 3>if I say this connection as a policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1117
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:19.270
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they sit and then the next headline </v>

1118
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 3>is Leah Remini alleges that </v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnection.</v>

1119
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not alleging anything.</v>

1120
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1121
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1122
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that I'm saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're protecting themselves legally.</v>

1123
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1124
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:29.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1125
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:34.871
<v Speaker 3>it's available for anyone to see what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they probably don't want to get </v>

1126
00:51:34.871 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 3>sued if they get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in their policies.</v>

1127
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1128
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.300
<v Speaker 3>And maybe they would say that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreting it or disconnection and </v>

1129
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:48.221
<v Speaker 3>suppressives and it says exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the church labels a suppressive person </v>

1130
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.380
<v Speaker 3>that you are only your only option is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnect.</v>

1131
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 3>So you have children disconnecting from </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own mothers and fathers.</v>

1132
00:51:55.670 --> 00:52:00.670
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of your show to see the damage </v>

1133
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 3>that caused and see how devastated these</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents were and family members were.</v>

1134
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.480
<v Speaker 3>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really horrible.</v>

1135
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:11.750
<v Speaker 3>And you know what people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew the policy existed right when </v>

1136
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 3>you were in scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why you guys so surprise?</v>

1137
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:19.090
<v Speaker 3>We were taught a suppressive person is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an evil with horns like Hitler.</v>

1138
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking it's my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter,</v>

1139
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 3>but when you get pulled in for something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

1140
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 3>which is what they did in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to get me to disconnect from my</v>

1141
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:36.161
<v Speaker 3>stepfather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they tried to get my stepfather to </v>

1142
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:38.771
<v Speaker 3>disconnect from my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they did this whole thing with </v>

1143
00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:38.771
<v Speaker 3>her stepfather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who brought you in the first place?</v>

1144
00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:38.771
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1145
00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 3>This is another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another grandmother visit.</v>

1146
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just getting crazy.</v>

1147
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1148
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a naughty naughty,</v>

1149
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 3>but she's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's been married to George,</v>

1150
00:52:46.941 --> 00:52:47.610
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1151
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her husband for 30 years.</v>

1152
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:52.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1153
00:52:52.011 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1154
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:56.050
<v Speaker 3>the other guy ended up leaving us there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got us into scientology.</v>

1155
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Then he took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1156
00:52:58.461 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 3>So talk me through your return.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you go to Florida,</v>

1158
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 3>you spend three fucking months getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>grilled everyday,</v>

1159
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:15.130
<v Speaker 3>putting the pressure on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's been a proven tactic of </v>

1160
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:18.820
<v Speaker 3>interrogations that it's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>questioned by people that really like </v>

1161
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.760
<v Speaker 3>look at the ethical implications of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrogation.</v>

1162
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you put so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>intention on</v>

1163
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
<v Speaker 4>someone about a certain thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes them so uncomfortable that it </v>

1164
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 4>changes their perception of things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where they're willing to admit</v>

1165
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things that may or may not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

1166
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 4>Just to get the interrogation.</v>

1167
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I did.</v>

1168
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1170
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come back.</v>

1171
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like take a little bit of a </v>

1172
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.030
<v Speaker 2>hiatus from scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not creating.</v>

1173
00:53:46.031 --> 00:53:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1174
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.910
<v Speaker 4>when you say take a hiatus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing the daily thing</v>

1175
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.570
<v Speaker 2>going in all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often are you going in then?</v>

1176
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like once every month.</v>

1177
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Once a month instead of every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>

1178
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 2>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they got me back.</v>

1179
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Then they have a big meeting with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

1180
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:04.380
<v Speaker 2>we want you to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know you're upset.</v>

1181
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Like that whole thing was just screwed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1182
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's just come back and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifics.</v>

1183
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:13.311
<v Speaker 2>What was messed up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to tell me in writing and </v>

1184
00:54:13.311 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 2>then you should also refund all my money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you spent,</v>

1185
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:19.941
<v Speaker 2>that I spent having to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they showed me a policy that there </v>

1186
00:54:19.941 --> 00:54:23.661
<v Speaker 2>are no refunds and if I ask for a refund</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to get declared a </v>

1187
00:54:23.661 --> 00:54:27.561
<v Speaker 2>suppressive person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the money that you spent going </v>

1188
00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Florida and spending three months down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1189
00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what you wanted to refund.</v>

1190
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that money.</v>

1191
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Millions that you gave to them over </v>
<v Speaker 2>because listen in in,</v>

1192
00:54:34.731 --> 00:54:36.120
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their defense,</v>

1193
00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:41.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's right to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money back on something that you feel </v>

1194
00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:41.121
<v Speaker 2>you've received,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1195
00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:45.040
<v Speaker 2>A service you've received.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem that I have is scientology is a </v>

1196
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 2>pay before you go proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

1197
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:52.550
<v Speaker 2>if not tens of thousands of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have money sitting on account that they </v>

1198
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.270
<v Speaker 2>can't get because they have a refund </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1199
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just call the church right now </v>

1200
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 2>and say I want a refund because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not allowed to talk to me.</v>

1201
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's a catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're only person that you could </v>

1202
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 2>talk to in the church is the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>deals with refunds,</v>

1203
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 2>but they can't talk to you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're declared an enemy to the church.</v>

1204
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:14.330
<v Speaker 2>So they're holding millions and millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars of people's money that they </v>

1205
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:19.941
<v Speaker 2>can't get back because no lawyer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take on the Church of </v>

1206
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Scientology for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're talking to the average guy </v>

1207
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>who has fifty thousand one hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars on account.</v>

1208
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>He or she is never gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See again.</v>

1209
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1210
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1211
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1212
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.710
<v Speaker 4>you get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have this meeting with you.</v>

1213
00:55:32.711 --> 00:55:34.330
<v Speaker 4>You say that you want to get your money </v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1214
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:36.640
<v Speaker 4>they won't give you your money back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then how does it go from there?</v>

1215
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

1216
00:55:37.521 --> 00:55:38.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1217
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be interrogated because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are now acting as an enemy to the </v>

1218
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 2>church because you were asking for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money back.</v>

1219
00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I said,</v>

1220
00:55:47.781 --> 00:55:52.781
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it just kind of out opened up a </v>

1221
00:55:52.781 --> 00:55:52.820
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a wound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I started saying where shelly,</v>

1222
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I want an answer where shelly is,</v>

1223
00:55:55.401 --> 00:55:58.160
<v Speaker 2>because I had been writing her shelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscavige correct,</v>

1224
00:55:58.161 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 2>the leader's wife and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1225
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:04.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna get bad for you guys because </v>

1226
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.391
<v Speaker 2>now I started going on the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I started seeing stories of senior </v>

1227
00:56:07.391 --> 00:56:11.561
<v Speaker 2>executives getting beaten in the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Debbie Cook and Mike Rinder and Tom</v>

1228
00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:17.411
<v Speaker 2>devopped and I was seeing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>names and I was eating that they were </v>

1229
00:56:17.411 --> 00:56:19.370
<v Speaker 2>actually beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically beaten and for what reason?</v>

1230
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>For looking the wrong way at David </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscavige for signing,</v>

1231
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 2>for siding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for rolling their eyes,</v>

1232
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:31.950
<v Speaker 2>for being tired for like yawning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of them or something.</v>

1233
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone beats you,</v>

1234
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or has or he has somebody beat you.</v>

1235
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.240
<v Speaker 2>And Mike Rinder and Marty Rathbun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're part of that right foot.</v>

1236
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We're part of that senior executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>strata that was up in Riverside county </v>

1237
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:48.300
<v Speaker 2>where they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1238
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.980
<v Speaker 2>a place called gold gold base and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where these incidents were allegedly </v>

1239
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.810
<v Speaker 2>taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1240
00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 2>so I started googling it and I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>going into the church and saying,</v>

1241
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:05.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm googling this information and I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know why these people are saying the </v>

1242
00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.930
<v Speaker 2>same thing and the stories are over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

1243
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm seeing stories of families </v>
<v Speaker 2>being declared suppressive people,</v>

1244
00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Their Ota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1245
00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:18.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're high up in the church and their </v>

1246
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:18.551
<v Speaker 2>families are being forced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're,</v>

1247
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:19.730
<v Speaker 2>then you're presented with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1248
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>this is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look Martin,</v>

1249
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>

1250
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Render admitted that he beat people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mardi Gras.</v>

1251
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the difference.</v>

1252
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:32.520
<v Speaker 2>They're admitting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are admitting that they did this </v>

1253
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.881
<v Speaker 2>under David miscavige's direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are saying that they're lying,</v>

1254
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 2>but they're not lying about they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

1255
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 2>but they're lying about having received </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1256
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1257
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>

1258
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>these stories kept coming up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept.</v>

1259
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.130
<v Speaker 2>When I would ask a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would put me in a room and go,</v>

1260
00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:52.900
<v Speaker 2>what are your crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you talking to?</v>

1261
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Why you talking to enemies of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>church?</v>

1262
00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:58.440
<v Speaker 2>And it was just at my questions were </v>
<v Speaker 2>never answered and I said,</v>

1263
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 2>so does this church ever do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong?</v>

1264
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Does this church ever do anything wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is everybody an evil asshole?</v>

1265
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Once they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're telling me?</v>

1266
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen if you said that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother was.</v>

1267
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Then I just got to believe you that my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother is an evil person and all these </v>

1268
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 2>horrible things you're saying about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

1269
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer was don't believe me.</v>

1270
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Believe l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is Ellroy?</v>

1271
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 2>What is elevated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say and then they have the policy out.</v>

1272
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 2>What does elevate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

1273
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 2>read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read this aloud.</v>

1274
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>What don't you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this word mean?</v>

1275
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.500
<v Speaker 2>What does that word mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go look this up.</v>

1276
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 2>You haven't a misunderstood word here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't understand that anybody who</v>

1277
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:41.251
<v Speaker 2>attacks your church is a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the kind of thing you go </v>

1278
00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:46.051
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what you're going through </v>

1279
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:46.051
<v Speaker 2>when he came back to La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you slowly started separating.</v>

1280
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they ever give you one of those big </v>

1281
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 2>gold metals like Tom Cruise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got.</v>

1282
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I never got one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did get a huge award for donating </v>

1283
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.720
<v Speaker 2>another million to church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1284
00:58:56.721 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1285
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:02.510
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy to me that everybody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves is somebody who has an ax to </v>

1286
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.840
<v Speaker 2>grind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apostate,</v>

1287
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.590
<v Speaker 2>a bigot because I've been called a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigot.</v>

1288
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

1289
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to the one place you can go to,</v>

1290
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 2>which is don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't disrespect my religious beliefs,</v>

1291
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they can call you a bigot.</v>

1292
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm for religious freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1293
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.600
<v Speaker 2>for the first segment like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're hiding behind.</v>

1294
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>And I'm calling bullshit every celebrity</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did a to Joe.</v>

1297

1303
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 1>when the whole thing first started going</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1304
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1346
01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this David miscavige wife situation </v>

1347
01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>didn't get resolved.</v>

1348
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I filed a missing persons report with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the LAPD.</v>

1349
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I found some pictures of the </v>

1350
01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>guy who was in charge of my case </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking into scientology event on human</v>

1351
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1352
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Dawson at the lapd police </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer being paid to speak at this </v>

1353
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>celebrity center at a human trafficking </v>
<v Speaker 1>event that celebrity center,</v>

1354
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:04.631
<v Speaker 1>Scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems a massive conflict of </v>

1355
01:02:04.631 --> 01:02:04.631
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>after that I called a that do all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden lieutenant to us in and I said,</v>

1359
01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:17.351
<v Speaker 1>so what's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I had given a letter with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>police report that said it was too </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelly,</v>

1361
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:21.540

<v Speaker 1>shelly,</v>

1362

<v Speaker 1>What's going on there is wrong.</v>

1364
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea because let me tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said they have no telephone.</v>

1365
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>They have no mail in or out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not allowed to leave the base.</v>

1366
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>If they leave that base of at Riverside </v>
<v Speaker 1>County,</v>

1367
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>they are accompanied by security or </v>
<v Speaker 1>handler.</v>

1368
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>So you think she's a prisoner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1369
01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1370
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>if she's alive and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1371
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a best case scenario would be yes.</v>

1372
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:52.341
<v Speaker 1>That she's being held prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not by her own mind if she's alive </v>

1373
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1374
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>So you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What didn't she released some sort of a </v>

1375
01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>statement or someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone did.</v>

1376
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who was from to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your accusations,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1401
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>because this is not free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to spend more money on a lawyer to</v>

1402
01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>do a followup on the public information </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts.</v>

1403
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I asked specific questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did you see?</v>

1404
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you see her?</v>

1406
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Didn't give me any information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go,</v>

1407

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1409
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 1>With paid the two more dollars and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thousands of dollars,</v>

1410
01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>it costs me to get a lawyer to draft up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the letter,</v>

1411
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>so it's still ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't have answers,</v>

1412
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>so she just sort of vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She stopped going to events.</v>

1413
01:04:27.971 --> 01:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>You stop being,</v>

1443
01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being funny.</v>

1444
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 1>And they get paid $15 a week and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>work from the moment they get up to </v>

1445
01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.900
<v Speaker 1>midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work astronomical hours.</v>

1446
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.260
<v Speaker 1>These are called sea org members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about average </v>

1447
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>scientologists and explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain to me the car,</v>

1448
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 1>because was that established when l Ron </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard was evading taxes?</v>

1449
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.750
<v Speaker 1>He was on a ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1450
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And He created the ship called the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>winds and whatever.</v>

1451
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 1>That's not called the free winds and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is called the free winds now,</v>

1452
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 1>but that's where they deliver the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level of,</v>

1453
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.420
<v Speaker 1>of Scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their Ota,</v>

1454
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the Ota Ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before that,</v>

1455
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the name of his boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was called the Apollo.</v>

1456
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That was a part of going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was hilarious.</v>

1457
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:43.410
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1458
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 1>who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the writers are one of the Haggis</v>

1459
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>when he received like the highest level </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that wasn't even the highest level,</v>

1460
01:06:52.391 --> 01:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't mean that was ot three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I read it,</v>

1462
01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1463
01:06:57.521 --> 01:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to go into a secure room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk us through that.</v>

1464
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get invited.</v>

1465
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to get an invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had been scientology for years.</v>

1466
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>You'd spent a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1467
01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>most scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1468
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 1>most scientologists don't even get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this most,</v>

1469
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>most don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1470
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to be wealthy to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you have to be wealthy.</v>

1471
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of times what they do that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new scam is you got to go.</v>

1472
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You get to a level and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we messed that up.</v>

1473
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You have to go back down at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>

1474
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>You have to Redo that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about that on your </v>

1477
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:36.991
<v Speaker 1>now David miscavige rewrites things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says he found it in a vault somewhere </v>

1478
01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>and we all believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1479
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all believe it because we want to </v>

1480
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talk me through.</v>

1481

<v Speaker 1>She was what's considered a highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained auditor,</v>

1607
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but she hadn't read this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course she read it.</v>

1608
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:27.240
<v Speaker 1>She was just there to see my excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1609
01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1610
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>She was just there as a spectator to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>her daughter received the answers were </v>

1611
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:37.881
<v Speaker 1>super skeptical or ra supervisor comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and he goes,</v>

1612
01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>what don't you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1613
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1614
01:13:41.681 --> 01:13:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't love that.</v>

1615
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1616
01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I just got to tell you I'm not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this is what it was.</v>

1617
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.480
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1618
01:13:48.481 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need to do it.</v>

1619
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's the answer that's given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1620
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need to do it.</v>

1621
01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:01.010
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to go and audit this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go and do it on yourself.</v>

1622
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Talk to these beans on the meter by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1623
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1624
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 1>on the meter meeting you hold the cans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cans,</v>

1625
01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they looks like.</v>

1626
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It looks like soup cans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd drained all the soup from a </v>

1627
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>suit can and it had a string attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's connected to some.</v>

1628
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just google what scientology,</v>

1629
01:14:19.201 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>ie meter a meter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1630
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to hold the meter and </v>

1631
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.201
<v Speaker 1>discuss this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking there's just so now </v>

1632
01:14:28.201 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go get your materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after you've been checked out on this</v>

1633
01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:31.810
<v Speaker 1>and they get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what it is,</v>

1634
01:14:31.811 --> 01:14:36.811
<v Speaker 1>then you go back to the window and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you your actual what you're </v>

1635
01:14:36.811 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do with this information.</v>

1636
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So it'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a piece of paper and I'll say,</v>

1637
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>ask this question and then look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meter and what the answer is.</v>

1638
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Whatever answer comes to your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down.</v>

1639
01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you're doing is awakening these </v>

1640
01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.730
<v Speaker 1>things to talk to them really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1641
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And so let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically saying like,</v>

1642
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:00.820
<v Speaker 1>go be free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1643
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 1>This is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1644
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a scientologist and I heard </v>

1645
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that this was a story I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1646
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So I would go to the Internet and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] three story,</v>

1647
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know if it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't verify it.</v>

1648
01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most people who go,</v>

1649
01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:21.451
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit because they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're looking at </v>

1650
01:15:21.451 --> 01:15:21.451
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1651
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>There's no one to verify it with.</v>

1652
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.560
<v Speaker 1>So if I went to my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say before I got to this level,</v>

1653
01:15:26.561 --> 01:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1654
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.120
<v Speaker 1>you're told to lie to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell people what the answers </v>

1655
01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 1>are because they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>pneumonia.</v>

1656
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.870
<v Speaker 1>You get pneumonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surely will die.</v>

1657
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times when I lied to the </v>

1658
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>prize and then they confronted me on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1659
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>why'd you lie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1660
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I had to to save your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can only give you cancer.</v>

1661
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you were about to go to ot three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you went online and you </v>

1662
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 1>investigated what is ot three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you read a bunch of stuff about</v>

1663
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:54.790
<v Speaker 1>these little beings in your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then ask your mom.</v>

1664
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Your mom would have to lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would lie to me as she did,</v>

1665
01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:00.460
<v Speaker 1>as she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after you got through this,</v>

1666
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.330
<v Speaker 1>what made you do four and five?</v>

1667
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:07.300
<v Speaker 1>There's always the carrot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wait it just by the way,</v>

1668
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:09.400
<v Speaker 1>here's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They set up that year,</v>

1669
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the auditor now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

1670
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you're auditing these things in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1671
01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you're now the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go,</v>

1672
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 1>they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your hat on,</v>

1673
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 1>like it's your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to believe anything,</v>

1674
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you just need to audit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to do your job as an </v>

1675
01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:26.320
<v Speaker 1>auditor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're called.</v>

1676
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Auditor's people who are the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you into session and scientology,</v>

1677
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like you're in a leadership </v>

1678
01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're doing these things a favor,</v>

1679
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1680
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's true.</v>

1681
01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1682
01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I do sometimes hear voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1683
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a moment with yourself and </v>

1684
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be really kind of crazy.</v>

1685
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're like,</v>

1686
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is an answer.</v>

1687
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sick because it speaks to a side of</v>

1688
01:16:49.601 --> 01:16:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you that wants answers about life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1689
01:16:52.271 --> 01:16:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1690
01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>this is some crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1691
01:16:54.701 --> 01:16:59.701
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't even the people that know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1692
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe what you want to believe at </v>

1693
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:07.351
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it feel to you at the moment like </v>

1694
01:17:07.351 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you just keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into place,</v>

1695
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 1>then I'll make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm confused now,</v>

1696
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but if I contemplate this and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it over,</v>

1697
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 1>eventually I'm going to receive enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1698
01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.700
<v Speaker 1>This is all going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1699
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I was a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand.</v>

1700
01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time I had talked to a friend about </v>

1701
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1702
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:30.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard something about some genius </v>

1703
01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.080
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She pulled me into celebrity center so </v>

1704
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>fast into a secured room and she handed </v>
<v Speaker 1>me my aunt.</v>

1705
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:42.071
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you ever say that word outside of </v>

1706
01:17:42.071 --> 01:17:42.071
<v Speaker 1>secured room?</v>

1707
01:17:42.071 --> 01:17:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a knowledge report on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1708
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:48.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never say that word out loud in a </v>

1709
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 1>room that's not secured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1710
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And never seen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she wrote a report on the report.</v>

1711
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.240
<v Speaker 1>She wrote a report on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got sent to what's called ethics,</v>

1712
01:17:56.241 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 1>which is like the Justice Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities that have of scientology and</v>

1713
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:06.011
<v Speaker 1>they said they brought me into another </v>
<v Speaker 1>secured room because they have to get </v>

1714
01:18:06.011 --> 01:18:06.650
<v Speaker 1>somebody who knows this information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

1715
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 1>never ever say that would say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never confirm it.</v>

1716
01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Never deny it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never give that information out,</v>

1717
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.560
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just never discuss it.</v>

1718
01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Just say I'd never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sound crazy.</v>

1719
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we all say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sound crazy or you know,</v>

1720
01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 1>properly done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it.</v>

1721
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:28.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'll get it if it's properly </v>

1722
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:28.810
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people didn't do it properly.</v>

1723
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:29.660
<v Speaker 1>That's why they didn't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>

1724
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a line that you cross.</v>

1725
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:34.910
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my life,</v>

1726
01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:36.770
<v Speaker 1>this is scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what I believe.</v>

1727
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you cross this line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1728
01:18:39.321 --> 01:18:40.550
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1729
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

1730
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 1>that line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bridge that you cross and your mind</v>

1731
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:50.140
<v Speaker 1>is a very distinct transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1732
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:54.260
<v Speaker 1>what was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that transition like?</v>

1733
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your life like now?</v>

1734
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1735
01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 1>how long ago did you leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>July will be four years.</v>

1736
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1737
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1738
01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>it's really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1739
01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1740
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.630
<v Speaker 1>finding myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still like,</v>

1741
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I believe,</v>

1742
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I some bullshit?</v>

1743
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Am I a person that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're saying,</v>

1744
01:19:18.081 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>loves a fight because I don't want that.</v>

1745
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that person who loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight just to fight.</v>

1746
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to be on the path of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being righteous.</v>

1747
01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to be who I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1748
01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:34.151
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who I really am is sometimes an </v>

1749
01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:34.151
<v Speaker 1>asshole Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I am,</v>

1750
01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I have a horrible temper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1751
01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>

1752
01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I feel like I'm like an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school mafia person stuck in a female,</v>

1753
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but I have really extreme thoughts about</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and I'm finding who I am.</v>

1754
01:19:45.861 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding out what I really believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of times I don't know.</v>

1755
01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I believe in that?</v>

1756
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told that everybody smokes pot as </v>

1757
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:55.180
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe that?</v>

1758
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who cheats is evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible and just lost.</v>

1759
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe that other religions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost?</v>

1760
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe that everybody needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I Willi I'm searching.</v>

1761
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:04.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to reevaluate your entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleet.</v>

1762
01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a big part of my day.</v>

1763
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Remember he gave</v>

1764
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 2>me a mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me purpose and that's what I hear a</v>

1765
01:20:12.331 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 2>lot from scientologists is excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

1766
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Not just hearing their pain of losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their families and everything they've </v>

1767
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:23.361
<v Speaker 2>ever known but not having purpose when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wake up in the morning like you </v>

1768
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have purpose joe,</v>

1769
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:30.390
<v Speaker 2>we have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God for them but this was so much </v>

1770
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for your children's children.</v>

1771
01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 4>So giant factor for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:39.830
<v Speaker 4>I have some friends that were deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in the mormon religion and </v>

1773
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 4>they're not anymore and it was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird because we went to dinner once and</v>

1774
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 4>they were saying do you believe in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher power?</v>

1775
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.130
<v Speaker 4>And I said it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I don't,</v>

1776
01:20:49.131 --> 01:20:54.131
<v Speaker 4>but I don't believe in anything that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have any evidence of its entirely </v>

1777
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:57.801
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think the universe is an </v>

1778
01:20:57.801 --> 01:21:00.051
<v Speaker 4>incredible mystery and I think the life </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself in consciousness is an amazing </v>

1779
01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 4>mystery and I don't think we have all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the answers.</v>

1780
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:07.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think an ant can understand a </v>

1781
01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:07.470
<v Speaker 4>cell phone and I don't think I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand the universe.</v>

1782
01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I just think my brain is not evolved </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1783
01:21:09.871 --> 01:21:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't think our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1784
01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.880
<v Speaker 4>our understanding has reached a point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we can really accurately describe </v>

1785
01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.770
<v Speaker 4>what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And their answer was like,</v>

1786
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:20.640
<v Speaker 4>how do you get up in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1787
01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 4>I love life has I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like drinking nice wine.</v>

1788
01:21:24.091 --> 01:21:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I like having dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like being with my friends.</v>

1789
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I like a gel and not everybody has that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they probably should find some </v>

1790
01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.510
<v Speaker 4>things that they enjoy about the life.</v>

1791
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing is finding those </v>

1792
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:39.711
<v Speaker 2>things for st intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot of my friends who didn't</v>

1793
01:21:40.231 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 2>really know what I was going through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>church go,</v>

1794
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:46.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've already kind of childish at </v>

1795
01:21:46.671 --> 01:21:46.671
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1796
01:21:46.671 --> 01:21:49.281
<v Speaker 2>because I never went to dinner in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties and forties and had wine.</v>

1797
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't go to dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have wine,</v>

1798
01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd get reports written on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1799
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:56.550
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to go to church the next day.</v>

1800
01:21:56.551 --> 01:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going out to dinner after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>king of Queens and enjoying my friends.</v>

1801
01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And if I did Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking they're laws,</v>

1802
01:22:03.761 --> 01:22:05.880
<v Speaker 2>they need scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1803
01:22:05.881 --> 01:22:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I was never really there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never really part of a,</v>

1804
01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like living for the first time.</v>

1805
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:16.131
<v Speaker 2>But I do have faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that I have found </v>

1806
01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.420
<v Speaker 2>and not in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a,</v>

1807
01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:23.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm in another cult way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in just I had faith for the first </v>

1808
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in any one thing.</v>

1809
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I believe in a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that faith,</v>

1810
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 2>having faith is a big thing.</v>

1811
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:34.930
<v Speaker 4>These people that I was friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still friends with this.</v>

1812
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 4>This conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

1813
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:41.661
<v Speaker 4>Got a little weird that night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it got way weirder years later </v>

1814
01:22:41.661 --> 01:22:44.750
<v Speaker 4>because they wanted to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean they left the Mormon </v>

1815
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Church?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1816
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 4>because then they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they became untethered.</v>

1817
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:49.080
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conversation I had with the wife was</v>

1818
01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 4>very strange because she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in,</v>

1819
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:55.440
<v Speaker 4>in doctrinated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this fundamentalist religion.</v>

1820
01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:57.270
<v Speaker 4>And she goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that I'm not in it,</v>

1821
01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:59.190
<v Speaker 4>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to believe.</v>

1822
01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And I realized that my mindset is kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of fucked up because I,</v>

1823
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm indoctrinated like my brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed</v>

1824
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>as a young age believing nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never questioning it.</v>

1825
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I feel very vulnerable,</v>

1826
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 1>very susceptible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1827
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the right cult came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could scoop me up.</v>

1828
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:20.641
<v Speaker 1>And she was laughing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't laughing about thing on </v>

1829
01:23:20.641 --> 01:23:20.900
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why like when I,</v>

1830
01:23:20.901 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1831
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to tell me nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be told a damn thing.</v>

1832
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been told my whole life what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to think.</v>

1833
01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>So I've gotten the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't tell me what I need to do and</v>

1834
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:37.710
<v Speaker 1>it it at the pendulum swing is far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any.</v>

1835
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Let me go into the DMV when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to stand there.</v>

1836
01:23:40.241 --> 01:23:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to stand anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need.</v>

1837
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need my license renewed and then</v>

1838
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm that person.</v>

1839
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to destroy my whole day and get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket because I don't want to be told </v>

1840
01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:52.000
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't talk to me.</v>

1841
01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1842
01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you know your child and don't talk to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1843
01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much that way.</v>

1844
01:23:57.251 --> 01:23:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have shorter now.</v>

1845
01:23:58.421 --> 01:24:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit what you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nails.</v>

1846
01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I want them that they're slightly longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>than average because it's purposeful and</v>

1847
01:24:07.151 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 1>when I don't want them anymore I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them.</v>

1848
01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:14.640
<v Speaker 1>But that's just a small scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want people telling me what </v>

1849
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I should think anymore and let me find </v>
<v Speaker 1>my way.</v>

1850
01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1851
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but I want to find my own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of reestablishing your own personal</v>

1852
01:24:23.111 --> 01:24:24.730
<v Speaker 1>sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

1853
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

1854
01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Piss some people off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

1855
01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to make a lot of mistakes.</v>

1856
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to not be the perfect person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think I am or want me to be,</v>

1857
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.700
<v Speaker 1>but I got to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you learn.</v>

1858
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't able to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1859
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.160
<v Speaker 1>do it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the way we do it.</v>

1860
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 1>We don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>

1861
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always a little bit of a rebel in,</v>

1862
01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but I thought everybody was being held </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this higher standard.</v>

1863
01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:54.541
<v Speaker 1>They weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was finding out other celebrities was </v>

1864
01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and then going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

1865
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1866
01:24:56.590 --> 01:25:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Doing their purification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Run down 100 times because that's when </v>

1867
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that's in the beginning steps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>

1868
01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to do what's called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purification rundown.</v>

1875
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and about 40 years of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty,</v>

1876
01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:26.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of work.</v>

1877
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Still work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1878
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>basically a purification rundown is </v>

1880
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:35.941
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to sweat out all of the </v>

1881
01:25:35.941 --> 01:25:37.921
<v Speaker 1>toxins lodged in your fatty tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is,</v>

1882
01:25:38.561 --> 01:25:43.561
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you taking large amounts of value sin </v>

1883
01:25:43.561 --> 01:25:43.561
<v Speaker 1>and they claim you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1884
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you're running out like a Suntan from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from when you're a kid and from other </v>

1885
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:52.330
<v Speaker 1>lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's yes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Flash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and hot and yes,</v>

1887
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>and you have to sit in the sauna for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five hours of dance,</v>

1888
01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 1>a five hour thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was finding out,</v>

1889
01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1890
01:26:02.231 --> 01:26:04.760
<v Speaker 1>why was that prison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was smoking pot to smoke pot,</v>

1891
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1892
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been smoking pot this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1893
01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people do and I'm learning that </v>

1894
01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:15.281
<v Speaker 1>other people were smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing other drugs and then going in the </v>

1895
01:26:15.281 --> 01:26:15.281
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1896
01:26:15.281 --> 01:26:15.830
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was an option for me.</v>

1897
01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I was living by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1898
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm going through now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm smoking pot,</v>

1899
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:26.171
<v Speaker 1>but somebody want to a little bit only </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to be calmer,</v>

1900
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but it might not make it all adds to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1901
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>that I don't want it.</v>

1902
01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Could I have a different effect on every</v>
<v Speaker 4>tool for that shit?</v>

1903
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're definitely not John Old.</v>

1904
01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

1905
01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're alive.</v>

1906
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 4>If you're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can experience the benefits of a </v>

1907
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.931
<v Speaker 4>consciousness enhancing substance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's mushrooms or pot or any </v>

1908
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:44.931
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

1909
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:46.000
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not crazy.</v>

1910
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:49.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1911
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1912
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.100
<v Speaker 1>are you freaking out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd been in a cult.</v>

1913
01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:54.700
<v Speaker 1>You're whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry folks.</v>

1914
01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody insights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All other than the people are going to </v>

1915
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:01.960
<v Speaker 1>tag me in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

1916
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.090
<v Speaker 4>are listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1917
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.310
<v Speaker 4>even the people that are going to attack</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and me,</v>

1918
01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel bad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad for them.</v>

1919
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:12.011
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad for anybody that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack anybody for their beliefs or for </v>

1920
01:27:12.011 --> 01:27:12.011
<v Speaker 4>talking about stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and guess what?</v>

1921
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:17.170
<v Speaker 4>If your religion or your belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easily destroyed that someone </v>

1922
01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:22.061
<v Speaker 4>can have a disparaging opinion about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it that threatens you to the point </v>

1923
01:27:22.061 --> 01:27:24.140
<v Speaker 4>where you want to attack that person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing something wrong,</v>

1924
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 4>you're leading your life wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on the wrong path.</v>

1925
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:32.530
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>different opinions about a lot of </v>

1926
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:32.840
<v Speaker 4>different things and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting things about life,</v>

1927
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't like coconut water.</v>

1928
01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 4>I fucking love coconut water and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to you,</v>

1929
01:27:37.641 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like Cologne.</v>

1930
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it smells like shit.</v>

1931
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.490
<v Speaker 4>We're allowed to have different </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions.</v>

1932
01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:47.491
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the beautiful things </v>
<v Speaker 4>about life and people like different </v>

1933
01:27:47.491 --> 01:27:47.570
<v Speaker 4>kinds of music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different styles of art.</v>

1934
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.630
<v Speaker 4>They like different kinds of houses in </v>
<v Speaker 4>different landscapes.</v>

1935
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:52.190
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things that makes people</v>

1936
01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:53.020
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1937
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.750
<v Speaker 4>So the problem with any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>

1938
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem with what,</v>

1939
01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:03.550
<v Speaker 4>what this represents or any other kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of cult or any other kind of really </v>

1940
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:08.951
<v Speaker 4>rigid structure is that it's human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are very susceptible to those </v>

1941
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:12.440
<v Speaker 4>kinds of routines are very susceptible </v>
<v Speaker 4>to influence.</v>

1942
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:17.590
<v Speaker 4>We're very susceptible to other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>carving out is predetermined patterns of</v>

1943
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:21.920
<v Speaker 4>behavior that you just quickly slot into</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it keeps you from having to form</v>

1944
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:22.960
<v Speaker 4>your own opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1945
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:28.030
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's everything that's wrong when you </v>

1946
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.030
<v Speaker 4>truly believe that you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you do.</v>

1948
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.610
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very easy for people to just</v>

1949
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:36.611
<v Speaker 4>slot themselves into these patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>adopt those opinions as their own </v>

1950
01:28:36.741 --> 01:28:41.741
<v Speaker 4>instead of trying to formulate their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's very complicated to try to </v>

1951
01:28:41.741 --> 01:28:44.411
<v Speaker 4>formulate your own opinions and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be flexible because new </v>

1952
01:28:44.411 --> 01:28:47.621
<v Speaker 4>information comes up and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kind of change them and adjust them </v>

1953
01:28:47.621 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 4>and then recognize that perhaps you like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're recognizing right now that like,</v>

1954
01:28:49.851 --> 01:28:54.851
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've like kind of like I've lived a lie </v>

1955
01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:54.851
<v Speaker 4>for like a long period of time.</v>

1956
01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:57.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't discredit you as a human.</v>

1957
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1958
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 4>and it's very brave of you to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because it</v>

1959
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.980
<v Speaker 1>gives people that are listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of understanding of these </v>

1960
01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:11.691
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that are in their own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's because of whatever </v>

1961
01:29:11.691 --> 01:29:14.601
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fill in the blank and that's the other </v>

1962
01:29:14.601 --> 01:29:16.911
<v Speaker 1>thing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did they have tax exempt </v>

1963
01:29:16.911 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>status because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all the irs,</v>

1964
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:24.201
<v Speaker 1>the answered the irs questions to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that status and one of them is you have </v>

1965
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:29.310
<v Speaker 1>any affiliation with any other God of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they said no,</v>

1966
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 1>they deal with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1967
01:29:30.271 --> 01:29:35.271
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that they are spiritual </v>

1968
01:29:35.271 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 1>beings and they deal with the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1969
01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>and so they answered the questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to be answered for the irs.</v>

1970
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing that any religion gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>ca tax exempt status.</v>

1971
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>All of them are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1972
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make a comment about </v>
<v Speaker 1>other like bonafide religions because I </v>

1973
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:53.700
<v Speaker 1>don't like some of our bonafide.</v>

1974
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1975
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I gonna tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly,</v>

1976
01:29:57.781 --> 01:30:02.781
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really make the distinction </v>

1977
01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:05.631
<v Speaker 1>between an organization that takes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind hostage from the minute you walk in</v>

1978
01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.040
<v Speaker 1>and that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are required to be there 22 and a </v>

1979
01:30:12.121 --> 01:30:15.210
<v Speaker 1>half hours a day that your eternity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>at stake.</v>

1980
01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 1>That the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every man,</v>

1981
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:18.330
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child on this planet,</v>

1982
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 1>they're lives are at stake with what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in scientology.</v>

1983
01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:25.650
<v Speaker 1>So using the pen fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians.</v>

1984
01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:27.930
<v Speaker 1>You said fundamentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1985
01:30:27.931 --> 01:30:31.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm talking about are what,</v>

1986
01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:34.590
<v Speaker 1>what I witnessed as a child with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother.</v>

1987
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.170
<v Speaker 1>My grandma lived down the street from </v>
<v Speaker 1>her church.</v>

1988
01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 1>We would walk in on the way to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1989
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:44.430
<v Speaker 1>sausage and meatballs and things she </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to make her sauce and she'd go in</v>

1990
01:30:44.431 --> 01:30:49.431
<v Speaker 1>and light a candle for her friend Connie</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she'd go in and light a candle </v>

1991
01:30:49.431 --> 01:30:49.830
<v Speaker 1>because I lost my ring.</v>

1992
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Or She'd pray to this scene or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

1993
01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And when I was scared at night she would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1994
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:59.720
<v Speaker 1>pray to this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pray to you know,</v>

1995
01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:02.490
<v Speaker 1>do your cross and God's going to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when you sleep.</v>

1996
01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And here's your angel and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your little car.</v>

1997
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.610
<v Speaker 1>She would give me little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1998
01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the saints on the,</v>

1999
01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.690
<v Speaker 1>on the necklaces and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she'd say,</v>

2000
01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:17.691
<v Speaker 1>and I believed for that night that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene was protecting me or that God was </v>

2001
01:31:17.691 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>protecting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and those comfort,</v>

2002
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 1>it gave me comfort and so that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell my daughter.</v>

2003
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to believe in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I did baptize,</v>

2004
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:28.290
<v Speaker 1>baptize her as a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2005
01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I want you to really find your way with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of spirituality,</v>

2006
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to baptize you to Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel you need some kind of </v>

2007
01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:41.001
<v Speaker 1>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want you to be forced to </v>

2008
01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.101
<v Speaker 1>believe in anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to believe in something </v>

2009
01:31:43.101 --> 01:31:45.960
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to fall for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't have structure as a child.</v>

2010
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I had scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by instructure right.</v>

2011
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real religious base.</v>

2012
01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That religious base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2013
01:31:56.870 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>That's never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a cult and a </v>

2014
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>religion is a beautiful quote.</v>

2015
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 4>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit.</v>

2016
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:06.560
<v Speaker 4>It was created by one person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That person knows it's bullshit in a </v>

2017
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:06.560
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy's dead.</v>

2018
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Why did you come up with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2019
01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:11.750
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2020
01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:14.810
<v Speaker 4>It's just something I read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>

2022
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

2023
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So that was my experience with religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2024
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:24.211
<v Speaker 2>I know people feel very differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>about religion being forced down their </v>

2025
01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:25.100
<v Speaker 2>throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would have kind of loved,</v>

2026
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going with my family every Sunday to </v>

2027
01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:30.120
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

2028
01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it created a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw my father doing that with his</v>

2029
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:37.651
<v Speaker 2>other daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little bit jealous that we </v>

2030
01:32:37.651 --> 01:32:40.261
<v Speaker 2>didn't have that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we didn't get Easter dresses and it </v>

2031
01:32:40.261 --> 01:32:40.430
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a big thing because my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2032
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.660
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have that growing comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2033
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's also the,</v>

2034
01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to look.</v>

2035
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:53.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't cost a quarter of a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

2036
01:32:53.361 --> 01:32:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get up to this level that I explained</v>

2037
01:32:55.781 --> 01:32:57.400
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of it,</v>

2038
01:32:57.430 --> 01:33:01.570
<v Speaker 2>if you have made millions that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to give those millions away,</v>

2039
01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:07.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a requirement that's on a </v>

2040
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:09.910
<v Speaker 2>requirement and in other religions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not allowed to talk to certain </v>

2041
01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:16.261
<v Speaker 2>people that now I understand that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are other calls that do that.</v>

2042
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do call those things a comb </v>

2043
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:24.090
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think any organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any church would tell people who they </v>

2044
01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:28.741
<v Speaker 2>can and cannot talk to what they can and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot read what they should and </v>

2045
01:33:28.741 --> 01:33:33.001
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person should make their own </v>

2046
01:33:33.001 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 2>decisions based on the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's given to them or information that</v>

2047
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:37.070
<v Speaker 2>they find on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2048
01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a pay before you go proposition.</v>

2049
01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:44.380
<v Speaker 2>There are repercussions to leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows that.</v>

2050
01:33:44.381 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I went in and out of the Catholic church</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day and lit a candle.</v>

2051
01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It was calling me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

2052
01:33:51.491 --> 01:33:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Why you not here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who you talking to?</v>

2053
01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 2>You need to come in or we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start working on your family,</v>

2054
01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:57.330
<v Speaker 2>destroying your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

2055
01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.630
<v Speaker 4>does understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2056
01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:04.640
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's different styles of behavior </v>

2057
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.870
<v Speaker 4>patterns that exist in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>religions.</v>

2058
01:34:06.871 --> 01:34:09.200
<v Speaker 4>Like Buddhism is radically different </v>
<v Speaker 4>than Islam,</v>

2059
01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:14.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's different requirements that </v>

2060
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.041
<v Speaker 4>they ask of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it is based on the </v>

2061
01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:16.580
<v Speaker 4>environment that these religions were </v>
<v Speaker 4>established.</v>

2062
01:34:16.581 --> 01:34:19.440
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on how long these things have gone</v>

2063
01:34:19.441 --> 01:34:21.840
<v Speaker 4>on for whether or not the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2064
01:34:21.841 --> 01:34:26.841
<v Speaker 4>the people that are a part of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion have gone through the </v>

2065
01:34:26.841 --> 01:34:26.841
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>

2066
01:34:26.841 --> 01:34:31.101
<v Speaker 4>what different factors played apart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what standards they uphold today and </v>

2067
01:34:31.101 --> 01:34:35.271
<v Speaker 4>what make people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my issue is always with subscribing </v>

2068
01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:39.180
<v Speaker 4>to predetermine patterns of behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideologies.</v>

2069
01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Where were they indoctrinate you on </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific ways to think.</v>

2070
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:43.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.180
<v Speaker 4>That's what a lot of religions are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2072
01:34:45.181 --> 01:34:46.740
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real issue with,</v>

2073
01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:47.730
<v Speaker 4>with human beings.</v>

2074
01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother,</v>

2075
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:54.230
<v Speaker 2>of course was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was yes,</v>

2076
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>exactly where he used to think a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>way about people or a lifestyle</v>

2077
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:04.210
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had the choice to be friends </v>

2078
01:35:04.210 --> 01:35:05.910
<v Speaker 3>with somebody who maybe wasn't those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2079
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Choice.</v>

2080
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:08.410
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2081
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.490
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious that some,</v>

2082
01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 3>especially in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you are describing scientology,</v>

2083
01:35:13.581 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 3>it's far more suppressive than most and </v>
<v Speaker 3>far more rigid in its behavior patterns.</v>

2084
01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they forced you into these behavior </v>

2085
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.331
<v Speaker 3>patterns and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly difficult to break </v>

2086
01:35:25.331 --> 01:35:28.031
<v Speaker 3>behavior patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you believe firmly in </v>

2087
01:35:28.031 --> 01:35:28.340
<v Speaker 3>your heart that this is the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

2088
01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Ben's justified because you're clearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet.</v>

2090
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:33.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing that they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay taxes.</v>

2091
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 3>That's stunning if you look at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine,</v>

2092
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:37.270
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

2093
01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word where there have been judges </v>

2094
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.390
<v Speaker 2>that should have looked into the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said it's not,</v>

2095
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot actually look into the </v>

2096
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 2>doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2097
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 2>but they need to understand that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2098
01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>You need to look into the doctrine where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's abusive and hurting people.</v>

2099
01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.110
<v Speaker 2>If your doctrine calls for you to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2100
01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.450
<v Speaker 2>hurt children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2101
01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>the government does need to step in.</v>

2102
01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.670
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2103
01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2104
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:06.161
<v Speaker 3>it just absolutely this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the accusations about the sea org and </v>

2105
01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:09.961
<v Speaker 3>about people making 15 bucks a week and </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these people that are essentially </v>

2106
01:36:09.961 --> 01:36:11.360
<v Speaker 3>working as indentured servants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not legal.</v>

2107
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:16.510
<v Speaker 3>They sign up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as long as you sign up for it and </v>

2108
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:19.121
<v Speaker 3>sign that billion dollar contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not subject to any minimum wage </v>

2109
01:36:19.121 --> 01:36:19.870
<v Speaker 3>laws or anything along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2110
01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:20.680
<v Speaker 3>At men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2111
01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really that smart enough to speak on</v>

2112
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 3>these things because people think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2113
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:30.100
<v Speaker 3>that my agenda is to take away their tax</v>
<v Speaker 3>exempt status.</v>

2114
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love for that to happen,</v>

2115
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:36.761
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the reason for the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just want to express yourself </v>

2116
01:36:36.761 --> 01:36:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and be honest about your experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 3>help other people experience free.</v>

2117
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 3>These are other people's experiences </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2118
01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.280
<v Speaker 2>But because I know it's true because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced it,</v>

2119
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm cleaning and I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2120
01:36:47.311 --> 01:36:49.200
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to bully somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bully me,</v>

2121
01:36:49.201 --> 01:36:54.201
<v Speaker 2>bully a and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to let these people tell </v>

2122
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:54.201
<v Speaker 2>their stories because they're telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

2123
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:56.760
<v Speaker 2>And if we weren't telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have sued us.</v>

2125
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:58.230
<v Speaker 2>So cut the shit already.</v>

2126
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's interesting.</v>

2127
01:36:59.141 --> 01:37:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Is that the disclaimer at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your episode,</v>

2128
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:03.880
<v Speaker 3>our episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in 100 times.</v>

2129
01:37:03.881 --> 01:37:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they got to do it.</v>

2131
01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

2132
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:09.210
<v Speaker 2>It's smart to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2133
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.660
<v Speaker 2>to me it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I see it,</v>

2134
01:37:11.661 --> 01:37:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I roll my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2135
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 2>every time I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it,</v>

2136
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2137
01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2138
01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:19.340
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying because what we're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>

2139
01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a litigious group.</v>

2140
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to shy away from many </v>

2141
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.430
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits if they could have sued us or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have,</v>

2142
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:30.470
<v Speaker 2>but they know what we're saying is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the policies of the church.</v>

2143
01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2144
01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 2>what they should do is go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2145
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:36.200
<v Speaker 2>we subscribe to these policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't fucking like it.</v>

2146
01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't be part of our church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't say we're all aligning.</v>

2147
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It's right there on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You assholes.</v>

2148
01:37:41.811 --> 01:37:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I had the books at my freaking garage.</v>

2149
01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:47.130
<v Speaker 3>What are you learning about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Owning at all?</v>

2150
01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I felt like you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2151
01:37:48.181 --> 01:37:48.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2152
01:37:48.601 --> 01:37:51.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking now your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2153
01:37:51.181 --> 01:37:53.280
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your current state right now,</v>

2154
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 3>like doing this show and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having all these people.</v>

2155
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you're helping a lot of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2156
01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2157
01:37:59.161 --> 01:38:00.960
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting their message out there.</v>

2158
01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:05.961
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very heartbreaking message when </v>

2159
01:38:05.961 --> 01:38:08.001
<v Speaker 3>you see these people and they are not in</v>
<v Speaker 3>contact with their children and they're </v>

2160
01:38:08.001 --> 01:38:08.570
<v Speaker 3>not in contact with loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an imagine</v>

2161
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.700
<v Speaker 2>daughter doing those videos going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother just wants to make a buck my.</v>

2162
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm disgusted by my mother and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed that.</v>

2163
01:38:16.831 --> 01:38:18.630
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's my mother.</v>

2164
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2165
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:22.900
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2166
01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the lucky ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2167
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:27.390
<v Speaker 2>like these things didn't happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2168
01:38:27.391 --> 01:38:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't molested,</v>

2169
01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't physically hurt.</v>

2170
01:38:32.401 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My kids didn't disconnect from me.</v>

2171
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:39.330
<v Speaker 2>My Mother didn't disconnect from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my mother during the holidays.</v>

2172
01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I have my sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my husband now.</v>

2173
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Your life must have revolved around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>church and a very big way.</v>

2174
01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 3>What is that like now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all those people they've written </v>

2176
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 3>you off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2177
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2178
01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.120
<v Speaker 2>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad for them because our </v>

2179
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.341
<v Speaker 2>relationship was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was obviously I'm dependent on my </v>

2180
01:39:02.341 --> 01:39:03.100
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the Church of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology.</v>

2181
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:06.710
<v Speaker 3>So you can understand that right from </v>
<v Speaker 3>them being brainwashed and.</v>

2182
01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they knew me.</v>

2183
01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from my church to say,</v>

2184
01:39:11.951 --> 01:39:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you're lea is an enemy of our church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend should have said bullshit,</v>

2185
01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:17.920
<v Speaker 2>but aren't you kind of an enemy of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>now though?</v>

2186
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I would be.</v>

2187
01:39:19.811 --> 01:39:21.040
<v Speaker 2>They know we're telling the truth.</v>

2188
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that truth is very damaging to their</v>

2189
01:39:23.581 --> 01:39:26.370
<v Speaker 3>organization because the organization of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the church,</v>

2190
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2191
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying anything wrong behind it.</v>

2192
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Say you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be part of it.</v>

2193
01:39:31.630 --> 01:39:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't really do that.</v>

2194
01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're doing some fucked up </v>

2195
01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:37.780
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

2196
01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.600
<v Speaker 2>they say they're the epitome of morality</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2197
01:39:38.601 --> 01:39:39.290
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2198
01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:42.500
<v Speaker 2>the elite of mankind there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saving the planet.</v>

2199
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:46.280
<v Speaker 2>So when you go on their website and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2200
01:39:46.281 --> 01:39:48.470
<v Speaker 2>they say they are the largest growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

2201
01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:50.120
<v Speaker 2>They own the only ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2202
01:39:50.121 --> 01:39:52.700
<v Speaker 2>The solution to life demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ils.</v>

2203
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2204
01:39:55.251 --> 01:39:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So when you make those kinds of claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

2205
01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:00.350
<v Speaker 3>good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then stand behind it.</v>

2206
01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

2207
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.990
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in other things.</v>

2208
01:40:02.991 --> 01:40:04.940
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think you're all lost.</v>

2209
01:40:05.210 --> 01:40:08.360
<v Speaker 3>We are extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are bigots and we.</v>

2210
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:09.830
<v Speaker 3>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are our beliefs.</v>

2211
01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Then don't join us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We obviously have enough money.</v>

2212
01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you communicate with any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people weren't allowed to talk to me.</v>

2213
01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen celebrities who talk shit to </v>

2214
01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 3>me on twitter and social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not directly at me</v>

2215
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:23.470
<v Speaker 2>and they run from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run from me at parties</v>

2216
01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 3>and they're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're lucky that they run because </v>

2217
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.890
<v Speaker 3>honestly I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind you talking shit.</v>

2218
01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Just when you see me back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

2219
01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Just back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you say,</v>

2220
01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know why I don't want to name </v>

2221
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:39.520
<v Speaker 3>a name Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2222
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:39.520
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want to give him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much</v>

2223
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.800
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give them that.</v>

2224
01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.330
<v Speaker 2>You can just name any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any celebrity that you know</v>

2225
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:46.630
<v Speaker 3>like that does a scientologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would.</v>

2226
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:47.520
<v Speaker 3>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have Kirstie.</v>

2227

2229
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Why she me a bigot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2230
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.810
<v Speaker 1>because you don't like scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2231
01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't a big hit when I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anybody else.</v>

2232
01:41:00.431 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 1>What site intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2233
01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what I was very much a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan and she knows it because she is.</v>

2234
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:12.300

2238
01:41:23.630 --> 01:41:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Like Bill Lewis was just at a wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her Juliette Lewis,</v>

2239
01:41:26.531 --> 01:41:28.450
<v Speaker 1>his brother who I grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light field.</v>

2240
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the sane,</v>

2241
01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.840
<v Speaker 1>intelligent community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was filming a wedding.</v>

2242
01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:32.780
<v Speaker 1>He was a sinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2243
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the video.</v>

2244
01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:38.940
<v Speaker 1>He literally ran from me and my husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was videoing the wedding.</v>

2245
01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:44.190
<v Speaker 1>So whatever that shot was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my husband even said to him like,</v>

2246
01:41:44.281 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2247
01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:45.460
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he ran.</v>

2249
01:41:47.171 --> 01:41:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And the other band members because </v>
<v Speaker 1>angels singing,</v>

2250
01:41:49.301 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2251
01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he okay?</v>

2252
01:41:52.511 --> 01:41:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Is He?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2253
01:41:53.561 --> 01:41:54.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a scientologist.</v>

2254
01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm ignorant as to how many celebrities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are scientologist.</v>

2255
01:42:02.331 --> 01:42:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one.</v>

2256
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2257
01:42:08.181 --> 01:42:10.100
<v Speaker 1>because he's a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2258
01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:15.150
<v Speaker 1>and he's like a uber creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that person is like </v>

2259
01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:15.200
<v Speaker 1>super open mind that he comes out with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song like,</v>

2260
01:42:15.201 --> 01:42:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you kill me that song.</v>

2261
01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.480
<v Speaker 1>So this song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser.</v>

2262
01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:24.350
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2264
01:42:25.501 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big hit for sure.</v>

2265
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:29.790
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2266
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And then this one's saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to leave him because he seemed to.</v>

2267
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Ish.</v>

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to work.</v>

2291
01:43:33.861 --> 01:43:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what I do.</v>

2292
01:43:35.451 --> 01:43:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I love acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love making people laugh,</v>

2293
01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but I don't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2294
01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>You only need one solid hint in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2295
01:43:42.381 --> 01:43:45.410
<v Speaker 1>You know that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my passion.</v>

2296
01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.440
<v Speaker 1>This is something that I always wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do as far as helping people.</v>

2297
01:43:50.601 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 1>This is why I in scientology.</v>

2298
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I loved helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was everything to me.</v>

2299
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 2>If somebody needed help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

2300
01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I just love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I know like to talk shit </v>

2301
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:07.721
<v Speaker 2>about these people I know in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearts they really believe they're </v>

2302
01:44:07.721 --> 01:44:10.901
<v Speaker 2>helping even attacking me is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really want to call these </v>

2303
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:16.571
<v Speaker 2>people out like this specific per but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least have the balls to back it </v>

2304
01:44:16.571 --> 01:44:17.840
<v Speaker 2>up when you see me.</v>

2305
01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So you believed they had just have </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided intentions but their </v>

2306
01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 1>intentions are correct as you did at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time to.</v>

2307
01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.770
<v Speaker 1>So you're uniquely qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call anybody a liar,</v>

2308
01:44:26.771 --> 01:44:31.771
<v Speaker 1>a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would tell the [inaudible] story is a </v>

2309
01:44:31.771 --> 01:44:31.771
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2310
01:44:31.771 --> 01:44:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You sound crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the story?</v>

2311
01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:37.980
<v Speaker 1>This is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how they got to be attached to </v>

2312
01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.420
<v Speaker 1>our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new story is they got package.</v>

2313
01:44:40.450 --> 01:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can google it all into a volcano </v>

2314
01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>that got dropped into a volcano or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2315
01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got packet like there was at planet</v>

2316
01:44:47.441 --> 01:44:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that existed like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like this and then the,</v>

2317
01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:55.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord Xenu thought that there was too</v>

2318
01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:59.380
<v Speaker 1>many people on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we packaged all these people up.</v>

2319
01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that Ota stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2320
01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I think this is stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steps two,</v>

2321
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what?</v>

2322
01:45:03.441 --> 01:45:05.320
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at Ota,</v>

2323
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:06.800
<v Speaker 1>your mom's out now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2324
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hold on.</v>

2325
01:45:07.511 --> 01:45:07.870
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2326
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you were told when the very beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and scientology that you have a reactive</v>

2327
01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:16.931
<v Speaker 2>mind and so in dianetics you are running</v>
<v Speaker 2>out these bad experiences that you've </v>

2328
01:45:18.291 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 2>had maybe this lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe last lifetime,</v>

2329
01:45:20.541 --> 01:45:22.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe lifetimes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

2330
01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:26.090
<v Speaker 2>you're told that you have a reactive </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and we're going to take it away.</v>

2331
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.190
<v Speaker 2>We're going to find it and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take it away.</v>

2332
01:45:28.191 --> 01:45:30.440
<v Speaker 2>So you don't even know that you have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you're told you have it.</v>

2333
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you run all these things,</v>

2334
01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 2>these incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'll get it</v>

2335
01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.470
<v Speaker 1>picture in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2336
01:45:36.471 --> 01:45:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a picture of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a French medieval times,</v>

2337
01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:41.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2338
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.460
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to believe it.</v>

2339
01:45:43.461 --> 01:45:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say what it is.</v>

2340
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was burned at the stake.</v>

2341
01:45:47.391 --> 01:45:52.391
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I obviously I was in Salem and I </v>

2342
01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:52.391
<v Speaker 1>was worried because I have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fire,</v>

2343
01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're making up these things as you</v>

2344
01:45:53.871 --> 01:45:55.700
<v Speaker 1>go and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm making these up.</v>

2345
01:45:55.701 --> 01:46:00.701
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a policy that says the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's going to say by on harbor that </v>

2346
01:46:00.701 --> 01:46:00.710
<v Speaker 1>they're making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not making it up.</v>

2347
01:46:00.711 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 1>These are real pictures of real past </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

2348
01:46:03.051 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2349
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get to Ota,</v>

2350
01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:08.980
<v Speaker 2>you're told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2351
01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.380
<v Speaker 2>so what wasn't true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that was a law.</v>

2352
01:46:12.381 --> 01:46:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is like,</v>

2353
01:46:15.761 --> 01:46:18.820
<v Speaker 2>what aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a,</v>

2354
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a</v>

2355
01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.500
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a this,</v>

2356
01:46:23.501 --> 01:46:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was never louis the.</v>

2357
01:46:25.991 --> 01:46:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I was never that guy that I said I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>never a witch in Salem.</v>

2358
01:46:30.491 --> 01:46:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I was never.</v>

2359
01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.150
<v Speaker 2>So That's what Ota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically told what?</v>

2360
01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.240
<v Speaker 2>What wasn't true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you like,</v>

2361
01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:38.740
<v Speaker 2>what are you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just me.</v>

2362
01:46:38.770 --> 01:46:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did your mom get out?</v>

2363
01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.430
<v Speaker 2>My mom got off that ship and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going back.</v>

2364
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Why is that killing another thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you thought it was bullshit,</v>

2365
01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>but thought it was okay</v>

2366
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.980
<v Speaker 1>when you were going through your ot </v>
<v Speaker 1>three thing and they're explaining to </v>

2367
01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you that you're covered with bugs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are beings.</v>

2368
01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.320
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2369
01:46:57.490 --> 01:47:02.490
<v Speaker 1>We need to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm laughing,</v>

2370
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 1>joking around a little beings that bugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>or without a body.</v>

2371
01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2372
01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your mom got all the way past that </v>

2373
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and something she decided at one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>

2374
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for me.</v>

2375
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:23.990
<v Speaker 1>What was it that she decided?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't tell me that she would have </v>

2376
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>told me that that would have stopped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>from going.</v>

2377
01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:30.710
<v Speaker 1>They would have pulled me in a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did she think it was bullshit and </v>

2378
01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.370
<v Speaker 1>she got to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't tell me.</v>

2379
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.160
<v Speaker 1>She thinks it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still coming up behind her.</v>

2380
01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.390
<v Speaker 1>If I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she then pulled me in and said,</v>

2381
01:47:39.391 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Leah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit.</v>

2382
01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would have turned her in.</v>

2383
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have.</v>

2384
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 1>They would have gone to work on me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother.</v>

2385
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:54.621
<v Speaker 1>You need to disconnect from your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want me to disconnect from </v>

2386
01:47:54.621 --> 01:47:57.870
<v Speaker 1>her is her family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you learned to be quiet.</v>

2387
01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It's so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is complicated and it takes years and</v>

2388
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:04.260
<v Speaker 1>years of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just.</v>

2389
01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:09.261
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your mom got to Ota so she had to go </v>

2390
01:48:09.261 --> 01:48:09.580
<v Speaker 1>to the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And is it the wackiest to the wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she got there and she's like,</v>

2392
01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:14.400
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

2393
01:48:14.410 --> 01:48:16.140
<v Speaker 1>We're just happy to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

2394
01:48:16.141 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like she was free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2395
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when she left?</v>

2396
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Did they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2397
01:48:21.271 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 1>where are you going after you're done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They let you off the ship,</v>

2398
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You complete it,</v>

2399
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you get a cert and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go every day anymore.</v>

2400
01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:32.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now created more ot levels now.</v>

2401
01:48:32.821 --> 01:48:37.821
<v Speaker 1>So she would have been called back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They created more like what we just went</v>

2402
01:48:38.471 --> 01:48:40.980
<v Speaker 1>into the vault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncovered a squirrel.</v>

2403
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:46.340
<v Speaker 1>We found some writings of l Ron Hubbard </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he passed and I swear to God,</v>

2404
01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a lie and you believe it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2406
01:48:51.810 --> 01:48:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for the people looking back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2408
01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.160
<v Speaker 1>good heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we believed what they were saying.</v>

2409
01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2410
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:04.390
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just found it.</v>

2411
01:49:04.391 --> 01:49:09.391
<v Speaker 1>Element Hubbard said it was the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bridge was Ota and we spent her </v>

2412
01:49:09.391 --> 01:49:13.341
<v Speaker 1>whole life doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want there to be a definite </v>

2413
01:49:13.341 --> 01:49:13.341
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2414
01:49:13.341 --> 01:49:16.670
<v Speaker 1>so I can live your life a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just incredible that a science </v>

2415
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:19.971
<v Speaker 1>fiction writer could create something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this that's so poorly written and </v>

2416
01:49:20.850 --> 01:49:22.900
<v Speaker 1>we only knew of his science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

2417
01:49:22.901 --> 01:49:25.170
<v Speaker 1>like from him telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like we were faint,</v>

2418
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.720
<v Speaker 1>new l Ron Hubbard as a science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>

2419
01:49:27.721 --> 01:49:32.721
<v Speaker 1>It must be in some knowledge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise battlefield earth would have </v>

2420
01:49:32.721 --> 01:49:32.721
<v Speaker 1>been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they have a whole building on,</v>

2421
01:49:32.721 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2422
01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:37.881
<v Speaker 1>they have a whole literary building on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood boulevard called Arthur </v>

2423
01:49:37.881 --> 01:49:41.070
<v Speaker 1>services and it's all dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elbert Hubbard's publishing.</v>

2424
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think this man is a serious,</v>

2425
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:46.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2426
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 1>this is somebody who was really.</v>

2427
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2428
01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 4>people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote more books and wrote more stuff</v>

2429
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 4>than more fiction than any human being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's ever lived ever.</v>

2430
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2431
01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.910
<v Speaker 4>He wrote more fiction than anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>has ever walked the face of the planet.</v>

2432
01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Something about his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made up,</v>

2433
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.960
<v Speaker 4>made up more shit than anyone who ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived.</v>

2434
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 4>So he wrote down more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That never really happened.</v>

2435
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Then anyone who ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the scientology stuff he was telling</v>

2436
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:16.570
<v Speaker 4>the truth about.</v>

2437
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't make that,</v>

2438
01:50:19.371 --> 01:50:20.630
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2439
01:50:20.631 --> 01:50:22.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't make that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

2440
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:27.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reading dianetics because it's </v>

2441
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>self help book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were searching for something </v>

2442
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2443
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 2>most people are looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you read that book and </v>

2444
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2445
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I could cure myself a psychosomatic ils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2446
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:40.830
<v Speaker 4>big part going clear is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2447
01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:46.320
<v Speaker 4>it seems pretty obvious that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going through some issues himself and </v>

2448
01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:46.320
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to self diagnose and self</v>

2449
01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.230
<v Speaker 2>himself of blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2450
01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.820
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you believe it.</v>

2451
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:50.930
<v Speaker 2>You want to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2452
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you want to believe like I can cure </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself of things.</v>

2453
01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I am the cause of my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2454
01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing by my own thoughts and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want this reactive mind.</v>

2455
01:51:01.551 --> 01:51:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2456
01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense,</v>

2457
01:51:03.471 --> 01:51:04.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people say,</v>

2458
01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:08.450
<v Speaker 2>have you ever done anything that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is uncontrollable to you,</v>

2459
01:51:08.451 --> 01:51:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that you know is damaging to you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2462
01:51:15.311 --> 01:51:16.490
<v Speaker 2>that's because it's your reactive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beneath you.</v>

2463
01:51:16.491 --> 01:51:16.810
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2464
01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in your subconscious.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Deep in your subconscious and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna help you find those areas and </v>

2470
01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:38.970
<v Speaker 2>being able to control your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It saved your life.</v>

2477
01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking that away from her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking away your gains and your </v>

2478
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:57.131
<v Speaker 2>wins,</v>

<v Speaker 2>know I'm telling the truth and don't </v>

<v Speaker 2>They know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a listen.</v>

2485
01:52:08.961 --> 01:52:10.430
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't know it was true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's done aware.</v>

2487

<v Speaker 2>So to come from me,</v>

2488
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:15.770
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of crazy,</v>

01:52:16.461 --> 01:52:18.920
<v Speaker 2>What is the predominant criticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst these people?</v>

2491
01:52:18.921 --> 01:52:20.450
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't say you're lying,</v>

2492
01:52:20.451 --> 01:52:21.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2493
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.890
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

2494
01:52:21.891 --> 01:52:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm lying baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just me.</v>

2495
01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>We're all lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any person who's spoken out against the </v>

2496
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.070
<v Speaker 2>church is lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are bigots.</v>

2497
01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:36.110
<v Speaker 2>We are invalidating their religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

2498
01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:41.140
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling them that something didn't </v>

2499
01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:41.140
<v Speaker 2>help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

2500
01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's said,</v>

2501
01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:46.660
<v Speaker 2>if you feel you've been helped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been held however you know the </v>

2502
01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 2>truth and now you have a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they think is,</v>

2503
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology helps me.</v>

2504
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 2>And so that's all I care about.</v>

2505
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:59.170
<v Speaker 2>So you don't give a shit about abuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't care that children were being </v>

2506
01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:00.440
<v Speaker 2>molested and these things were being </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden.</v>

2507
01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't care that were being molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honey,</v>

2508
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 2>if you even just google that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I just said,</v>

2509

<v Speaker 2>scientology and Traumas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will come upon website after website</v>

2510
01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:09.800

2511
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I was molested while I was in the church</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the church did nothing about it.</v>

2512
01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not alleging it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've read,</v>

2513

2518
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear it because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are becoming more and more vocal about </v>

2519
01:53:28.930 --> 01:53:32.381
<v Speaker 2>what's happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I seem overly passionate about</v>

2520
01:53:34.191 --> 01:53:39.191
<v Speaker 2>this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I have heard these stories </v>

2521
01:53:39.191 --> 01:53:43.330
<v Speaker 2>over and over again behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have heard stories of people being </v>

2522
01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:44.570
<v Speaker 2>abused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>children being abused mentally,</v>

2523
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:45.770
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>

2524
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:49.910
<v Speaker 2>and I'm only me with a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2525
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he can't do anything other than just</v>

2526
01:53:52.161 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 2>let me tell these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2527
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2528
01:53:54.751 --> 01:53:55.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually,</v>

2529
01:53:56.230 --> 01:53:57.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2530
01:53:57.531 --> 01:54:00.880
<v Speaker 2>and Mike Rinder and other avenues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2531
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:05.910
<v Speaker 2>we really can't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do something right by </v>

2532
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:08.981
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the last thing that I want to be </v>

2533
01:54:08.981 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 2>bothered with his bullshit from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity who knows that,</v>

2534
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:16.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're telling the truth about what we </v>

2535
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:18.311
<v Speaker 2>have already spoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be interested enough to maybe </v>

2536
01:54:18.311 --> 01:54:19.910
<v Speaker 2>find out what I am talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2537
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:24.580
<v Speaker 3>The granite one is really odd because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a newsperson.</v>

2538
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:28.370
<v Speaker 3>She's supposed to be a television news </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>

2539
01:54:28.371 --> 01:54:29.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2540
01:54:29.001 --> 01:54:29.860
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what she does?</v>

2541
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2542
01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:32.630
<v Speaker 2>But why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2543
01:54:32.631 --> 01:54:33.260
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>

2544
01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Because I would just assume like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would want your news from someone who </v>

2545
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:39.390
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe a bunch of wacky shit.</v>

2546
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that I'm in her defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2547
01:54:42.301 --> 01:54:47.301
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what I need a person believes </v>

2548
01:54:47.301 --> 01:54:47.301
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2549
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distinction that I'm glad you did </v>

2550
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:53.880
<v Speaker 2>make is when you are hearing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuses,</v>

2551
01:54:53.881 --> 01:54:57.360
<v Speaker 2>when you were hearing about things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are happening that are hurting people,</v>

2552
01:54:57.750 --> 01:55:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you then do need to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aligned with this organization.</v>

2553
01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 2>And so I do need to find out how long </v>
<v Speaker 2>has she been in it?</v>

2554
01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I think most of her life.</v>

2555
01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2556
01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:12.061
<v Speaker 3>You get indoctrinated as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you received emails or any sort of </v>

2557
01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.600
<v Speaker 3>contact from people who your show </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefited and it,</v>

2558
01:55:15.610 --> 01:55:17.260
<v Speaker 3>it was the catalyst for them leaving</v>

2559
01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:18.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2560
01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.620
<v Speaker 2>For leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2561
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've received tons of emails of people </v>

2562
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:25.800
<v Speaker 2>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you told me that.</v>

2563
01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I watched your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am well informed now.</v>

2564
01:55:28.511 --> 01:55:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I will never step into a church of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

2565
01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about people leaving because you're</v>

2566
01:55:36.281 --> 01:55:38.230
<v Speaker 2>not getting some intelligence watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>

2567
01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:40.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2568
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>they have shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2569
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:43.890
<v Speaker 2>They have to be on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2570
01:55:43.891 --> 01:55:48.891
<v Speaker 2>average scientologists do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not watching shows like </v>

2571
01:55:48.891 --> 01:55:48.891
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to pay for that.</v>

2572
01:55:48.891 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2573
01:55:49.651 --> 01:55:54.651
<v Speaker 2>like you'd have to go in the next day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pay to have your own interrogation </v>

2574
01:55:54.651 --> 01:55:55.710
<v Speaker 2>and punishment handed to you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a show like ours.</v>

2575
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.580
<v Speaker 2>We're going clear after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just go,</v>

2576
01:55:58.581 --> 01:56:03.581
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you believe that I am the </v>

2577
01:56:03.661 --> 01:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you believe that I'm a liar,</v>

2578
01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.830
<v Speaker 2>that I have crossed over to another side</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not to be listened to.</v>

2579
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Why would you support somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking shit about you and your faith or</v>

2580
01:56:15.571 --> 01:56:20.571
<v Speaker 2>your family and people you love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you out of your way to listen to </v>

2581
01:56:20.571 --> 01:56:23.301
<v Speaker 2>them maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the average person doesn't want to </v>

2582
01:56:23.301 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 2>seek out things that they think are </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaging.</v>

2583
01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:30.620
<v Speaker 4>What kind of blowback have you received </v>
<v Speaker 4>from this and what kind of blowback </v>

2584
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.821
<v Speaker 4>back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because a guy like Paul Haggis are </v>

2585
01:56:33.821 --> 01:56:33.821
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence Wright or of,</v>

2586
01:56:33.821 --> 01:56:37.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul had to watch his family go on his </v>

2587
01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.190
<v Speaker 2>website that the Church of scientology </v>
<v Speaker 2>created and watch his family talk about </v>

2588
01:56:40.190 --> 01:56:44.621
<v Speaker 2>him disconnect because they're still in </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnect from him as every single </v>

2589
01:56:45.561 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 2>person who's been on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2590
01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.030
<v Speaker 2>they've been followed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd been harassed,</v>

2591
01:56:50.031 --> 01:56:52.430
<v Speaker 2>they'd been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pi is following them.</v>

2592
01:56:52.431 --> 01:56:54.350
<v Speaker 2>They have people showing up at their </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

2593
01:56:55.190 --> 01:56:57.950
<v Speaker 2>They're getting mail of like people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2594
01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:03.520
<v Speaker 2>people who don't even have never stepped</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a church or getting mail connected </v>

2595
01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.630
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mail at their house,</v>

2596
01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:08.900
<v Speaker 2>like have never stepped into a church of</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

2597
01:57:09.010 --> 01:57:11.350
<v Speaker 2>The girl does my eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2598
01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2599
01:57:12.921 --> 01:57:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd never substitute.</v>

2600
01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:15.080
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

2601
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:18.080
<v Speaker 2>She's getting mail for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Church of Scientology.</v>

2602
01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

2603
01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:22.970
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a little anecdote but that,</v>

2604
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:27.800
<v Speaker 2>but to have your family make videos of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2605
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:31.490
<v Speaker 2>to not talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to refuse to see you,</v>

2606
01:57:31.491 --> 01:57:34.430
<v Speaker 2>you're their own grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2607
01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just something I can't deal with.</v>

2608
01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:42.700
<v Speaker 2>But also now what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm dealing with now is hearing </v>

2609
01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:46.250
<v Speaker 2>stories of these people who have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced for years,</v>

2610
01:57:46.251 --> 01:57:51.251
<v Speaker 2>the pain that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had to deal with and sustain </v>

2611
01:57:51.251 --> 01:57:53.720
<v Speaker 2>through these years effect that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal in any way is a miracle.</v>

2612
01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I hope to do something with them </v>

2613
01:57:59.440 --> 01:57:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and I hope to make some changes.</v>

2614
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:04.700
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the positive aspects of </v>

2615
01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.931
<v Speaker 4>scientology and how do you think it </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefited you and do you think it's </v>

2616
01:58:07.931 --> 01:58:11.471
<v Speaker 4>possible to take some of those positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects and either reform that </v>

2617
01:58:12.531 --> 01:58:16.850
<v Speaker 4>organization or form another </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization that doesn't try to control</v>

2618
01:58:16.851 --> 01:58:21.851
<v Speaker 4>people's thinking but maybe positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe tries to encourage the positive </v>

2619
01:58:21.981 --> 01:58:24.170
<v Speaker 4>benefits of being a part of a group,</v>

2620
01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:27.650
<v Speaker 2>promote anything good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know it's an Olin proposition,</v>

2621
01:58:27.710 --> 01:58:28.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it?</v>

2622
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:30.380
<v Speaker 4>But isn't there some,</v>

2624

<v Speaker 2>the books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2625
01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's,</v>

2626
01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2627
01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:39.540

<v Speaker 2>concepts and she's like,</v>

2628
01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in psychology.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2634
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm finding things that work for you.</v>

2635
01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that my therapist me is </v>

2636
01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.330
<v Speaker 2>that it's not just one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2637
01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:00.460
<v Speaker 2>you get something from here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get something from there.</v>

2638
01:59:00.461 --> 01:59:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It's knowledge is scientology is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about knowledges.</v>

2639
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:04.510
<v Speaker 2>It's about us</v>

2640
01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:06.840
<v Speaker 3>in this therapy thing is very new to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2641
01:59:06.841 --> 01:59:09.720
<v Speaker 3>You never went through any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first thing that I said to her is,</v>

2642
01:59:09.721 --> 01:59:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to know that I think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know more than you.</v>

2643
01:59:11.970 --> 01:59:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I was taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taught as a sign</v>

2644
01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.680
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have wasted your life going to </v>

2645
01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:18.680
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2646
01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.301
<v Speaker 2>I could do for a person and five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this emitter what you're going to do </v>

2647
01:59:23.301 --> 01:59:23.940
<v Speaker 2>with me in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2648
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:25.790
<v Speaker 2>in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2649
01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:27.990
<v Speaker 2>what did your therapist say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

2650
01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.990
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that you feel that way.</v>

2651
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.910
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2652
01:59:32.911 --> 01:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

2653
01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:38.370
<v Speaker 2>spirituality and religion should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with the ego.</v>

2654
01:59:39.170 --> 01:59:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Would like that stayed with me for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second because I was like,</v>

2655
01:59:42.210 --> 01:59:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I have a huge ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's right.</v>

2656
01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:49.460
<v Speaker 2>She's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientologists believe that they have </v>

2657
01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:52.701
<v Speaker 2>the answers and when you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have shut yourself off to a.</v>

2658
01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:56.520
<v Speaker 2>The fruits of our observation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing other people,</v>

2659
01:59:56.521 --> 01:59:59.910
<v Speaker 2>to opening your heart up to things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

2660
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It shuts you off completely.</v>

2661
02:00:02.090 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like this is a part of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're really exploring or </v>

2662
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:09.350
<v Speaker 3>exploring maybe for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Non Cologne thing is like,</v>

2663
02:00:09.351 --> 02:00:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm so judgy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm willing to maybe change my mind.</v>

2664
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 3>My Non Cologne thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen that video of Tom </v>

2665
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the where it's got the mission </v>

2666
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:23.380
<v Speaker 3>impossible sort of soundtrack playing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the background.</v>

2667
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:25.430
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you stumbled upon a car accident?</v>

2668
02:00:25.610 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Like you know that you were the one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us take care of it because you're a </v>

2669
02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:31.000
<v Speaker 3>scientologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the only one that can handle that</v>

2670
02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:32.570
<v Speaker 2>and and you believe that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>assigned,</v>

2671
02:00:32.571 --> 02:00:37.380
<v Speaker 2>told you you are not only you are taught</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are the only ones doing anything</v>

2672
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:38.910
<v Speaker 2>that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only ones,</v>

2673
02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>that's why it was so shocking to me when</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one in my church is willing to stand </v>

2674
02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2675
02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.441
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we are not those people who stand up </v>

2676
02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>right where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who look the other way </v>

2677
02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:51.330
<v Speaker 2>because you're all looking the other way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the time,</v>

2678
02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:55.470
<v Speaker 2>because of David Miscavige,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have no balls really,</v>

2679
02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.740
<v Speaker 2>are we those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the truth of the matter is when </v>

2680
02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:00.740
<v Speaker 2>there was an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2681
02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I did stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2682
02:01:01.291 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 2>That person has stopped since then.</v>

2683
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:05.390
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the positive benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology.</v>

2684
02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel that you're responsible for </v>

2685
02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:11.160
<v Speaker 3>everything and you felt like you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>help as well.</v>

2686
02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we felt he could help and you wanted to </v>

2687
02:01:15.710 --> 02:01:15.710
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a positive thing,</v>

2688
02:01:15.710 --> 02:01:15.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2689
02:01:15.710 --> 02:01:16.250
<v Speaker 3>And also intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're healthy?</v>

2690
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's gotta be some.</v>

2691
02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a lot of scientologists ego,</v>

2692
02:01:22.610 --> 02:01:25.670
<v Speaker 3>so if you think you're the only one </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing anything,</v>

2693
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:28.220
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are other people who stopped,</v>

2694
02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but I believe in my heart I believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was because I was a </v>

2695
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.990
<v Speaker 3>scientologist that I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I saw in life I was like,</v>

2696
02:01:35.991 --> 02:01:37.640
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's good people in the world.</v>

2697
02:01:37.641 --> 02:01:41.240
<v Speaker 3>They have no interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no ulterior motive,</v>

2698
02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:46.241
<v Speaker 3>no vested interest in helping somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there do like.</v>

2699
02:01:46.281 --> 02:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm more shocked like what the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why like in in the last episode,</v>

2700
02:01:50.421 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I was in tears.</v>

2701
02:01:51.110 --> 02:01:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I was a mess because I was shocked by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the goodness of people that I thought </v>

2702
02:01:56.110 --> 02:02:00.971
<v Speaker 3>the world was so screwed because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology because I thought we were </v>

2703
02:02:01.851 --> 02:02:04.940
<v Speaker 3>the only good people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>

2704
02:02:04.941 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so stupid and juvenile.</v>

2705
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:12.250
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It completely makes sense and honestly </v>

2706
02:02:12.250 --> 02:02:16.480
<v Speaker 3>from someone who's lived their entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life indoctrinated in that I ideology </v>

2707
02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:18.780
<v Speaker 3>and you've only been out for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

2708
02:02:18.970 --> 02:02:23.970
<v Speaker 3>You're showing a remarkable amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>self insight and a remarkable amount of </v>

2709
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:30.970
<v Speaker 3>ability to examine the flaws of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>past thinking and current and current.</v>

2710
02:02:32.931 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everyday I'm like,</v>

2711
02:02:34.191 --> 02:02:39.191
<v Speaker 3>that's really messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to abandon the foundation that </v>

2712
02:02:39.191 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you've kind of established your entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life on,</v>

2713
02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:44.801
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to do it in your forties after all </v>

2714
02:02:44.801 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 3>these years of being involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy sort of organization,</v>

2715
02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very admirable.</v>

2716
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:54.221
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be way easier for you to just </v>

2717
02:02:54.221 --> 02:02:54.221
<v Speaker 3>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in,</v>

2718
02:02:54.221 --> 02:02:57.050
<v Speaker 3>stay inside your comfort zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep doing all your nonsense,</v>

2719
02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:00.110
<v Speaker 3>get up to 55 or whatever the fuck it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2720
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:02.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just a key.</v>

2721
02:03:02.111 --> 02:03:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Paying the money and keep your friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2722
02:03:04.730 --> 02:03:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you miss any of your friends that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in it?</v>

2723
02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2724
02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I only miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2725
02:03:11.790 --> 02:03:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the children have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2726
02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>like my goddaughter and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I see her,</v>

2727
02:03:17.761 --> 02:03:19.970
<v Speaker 2>she lives in my neighborhood and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't talk to you.</v>

2728
02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Well her mother can't talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't know me now.</v>

2729
02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I delivered her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2730
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>deliver the hospital and then I moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We moved my friend close to me down the </v>

2731
02:03:32.431 --> 02:03:37.431
<v Speaker 2>street so she could be in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>school district and then I'd be able to </v>

2732
02:03:37.431 --> 02:03:41.361
<v Speaker 2>be my goddaughter and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see her in the neighborhood and she </v>

2733
02:03:41.361 --> 02:03:43.830
<v Speaker 2>can't talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2734
02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:44.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2735
02:03:44.851 --> 02:03:49.851
<v Speaker 2>that my car door doesn't know me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't know to come to me because </v>

2736
02:03:49.851 --> 02:03:51.270
<v Speaker 2>she's now only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2737
02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:51.930
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

2738
02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2739
02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:57.600
<v Speaker 2>how were they hanging on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>

2740
02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.300
<v Speaker 2>how do they stand a mess?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000,000</v>

2741
02:04:00.301 --> 02:04:02.130
<v Speaker 2>in assets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three billion.</v>

2742
02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it takes,</v>

2743
02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.580
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna take a few good men and women</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand up with us and,</v>

2744
02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:11.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get interested.</v>

2745
02:04:11.070 --> 02:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2746
02:04:12.061 --> 02:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>there's been a few public figures to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to publicly come out.</v>

2747
02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You're now one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan is another one.</v>

2748
02:04:18.271 --> 02:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2749
02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some people with some balls</v>

2750
02:04:21.841 --> 02:04:24.030
<v Speaker 2>that are willing to say this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

2751
02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:29.100
<v Speaker 2>We should be doing something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world at large is supportive of,</v>

2752
02:04:29.370 --> 02:04:32.160
<v Speaker 2>of me and the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to the show.</v>

2753
02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Amazingly supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social media has been amazing to us,</v>

2754
02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:37.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2755
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:42.470
<v Speaker 2>and as well and eat very brave to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show like this at first time of it's </v>

2756
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:43.740
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a series about it.</v>

2757
02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took some bowls and their part,</v>

2758
02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they pussied out with disclaimers but </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2759
02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably had to do that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to defend them.</v>

2760
02:04:56.210 --> 02:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think more and more people are </v>

2761
02:05:01.210 --> 02:05:01.300
<v Speaker 2>coming out and more and more people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being supportive,</v>

2762
02:05:01.301 --> 02:05:04.750
<v Speaker 2>but we need more people in the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye to say this isn't enough.</v>

2763
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:05.440
<v Speaker 2>We need to do something.</v>

2764
02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:08.620
<v Speaker 3>What has it been like doing press for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and promoting it?</v>

2765
02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Like what have been the varied reactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>from people that you've talked to?</v>

2766
02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been varied.</v>

2767
02:05:14.191 --> 02:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It's been very supportive and beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Touched by it.</v>

2768
02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know what I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

2769
02:05:21.130 --> 02:05:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if I was going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were gonna,</v>

2770
02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of walk the line and go,</v>

2771
02:05:26.711 --> 02:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2772
02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:32.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one problem I had was with them </v>

2773
02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:32.940
<v Speaker 2>because I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2774
02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Dan knew enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan was provided with enough.</v>

2775
02:05:34.571 --> 02:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>We've talked to him enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Harris,</v>

2776
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from 20 years isn't like cut out.</v>

2777
02:05:41.111 --> 02:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't be impartial about things.</v>

2778
02:05:43.091 --> 02:05:44.830
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be impartial about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2779
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>There's things in the world you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up to.</v>

2780
02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want people to feel that power,</v>

2781
02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:55.200
<v Speaker 2>whether it's this cold or other cults or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a political party or agenda.</v>

2782
02:05:57.011 --> 02:05:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel people have the power to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2783
02:05:59.171 --> 02:06:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that's becoming more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident and I think people need to start</v>

2784
02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:05.320
<v Speaker 2>standing up for what they believe in.</v>

2785
02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:07.960
<v Speaker 2>They can do something and we get asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the time.</v>

2786
02:06:07.961 --> 02:06:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

2787
02:06:08.981 --> 02:06:11.020
<v Speaker 2>call your congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them and say,</v>

2788
02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I want you to look into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do something about this.</v>

2789
02:06:14.291 --> 02:06:15.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're a lawyer who could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2790
02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you should contact us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're somebody who has a knowledge </v>

2791
02:06:22.301 --> 02:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>of something that that could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could help us prosecute you need to come</v>

2792
02:06:25.841 --> 02:06:30.841
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of the stories that we </v>

2793
02:06:30.841 --> 02:06:33.841
<v Speaker 2>told the statute of limitations on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuses have already passed and it's </v>

2794
02:06:33.851 --> 02:06:35.610
<v Speaker 2>their words against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2795
02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:37.150
<v Speaker 2>a hundred others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say,</v>

2796
02:06:37.151 --> 02:06:40.660

<v Speaker 2>we walked in right now to that base that</v>

2797
02:06:40.661 --> 02:06:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them wouldn't leave.</v>

2798
02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what's going on out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2799
02:06:47.561 --> 02:06:52.561
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that what's they're </v>

2800
02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:53.440
<v Speaker 2>being told is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2801
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:56.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2802
02:06:56.321 --> 02:07:01.321
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to walk into those gates with </v>

2803
02:07:01.321 --> 02:07:01.321
<v Speaker 2>the FBI and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

2807
02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably,</v>

2808
02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:10.090
<v Speaker 2>they won't go with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stand there and say,</v>

2809
02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I beat you,</v>

2811
02:07:13.091 --> 02:07:14.480

<v Speaker 2>He beat,</v>

2812
02:07:14.481 --> 02:07:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were saying,</v>

2813
02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2814
02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:21.200

<v Speaker 2>he had to rub some people up and he </v>

2815
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>admits it in the show.</v>

2816
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:21.820
<v Speaker 3>But not you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't beat anybody.</v>

2817
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:24.760
<v Speaker 3>You have to smack anybody around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in general,</v>

2818
02:07:24.761 --> 02:07:29.761
<v Speaker 3>because I did shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been into a few fights and </v>

2819
02:07:29.761 --> 02:07:29.761
<v Speaker 3>clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been in fights in clubs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2827
02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>bad attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did they ever make you smack anybody</v>

2828
02:07:53.741 --> 02:07:54.880

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2829
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not about snacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about.</v>

2830
02:07:56.771 --> 02:07:57.910
<v Speaker 1>But he had to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2831
02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:02.940
<v Speaker 1>He had a beat people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige and this is what they </v>

2832
02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:03.730
<v Speaker 1>have said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said it under oath.</v>

2833
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm David miscavige under his direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

2834
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

2835
02:08:09.490 --> 02:08:11.140
<v Speaker 1>and they had admitted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2836
02:08:11.290 --> 02:08:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but were they admitted it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be 20 people who said they're </v>

2837
02:08:16.290 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like a punishment thing,</v>

2838
02:08:18.101 --> 02:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>whether they're flogging these people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

2839
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 1>they had a policy called overboarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the ship was,</v>

2840
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the sea org and they went </v>

2841
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:28.920
<v Speaker 1>overboard.</v>

2842
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who was out of lunch throw them</v>
<v Speaker 1>overboard.</v>

2843
02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you tossed them in the water,</v>

2844
02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you don't have overboarding </v>

2845
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2846
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:39.910
<v Speaker 1>But when you say them the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pull them back out or fuck you.</v>

2847
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they throw him a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know.</v>

2848
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got back on the boat but it was a </v>

2849
02:08:48.930 --> 02:08:50.611
<v Speaker 1>form of punishment and now they've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilated that to be like,</v>

2850
02:08:51.101 --> 02:08:56.101
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a boat so it might as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack him in the mouth or break his </v>

2851
02:08:56.101 --> 02:08:56.101
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a boat anymore?</v>

2852
02:08:56.101 --> 02:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they had the free winds but they </v>

2853
02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>don't have a seaward ship like they used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2854
02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Now they have bases,</v>

2857
02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>factor like what happened to the boat?</v>

2858
02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Why are you obsessed with the boat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like would be a cool thing to </v>

2859
02:09:13.770 --> 02:09:15.160
<v Speaker 1>own on the old cytology boat going </v>

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:41.300
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's purposeful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know what it's about.</v>

2896
02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You appear as if your intentions are </v>

2897
02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:57.641
<v Speaker 2>pure so that you then have maybe favors </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this happening where somebody files</v>

2898
02:10:57.681 --> 02:11:00.170
<v Speaker 2>a police report and you get screwed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

2899
02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think this is going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you,</v>

2900
02:11:06.411 --> 02:11:09.980
<v Speaker 2>where do you anticipate your ballet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a battle.</v>

2901
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I hope that we kind of do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2902
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.340
<v Speaker 2>no because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2903
02:11:16.341 --> 02:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>if you received the calls that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>receive,</v>

2904
02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:22.570
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm not working on the show because</v>

2905
02:11:22.571 --> 02:11:24.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an executive producer of the show so</v>

2906
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:29.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not safe to just call anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm going to call and it's my,</v>

2907
02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>me and Mike.</v>

2908
02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:35.420
<v Speaker 2>It's were the ones who have to vet these</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and kind of a,</v>

2909
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:40.660
<v Speaker 2>people trust us because they know we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth and they know that we </v>

2910
02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:43.250
<v Speaker 2>have their best interest at heart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the story correctly.</v>

2911
02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:49.490
<v Speaker 2>And when you talked to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to them behind the scenes,</v>

2912
02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 2>it takes every piece of me not to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2913
02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I have to be kind of a their auditor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2914
02:11:56.721 --> 02:11:59.300
<v Speaker 2>There's scientology auditor to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit together.</v>

2915
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.960
<v Speaker 2>But when I hang up on devastated by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm devastated by it.</v>

2916
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2917
02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I've been part of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2918
02:12:05.330 --> 02:12:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm getting teary eyed talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about now many people are in it,</v>

2919
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:11.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide.</v>

2920
02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Well it gives the appearance because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought like at these big events to the </v>

2921
02:12:19.191 --> 02:12:20.780
<v Speaker 2>shrine auditorium that they have every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2922
02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:21.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2923
02:12:21.110 --> 02:12:26.110
<v Speaker 2>They show what scientology is doing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they use things like hundreds of </v>

2924
02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.910
<v Speaker 2>millions and these really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrifying statistics.</v>

2925
02:12:28.911 --> 02:12:33.911
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we bought this building when we </v>

2926
02:12:33.911 --> 02:12:34.820
<v Speaker 2>bought that building and that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate growth.</v>

2927
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the subliminal message to you.</v>

2928
02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people in there,</v>

2929
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:43.580
<v Speaker 2>but there are just buildings and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you believe that those buildings are</v>

2930
02:12:43.581 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they have to do for tax purposes.</v>

2931
02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the appearance that it's growing,</v>

2932
02:12:50.090 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have to get offload some of </v>

2933
02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:55.490
<v Speaker 2>this money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an endgame with all this?</v>

2934
02:12:55.550 --> 02:13:00.550
<v Speaker 2>My end game is just to tell these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's stories to validate that their </v>

2935
02:13:01.281 --> 02:13:06.281
<v Speaker 2>pain is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to let the church bully </v>

2936
02:13:06.281 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>them or scientology bully them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>believing that they made it up,</v>

2937
02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.320
<v Speaker 2>that they're out to get money or fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't make money doing this show.</v>

2938
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying how long are you doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like,</v>

2939
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2940
02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>

2941
02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:23.590
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've only done eight and then two </v>

2942
02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:23.590
<v Speaker 2>specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2943
02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:23.590
<v Speaker 2>like some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2944
02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the reddit specials that we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2945
02:13:27.381 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stories to be told.</v>

2946
02:13:32.071 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even scratch the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how many stores are we going to tell?</v>

2947
02:13:36.271 --> 02:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's my end game?</v>

2948
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>My end game is that these stories get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

2949
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.080
<v Speaker 2>that people get incensed enough where </v>
<v Speaker 2>this church,</v>

2950
02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>well I have to call him your church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This organization is held responsible </v>

2951
02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:51.360
<v Speaker 2>for the things that they have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2952
02:13:51.361 --> 02:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>they stop destroying families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2953
02:13:53.550 --> 02:13:55.690
<v Speaker 2>there's so many tiers to it that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

2954
02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it ends,</v>

2955
02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:01.350
<v Speaker 3>but somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no plan as far as I know</v>

2956
02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.470
<v Speaker 2>going to stop hurting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2957
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:06.780
<v Speaker 2>You're going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take some responsibility</v>

2958
02:14:06.781 --> 02:14:09.510
<v Speaker 2>for what you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These stories are real.</v>

2959
02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.600
<v Speaker 2>These are not liars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't say they were hurt and </v>

2960
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:17.691
<v Speaker 2>molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't go on television for fame to </v>

2961
02:14:17.691 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get money from doing that.</v>

2962
02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't get money from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2963
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:22.160
<v Speaker 2>who wants to go on television and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2964
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I was coerced into getting an abortion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2965
02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who,</v>

2966
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does that for fame?</v>

2967
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2968
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I was hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was abused.</v>

2969
02:14:30.271 --> 02:14:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I was sexually molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I allowed this to happen.</v>

2970
02:14:32.970 --> 02:14:35.490
<v Speaker 2>These things are not easy for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>admit to.</v>

2971
02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2972
02:14:37.141 --> 02:14:39.270

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2973

<v Speaker 2>I believed in this my whole life that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother believed in it her whole life,</v>

2974
02:14:43.381 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 2>that my stuff we gave our life to this </v>
