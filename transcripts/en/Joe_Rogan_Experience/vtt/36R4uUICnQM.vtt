1
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.300
Did Joe Rogan Association podcast is brought the association.

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
I was thinking my brain is crossing signals right now cause I was thinking of a

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.600
radical feminist associations and it got a got brought up.

4
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.310
Sometimes I'm talking about something and if I'm done,

5
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.950
I've done it too many times.
Like the introduction to the podcast,

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.540
I go on full on autopilot so I don't really know what the fuck is coming out of

7
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.510
my mouth until it comes out.
And then my brain goes,
wait,
what?

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600
So I went on full auto pilot there.
I fucked it up.

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.800
The chew real can podcast is brought to,

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
this episode is actually brought to you by a guest sponsor,

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
which is audible.com and if you've ever gone audible.com if you're read the

12
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.720
audio books,
it's the shit.
It's a really amazing website.

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.050
If you go to audible.com forward slash Joe,
they uh,

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.060
I don't know.
What do they do?
They hook you up with something,
download a free.

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
Okay,
you can try it free for 30 days.
That's what it is.
And believe me,

16
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.720
if you're a person who commutes especially,
I think one of the things,

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.600
one of the reasons why I was really into doing this is I think a lot of the

18
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.410
people that listen to this podcast listen to it while they're commuting or you

19
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.110
listened to it when you're at the gym where you listen to it when you're on a

20
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.130
plane and what I consider places where you're stuck somewhere or you would like

21
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.820
something to entertain you.
And uh,
it's a very,
it's kind of a new,

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.470
really an uncaptured form of entertainment.
I mean,

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.480
for the longest time all we had was like radio and cds in the cars,
but with,

24
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:37.920
with podcasts and audio books,
man,
sometimes I don't want to park.

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.890
If I got a bad ass audio book on and I'm really into it,

26
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.480
I don't want to fucking park my car.

27
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.250
I would shut my phone off and I'll listen to a good story.
And um,

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
uh,
so audible,
if you try it free for 30 days,

29
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:51.240
I guarantee you're going to like it.

30
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:55.740
They have a tremendous selection of fiction and nonfiction and the one that I'm

31
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.360
going to recommend they wanted me to recommend.

32
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.810
One is the war of art by a guy named Steven Pressfield.
And uh,

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
it's a fucking amazing book that really changed my life and made me really

34
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.941
understand like the roadblocks to being creative and what,

35
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.550
what people do sort of set themselves up for failure.

36
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.120
They create little traps and problems in their creative life.

37
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.600
And this book really outlines that better than anything I've ever written.

38
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.600
And uh,
it's just,
uh,

39
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.800
to me like one of the most inspirational books that I've ever,
uh,

40
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.920
that I've ever read.
I haven't listened to the audio version of it,

41
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.020
but I'm sure it's good.
All,
all the audible ones are the shit.
It's a,

42
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:33.630
it's a really great website.
So check it out.

43
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.180
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you go to [inaudible] dot

44
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.470
com now you'll see that we have hemp force protein powder in which is fucking

45
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.950
sensational.
Does not make you fart in nearly as much as whey protein.

46
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.600
It's really easy to digest.
It's got Maca and raw cocoa in it,
and the MCCA is,

47
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.800
is good for your endocrine system.
It's supposed to make your dick hard,

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.190
allegedly.
It's never worked for me.

49
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.710
I've never eaten Mac and bill fuck bitches.

50
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.540
But that's one of the things it's supposed to do.

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.030
It's supposed to increase your libido.
Uh,

52
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.110
and that raw cocoa is actually a very strong antioxidant and it's sweetened with

53
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.200
Stevia.
So it only has one gram of sugar per serving.

54
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.070
So it's very low sugar and it tastes fucking fantastic and it's really good for

55
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.070
you.
It's called hemp force protein powder and a,

56
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.050
we also have kettle bells and battle ropes in,

57
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.900
along with all the nootropics that we push every week,
like Alpha brain,

58
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.420
which I take before every podcast.
That's why I talk so much bit.

59
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.560
So what do you mix with this?

60
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.350
This hemp stuff just makes it with ice or do you mix it with almond milk?

61
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.940
I'll use coconut water and a banana.
That's what I use.
And it's easy.

62
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:37.060
And the vitamin test?
Yeah,
it's so easy to digest.

63
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.020
It's like [inaudible] like there's,
I don't feel like I even ate something.

64
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.050
Like I'm not hungry,
but I don't feel like I need something.
It's super easy.

65
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.890
Whereas I love like muscle milk and there's a bunch of like protein powders.

66
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.490
It tastes awesome.
They like taste like,
like treats like dessert.

67
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.160
But the shit just makes you fart like crazy.

68
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.220
It's all that way and sugar and your body's like,
why are you doing?
Oh,

69
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260
okay.
This is a good way to go about it in a bad way to go about it.
And,
uh,

70
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.990
the hemp is the best way for me.
Plus he get marijuana street cred.

71
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.650
You know what I'm talking about?
What'd you get these muscles from?

72
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.820
Some looking at them shifts from weed bits.
Um,

73
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.890
and if you were interested in nootropics,

74
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.170
I s I suggest that you Google the word nootropic and find out what the fuck I

75
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:21.480
means.

76
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.760
Because if you're taking advice from a comedian that used to be the fear factor

77
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.210
host on anything I suggest you look deeper.
Uh,

78
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.980
nootropics are just vitamins.

79
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.660
They're vitamins that have been shown to have a positive positive effect on

80
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.150
cognitive function.
Uh,

81
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.820
essentially it helps your brain produce more neurotransmitters.

82
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.870
It's like the building blocks of nutrition that your brain needs to function at

83
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.200
an optimal level.
And a,
there's a lot of controversy behind the subject,

84
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:48.970
but I've been a fan of nootropics for years.

85
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:52.600
I've been taking it for years and I absolutely feel a difference when I take him

86
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:53.320
and when I don't,

87
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.290
as well as I feel the difference between when I eat really healthy,
when I don't,

88
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.640
when I have like Kale shakes for breakfast in the morning and eat clean food and

89
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:01.690
make sure I drink a lot of water,

90
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.660
I feel different than when I just got off a plane and I've been eating shitty

91
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.500
food.
It's,
it's,
it's a real obvious take care of your body,

92
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.670
get optimum results.

93
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.770
You could be swole like me and Everlast get yourself some kettlebells,
bitch,

94
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.080
if you're interested in the kettle bells and we got them on sale.

95
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.360
All different sizes,
all different packages,
battle ropes as well.
Um,

96
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.510
what a battle ropes son,
you got to learn.

97
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.820
You've got to learn about the battle ropes,
crazy ropes.

98
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.790
You throw around like Conan the barbarian and get one of them.

99
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.990
Impressive physiques.

100
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.200
All of it is available at [inaudible] dot com so go check it out.

101
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.750
O n n I t and use a code name Brogan.

102
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.950
You will save 10% off any and all supplements.
And uh,

103
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.870
we also have a 100% money back guarantee on the supplement,

104
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:43.390
especially for the first order of,

105
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.480
or essentially only for the first order of 30 pills.
We let you try it.
And uh,

106
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.020
if you don't agree,
you know,
you don't think that it's worth it,

107
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:53.050
then you don't even have to send it back in to get your money back.

108
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.200
And I think that's important because I don't want anybody to feel ripped off.

109
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.260
I think the most important thing in selling anything is the most important thing

110
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.340
is that you have to sell something of value and people have to appreciate it,

111
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.380
enjoy it.
And if you're not doing that,
if you're squeezing money out of people,

112
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.490
I don't want to be involved.

113
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.690
There's nothing that we sell that isn't something that I use and enjoy and that

114
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.520
I would recommend even if they didn't give me a nickel.

115
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.260
Just like a recommended CTO,
coconut water.
Cause it's this shit.
All right.

116
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.600
That's it.
Cue The music.
Everlast is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

117
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.273
We're going to get deep.

118
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.410
We're going to break it down for ourselves and for others.

119
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.910
[inaudible]
of America.

120
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.463
That squire.

121
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.720
Yeah.
We were talking about a feminism feminists that are angry.

122
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.880
It's such a Cliche,
you know,
the angry feminist cliche is a funny one.
You know,

123
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
like every man,
every man shakes his head.
It goes,
oh Jesus.
Not One of those,

124
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.280
you know,
it's a strange,
a strange designation roof on Twitter for you dog.

125
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.180
No,
we need to be Uber Fans.
Yeah,
but they need to relax.

126
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.070
We need to be humans.
You know,
I think people completely misunderstood.

127
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.870
We had a podcast the other day and you know,
it got,
I got a little shoddy.
Uh,

128
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:16.010
it was a,
it's a very important issue for me about the,

129
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.420
the idea of censorship and you know,
for me,
I know,

130
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.750
you know the whole story happened.
Yeah.
You know the toss story.

131
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:24.740
So for people didn't know the Taj Story.

132
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:28.430
Tosh he said something to a woman in the crowd,
you know,

133
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.690
it was just responding to like,

134
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.490
he's fucking around with the crowd and said something like,

135
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:35.080
wouldn't it be fun if she got raped by five people?
What it was it,

136
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.140
someone said you should joke about rape.
He goes on a rant about how rape,

137
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:39.590
well yeah,

138
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.650
what's funny about rape and like all the things that aren't funny about rape.

139
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.710
And she goes,
actually rape has never funny.
So he goes,

140
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:49.670
wouldn't it be funny if five guys raped her?
It's funny.
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.540
It's unfortunate and it's,
you'll like this is not the best kind of comedy.

142
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.700
You know,
the best kind of comedy is there's no victims.

143
00:07:55.701 --> 00:08:00.230
Everybody gets out clean rape jokes 15 minutes or raped.

144
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.560
You look rape.
Isn't that funny dude?
It's,

145
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:05.810
it's just occasionally it's the right thing to say.

146
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.890
It's if it's like you have to look at comedy as an equation,
what's,

147
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:14.030
what's the 10 move there?
I'll tell you what the 10 move is.
The 10 move is,

148
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.030
wouldn't it be funny if somebody raped her?
It's the,
it's the,
the,
the Kale part.

149
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.400
Ha.
I'm a musician and I feel like you got to own your stage.

150
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.200
A comedian has to do it in a whole different way.
Like literally a comedian if,

151
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.540
if they,
if you're synced week,
I mean it's coming at you from all that.

152
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.500
So if you don't make that joke,
if you don't show it,
I,
okay,
here it is.

153
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.760
Here's why I really don't want to do it.
Fine.
Here it is.
You know,

154
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.470
the question of whether he had to write to or not as a stupid question.

155
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.490
Of course he did.

156
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.360
It's in that it's in the environment of standup comedy and somehow or another,

157
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.870
this is,
everybody has gotten so God damn over sensitive.

158
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:56.190
It wasn't till like half of the jokes in bore rat rape jokes.
Yeah,
I'm sure.

159
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.800
Right.
It also has its dude's getting raped.
Nobody cares.

160
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.290
<v 1>Dudes can get raped all that.
Yeah,
you could say,</v>

161
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm going to rape you to any guy.
Right.

162
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.090
<v 0>It's pretty much nothing.
I mean it sucks if it happens,</v>

163
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.050
but you gave me permission but it is not the same and it,

164
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:11.790
and we don't approach it the same so we don't understand that the same.

165
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.590
So I think what they're asking for,

166
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.940
if I understand the other side statement is that they,
they,

167
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.820
they want a higher degree of sensitivity from people.

168
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.930
And I say that they're not related because it's not about being sensitive.

169
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.440
It's about someone saying something absolutely preposterous for humor.

170
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.340
It's not about being sensitive in that in that environment and the environment

171
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:34.380
stand up.
Comedy Dad's an art form.

172
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.350
The only way to do it correctly is you got to go balls out.

173
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.630
And what he did is he went balls out.
He said,

174
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.180
wouldn't it be funny if you know why it's connect?

175
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.610
Kind of like the whole point of like that whole aristocrats joke like is like

176
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.980
that who can be the craziest,
stupidest,

177
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.100
outrageous like ridiculous dumb thing.

178
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.790
Who can go there that jokes a style of comedy.
I mean the,

179
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.370
the idea of that joke did that,
that really complete Raunchy,

180
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.910
like we had dice clay on the podcast yesterday that,
that over the top,

181
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.890
that's like a legitimate art form.

182
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.080
And for what if just because you don't like it,

183
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.640
it doesn't mean you should get so fucking shitty about other people practicing

184
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:12.390
that our farm and in when you step in and start saying things like,

185
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:16.950
a guy shouldn't have said this certain thing to one certain person in the heat

186
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.950
of a moment.
I think that's craziness.
You know?

187
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.800
I think that that's just straight fucking nonsense.

188
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:26.850
So all these people getting upset at me and then they get the wrong impression.

189
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.230
I'm for everybody being equal.
I am.
I'm a humanist.

190
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.290
I don't like women more than I like men and I don't like men more than I like

191
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:35.940
women.
I like nice people.

192
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.090
<v 1>I like women and better than I like men.
Just for the record.
Do you?
Yeah,</v>

193
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.530
<v 0>there's a lot of them that are really pretty.
Look,</v>

194
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.430
what I'm trying to say is we should all,
we should be humanists.

195
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.730
We should this idea of masculinist.
That's fucking nonsense.

196
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.970
You imagine if I started putting it on my Twitter profile that I was a radical

197
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:54.790
masculinist pitches would start attacking me.

198
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.400
They would think it'd be fine to start attacking me.
They would just go,

199
00:10:57.401 --> 00:10:59.930
what do you have?
A small penis?
I'm sorry about your penis not working.

200
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.820
Whatever it is.
If five fucking something you,
your insecurities,

201
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.060
your fucking problems with your father.
I'm not here to deal with you.

202
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.100
They would find some reason to be mad at you.

203
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.420
<v 1>Joe.
If he had to live with one person for the rest of your life,</v>

204
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.240
everyone else died except a female or a male,
who would it be?

205
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.810
Which one would it be?
A bit,
dude.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry mom.

206
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.810
I don't know man.
The person in the whole world,

207
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.140
you have to fucking be with one other person for the rest of your life.

208
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.690
No other people in the whole entire road.

209
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.990
Just a woman or a man and this is either you know George Clooney or the top of

210
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.090
the line female like,

211
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.550
<v 0>well usually it doesn't matter the top of the line.
Female,</v>

212
00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:38.850
the what's matters is her personality.
Right?
For you.

213
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:40.740
If you're going to deal with a lifelong proposition,

214
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.310
the most important thing is that she's an easy going person you can actually get

215
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:48.320
along with.
So that would be the ideal move is someone who would,
you know,

216
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.860
be down for fucking
Joe.
You're supposed to say your wife.

217
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.660
You supposed to say that,
but that's,
that's obvious.

218
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.720
I think you would have to,
um,

219
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.080
you would have to really decide how much sex do you wanted for the rest of your

220
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:04.690
life.
Yeah.
I think that's pretty important.
So it's really all about,

221
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:08.140
you only have one person.
We don't feel like I'm going to love your wife,
my wife.

222
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.910
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
But it's so obvious,
so obvious.

223
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:17.110
He can't say it like one of those,
well,
I love my wife,
my wife.

224
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.940
The best one is,
uh,
uh,
what's his face?
Um,

225
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.770
Groucho Marx had a talk show you,
I think it was,
you bet your life.
Uh,

226
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.180
and,
uh,
a guy came on and,
uh,
it's worrying if I'm Bob.
And the guy's like,

227
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:33.820
you know,
Cincinnati,
you have kids.
And he's like,

228
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.900
I've got six kids and the Groucho Marx,
Marx spelled wow.
When he goes,
well,

229
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:39.880
I love my wife grabbed,
she goes,
I love my cigar,

230
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:43.750
but I take it out of my mouth every now and then for back then.

231
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.370
That was like,
no one could believe what he said.
They were like,

232
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.330
what the fuck?
What did you just say?
You went crazy.

233
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.850
You went crazy.
I don't show.

234
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.500
He was a to show where the bird with the secret word.

235
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.760
Groucho was such a bad motherfucker.
He was.
That dude was ahead of his time.

236
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.020
That dude was way ahead of his time.
Dude's did not get Groucho Marx.

237
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:11.320
He had to tone it down for those fools taped down as much.
That

238
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.600
kind of weird.
It was that.
Yeah,
Groucho Marx with it.
Shit.

239
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.940
He was a fucking smart dude,
man.

240
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.440
The idea that the idea that the way that you know,
I think,

241
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.170
not joking about anything,
it's silly.

242
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.470
The idea that you could tell a comedian that he can't joke about anything,

243
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.820
especially when you absolutely know that they didn't mean that they absolutely

244
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:36.340
don't mean that someone should get raped.

245
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.270
That's not what they intent is supposed to be.
What language is conveying.

246
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.580
It's all supposed to be what is going on in my mind.

247
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.210
You're pretending that you don't understand the subtleties of the conversation.

248
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:50.890
You're playing stupid so that you can get angry and I think that is fucking

249
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:52.810
maddening.
That shit drives me nuts.

250
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.890
They know no one really wants anybody to get raped,
so you're playing stupid.

251
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.210
You're pretending that it really does mean that and it's contributing to a whole

252
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:05.680
culture of people believing that.
Dammit,
bitches settled the fuck

253
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.730
<v 1>down.
Calm down.
Dan.
Dan,
who's Dan,</v>

254
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.350
this guy has said that was going to rape at the beginning of the Pi

255
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.470
three why is that so?

256
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.300
You didn't see pointing Joe at the beginning of the podcast.
I have it.

257
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.430
When I was on audible,
this was thing came up in this chat room.
It's like,
hi,

258
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:26.650
I'm Dan from audible here to help you.

259
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:30.940
And I start texting him and I'm sorry for what?
I said,
what did you say to him?

260
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.670
I said I was going to rape them.
Did you really say that?
Yeah.

261
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.260
Did you do that while we're doing the park test?
I feel bad cause right it.

262
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.990
When I did,
I was like,
man,
I'm too stone.
It was a really bad idea.
So Dan,

263
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:41.860
I did not mean it.

264
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.730
<v 0>Yeah.
What if Dan's listening man,
and he's like,
that guy's an asshole.</v>

265
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.710
Just made me feel uncomfortable.

266
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.250
<v 1>And then we've got to really dumb argument whether know rape is a more</v>

267
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 2>worse than murder.
What's worse?
Rape or murder.
The whole thing was so stupid.</v>

268
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.190
What do you think?
Where's rape or murder?

269
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.150
<v 3>Would you rather get raped or murdered?
They'll fuck outta here.
It's such,</v>

270
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:04.980
just stupid.
Who would win if you're raping me,

271
00:15:04.981 --> 00:15:06.970
I better already have been murdered.

272
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.600
<v 2>Yeah,
no shit.
Right.
Saved to rape until after I'd been murdered.</v>

273
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.040
Die Eventually.
Maybe this is how we go.

274
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.910
I was raped actually just the other day,
man.
I had my recent physical.
Oh,

275
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.620
sucks.
What was it?
A ball or an ass.
It's horrible.

276
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.860
Isn't it weird that they have to do have to dig in your body.

277
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.130
See what you got to go in and check your prostate.
Let's see how it the fuck.

278
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.580
See How freaky you live in which you get like,

279
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:42.420
I think it's 60 my dad said that when he turns 60 you have to get a tube in your

280
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:45.840
penis hole.
Oh,
check your penis hole.
Okay.

281
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.720
Remind me to check out before I'm 60 well,

282
00:15:48.721 --> 00:15:51.600
I think they want to check to see if it's all swollen.
A fucked up in there.

283
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:54.360
That's why I like a lot of dudes have to go to the bathroom every 15 minutes.

284
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.710
Yeah,
that shit ain't good.
Can't be fun.
It can be fun.

285
00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:01.980
They say that you you have to beat off though.
You could avoid a lot of that.

286
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.940
A lot of dudes just quit beating off.
They just tap out these people.

287
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.470
Who are these people not beating by the way,

288
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.690
that is not a scientific diagnosis.

289
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.680
People who like I hate when he spelled pseudo science.

290
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.690
I'm not saying that that's a fact,
but that is what I read on the Internet.

291
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.980
I'm sure that was written.
It was in a sentence.

292
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.500
I absorbed it and I said all right,
there you go.

293
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.580
They believe that one way does stop prostate problems as masturbation,

294
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.030
enlargement of the prostate.
Now you go.
So dudes will beat off a lot.

295
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:37.800
They don't have that problem with holding in their pee.

296
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.480
So if you see a guy peeing all the time it keeps getting up cause he's doing

297
00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:44.470
coke man.
Come on.

298
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.390
Either put the sneaky pouch away or go go jerk one off.

299
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:54.330
You know
the slinky pouch man,

300
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.160
kind of sneak off to sneaky pouch.
Is that a flashlight?

301
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.590
He called him like a sneaky little pouch and cocaine.

302
00:17:01.591 --> 00:17:05.970
You can go sneaky pouch and you take the homeys and you go to the bathroom and

303
00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:08.220
you know it comes back a little lighter than it went in.

304
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.930
Now you have your own sneaky pouch in a weird thing when you,

305
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.470
you ever been at a party and you know this one dude who just has just enough

306
00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:19.530
coke for himself.
So he's trying to sneak off and do it,

307
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:21.380
but he doesn't want anybody knowing and everybody's like,

308
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.530
he's this motherfucker on coke.
Like what's going on here?
They don't let it.

309
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.290
Joey Diaz gets so fucking mad if he finds out that you did like,

310
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.750
like he uh,
he uh,
I think it wa,
I don't want to say his name,

311
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.410
but someone that someone did it to him at his apartment and he was trying to

312
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.830
pretend he wasn't doing calculus.
Go in and my fucking bathroom,

313
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.620
you'd coming out all geeked out.
You're not offering me none.

314
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.250
It's a weird thing when people want to sneak off and do drug in quiet.

315
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.090
<v 4>Yeah.
That's what I know is bad news.
Yeah.</v>

316
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.470
Luckily I always had a little bit of that heart issue too,

317
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:58.320
so I never really got deep into evolved into any of it.

318
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.280
I never fucked a few times when I was really young and then it was like,
oh,

319
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.420
I got a problem.
Okay.

320
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.650
I'm probably be a good idea to stay away from coke and meth.
It seems like

321
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.930
everybody that that gets into it though really enjoys the shit out of it.

322
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.371
You know what I mean?

323
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.880
It must be doing something really wild while it's happening because they can't

324
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:22.110
wait to do it again.
Yeah.
Fucking terrible for you though.

325
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.300
I have never forget this.
I was on the,

326
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.810
on the highway headed back from Kelly's roast beef.

327
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.920
I know I've told this story before,

328
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:32.160
but I'm gonna tell it again and this is what I remember of cocaine.

329
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.460
There was a car that was right next to us.
The Dome light was on,

330
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.060
and then some people moving around in the backseat and as we're driving up to

331
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:43.380
them,
I look over and it's a girl doing coke and she looks at me and she goes,

332
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.600
and that to me in my mind was coke.
It was coke.
That's funny.

333
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:55.020
Like some girl is like screaming,
fuck you.

334
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:58.800
It's sticking her finger at me and I'm in the other car.
I didn't say a word.

335
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:03.090
I didn't,
I didn't respond.
I just,
I just looked at her and went,
wow,

336
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.350
fuck that drug

337
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.220
<v 1>man.
Last time I did coke,
it was maybe seven years ago.</v>

338
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:13.630
And the good part about coke is that it's just women love it.

339
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.560
And so like I said to her like one girl,
like,
oh,
I got some coke,

340
00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:21.120
you want to go to the bathroom and do it.
But we were at this party and uh,

341
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.700
she brought like seven of the hottest girls and we just pretty much sat in the

342
00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:25.930
bathroom.
Uh,

343
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.140
these girls just like fucking like going to the bathroom in front of me and
just,

344
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.080
and just do what we're doing.
Cope with like these seven girls.
And it was just,

345
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:33.250
they all started blowing you.

346
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.900
Would that be the guy would have been the good part of it?
Yeah.

347
00:19:34.901 --> 00:19:36.540
That would have been a good part of the story.

348
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.000
Then would you be sad that you did coke and then you couldn't get it up?
No.

349
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.910
I like,
I've never had prompt the only,
you know what I said this the other day,

350
00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:45.550
I never had a problem with ever getting a boner on any kind of drug.
I,

351
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.740
that's a lie.
Actually.
The,

352
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:51.370
the one time I couldn't do it was on ecstasy at the peak of ecstasy.

353
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.230
And do you have like a really small penis to just fires up and he at any moment

354
00:19:56.231 --> 00:19:58.680
because just take a lot to load it.
Oh,
is that what it is?

355
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.390
It just takes one tear drop

356
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.673
instantly.

357
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.360
<v 4>Remember those old John Holmes movies were home.
He couldn't get it up.</v>

358
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.740
Now remember that most of the John Holmes movies who he's always dealing with

359
00:20:14.741 --> 00:20:18.190
like a half rubber snake because his dick was huge.

360
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.340
It took a lot to get his dick hard.
And those cats were all on coke.

361
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.310
Like if you talked to the people like the,
there were a,
you know,

362
00:20:24.311 --> 00:20:26.880
doing torn back in the day,
how's calls,

363
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.530
guys were all gacked out of their mind and they're trying to fuck on camera.

364
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.710
You know?
And it's,
if you watch like the old porn,

365
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.220
like I did a David tell has a show.
Dave's old man,
I've seen him.

366
00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.900
And if you sit there and watch the old porn a lot of times too,

367
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.460
it had hard on problems that dude's like it would have all these hot chicks

368
00:20:42.461 --> 00:20:43.031
blowing him,

369
00:20:43.031 --> 00:20:46.840
sucking on his Dick and there was nothing happening like this must be for that

370
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.300
guy.
The most frustrating video,

371
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.340
like how to imagine if there was all this video of you or someone's just

372
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:54.940
sucking,

373
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.800
you're completely limp Dick on camera with his hot three Hutchinson's lights and

374
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:04.750
cameras and guys who stand there and you just can't get up.
Fuck,
fuck,

375
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.200
fuck.

376
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.910
<v 1>Yeah.
I couldn't do it in front of all those people.</v>

377
00:21:07.911 --> 00:21:10.520
I think that would be the worst part and having just like the camera guys and

378
00:21:10.521 --> 00:21:12.680
stuff,
you have to be a sociopath maybe.
Yeah.

379
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.410
<v 4>Oh yeah.
That'd be rough.
Yeah.</v>

380
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.690
I don't know if I can deal with it.

381
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.320
I thought one of the most fascinating chapters in porn was when Tara Patrick

382
00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:25.650
married that dude from the bay.
What band was that?

383
00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.480
It was in bio hazard or something like that,

384
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.420
and then the dude started doing porn with her.
I was like,
wow,

385
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.870
that's kind of a shit in that mood.
Are you in this book?
Oh,

386
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.040
what are you at all?
She just talks about me.
Did you have,

387
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.530
well,
it's not,
let's not go to all TMC.
No,
read the book.

388
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.610
It's a great book actually.
I said,
yeah,
I read it.
It's really good.

389
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:53.010
It's interesting.
You really read a book.
Really Fuck Outta here.

390
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.900
That's the book you read.
Walk Outta here.

391
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.740
That's why I can't remember every last penny in get the fuck

392
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.590
it was right before that.
Your White,
who you're talking about,

393
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.760
huge cock went right into.

394
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.410
Do you think that you could ever do that?
You couldn't do that.

395
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.140
What do you think you could do that what that dude did?

396
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.550
I'm just started doing porn with her.
No,
she is so ridiculously hot though.
Oh,

397
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.473
she is really?

398
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.680
She knew what she was [inaudible] video of mine and we met and you know

399
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.510
I would see her after midnight.
A bunch.
Wow.

400
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.690
And that was about it.
I bet.
That's awesome.

401
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.350
<v 1>She looks hotter now that she's had a baby.</v>

402
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:40.270
I think like her body is insane now because she's got like just more curves or

403
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:44.650
something.
She's just amazing.
She's hot.
She's hot as fuck.
Yeah.
Thumbs up,

404
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.940
<v 4>son of a bitch.
You son of a B a long time ago.
Hey,
whatever.</v>

405
00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:54.180
She's a nice person.
I met her,
she's a very cool,
uh,
but anyway,

406
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:57.200
this dude just looked down and started doing porn where they're like,

407
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.950
that's kind of a nutty move,
man.
You know?
Hey,
watch my fuck my wife.

408
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.000
There's something creepy about that.
Right?
Yeah.
Well the story in the book is,

409
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.500
I was kind of fucking around with that broad.
Uh Huh.
You know,

410
00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:15.170
I guess she took it more serious than I did.
My wife read the book.
Oh No.

411
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.420
She was like,
everything you said is what she said.
Right.

412
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.500
Well that's good.
Basically.
I mean it was like,
you know,

413
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:28.260
booty call bakey situation,
but I guess on her end it was not,
you know,

414
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:33.240
I was more than that or something.
So special dude,
man,
I'm,
you know,
whatever.
But,

415
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:33.660
uh,

416
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.920
like I get a call on a Sunday morning and it's Dude Evan who I'd known for years

417
00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:42.060
before that and like woke me up to like declare his love for her and I was like

418
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.130
wow,
whatever,
whatever.
I hung up the phone and I him back because he woke

419
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.620
<v 6>me up.
I was like,
it's Sunday morning,
eight o'clock.</v>

420
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.640
Cause like you just call me and like to clear love for like this for your point

421
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.760
girlfriend right now.
I was like,
that's,
it's Corny as hell.
Dot.

422
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.450
It's in the book.
My wife,
my wife read it.

423
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:02.900
She told me everything I said is in there.
It's cool.
It is housing.

424
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:07.370
That's pretty fun.
Corny dude.
Funny.
That is pretty corny man.

425
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.630
That was the end of that.
You would want to do that if like dude was your friend,

426
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.750
you know and yeah,
it was Sunday morning.

427
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:19.340
I was more mad about you fucking woke me up on a Sunday morning.

428
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.350
Come on.
Yeah,
when you fuck on camera.
Isn't it funny,

429
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.710
like automatically you become like,
if that's your choice,

430
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.990
automatically you become like you never,

431
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.710
it's like a caste system in society that's like,
that's a fuck up.

432
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:37.250
You never really get over.
He always used to be a porn queen,
you know?

433
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.910
Oh my a new one.
My wife was a nude model but she not too big.
Neverbounce yeah,

434
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.410
she never did no triple X.
Yeah.
It's once people watch it,
fuck,

435
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.900
you can see your body.
That's all well and no problems,
man.

436
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.720
I got no problem with it.
It's people watching people fuck is strange and I,

437
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.760
I've always tried to figure out why.
It's real weird.

438
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.780
My thing would be mostly how you going to,
I couldn't wife,
nobody that like my,

439
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.200
if I had a son with and 16 years later when God knows,

440
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.210
you know how available all that shit is going to be.

441
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.150
It's so easy now to find porn.
Oh Hey,

442
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.570
your kid shows up to you at 12 or whatever.

443
00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:15.580
Like why are all my friends pointing at me or showing me pictures of my mom so I

444
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:19.040
can dig.
I mean that'd be just too,
I couldn't handle that.
Yeah.

445
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:23.510
That would be hard to deal with for sure.
But my,
my real question is,

446
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:28.100
it's really why are we so weird about our bodies and sex once the thing that

447
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:30.560
most people are looking forward to the most,

448
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.880
at least most dudes are looking forward to more than anything.

449
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:37.460
Most of the motivation that of of most men,

450
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.360
it's tried to get the most amount of pussy possible or the best blood.

451
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:43.610
See or the best wife,
the best girlfriend.

452
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.110
They want to be a bad motherfucker in order to do well with that.
That's a,

453
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.940
that's a weird desire when you really stop and think about it,
how much it,

454
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.860
it consumes and then you get to be around 40 and you start thinking about other

455
00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:59.960
shit,
you know?
Yeah.
But what's crazy is they,

456
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.840
it's like unless you got married at like 20 or something,

457
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:05.540
those are the people that I'm really freak out when that's why everything's

458
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:07.010
falling apart in the middle.
Then your life,

459
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:09.840
you have too many questions that are run answered.
Yeah.
They didn't.

460
00:26:09.841 --> 00:26:12.980
So their oats enough.
I mean,
you know,
there's what I call,
I answered,

461
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.960
I'd say 99.9% any questions I had on those levels,

462
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:19.030
I answered.
Oh,

463
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.090
but my question is why is it so weird to watch people fuck if everybody wants to

464
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:26.580
fuck?
Why is it so weird?
It's so like,
oh,

465
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.560
it's way weirder here than it is anywhere else in the world.
It's totally,

466
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:34.100
that's all our hangups that we'd been hammered in that the whole like a golden

467
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:37.970
age of the fifties and the modern family and all that been hammered into our

468
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:42.950
brains and and like,
you know,
sex is dirty and rotten,
not rotten,

469
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.490
dirty and nasty and should be conducted behind closed doors and not talked about

470
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.670
at all.
And only for fornication.
Yeah.
No,

471
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.860
only to exactly children's that old school man,
you know,

472
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.800
we still come from the generation now.
I believe that really believed that.

473
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.130
<v 0>Yeah,
they,
well,
when they first landed here,</v>

474
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:02.640
I guess that's what fucked the whole thing up is how many religious freaks made

475
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:05.700
the journey because they were being religiously persecuted in England,

476
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.570
which England is not nearly as religion as religious.

477
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:13.080
On the whole as America is.
So when the puritans came here,

478
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.290
I guess a lot of that shit stuck.

479
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.510
<v 6>Puritans was the name because they were hardcore on let up.
I try not soak.</v>

480
00:27:22.511 --> 00:27:25.270
So Carl living a puritanical lifestyle.

481
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.370
<v 0>Does that make sense?
So that's why in 2012 were still hung up.</v>

482
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.730
Is it really because of that,
that it was formed by those people?
No,

483
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:33.720
but then all this,
you know,

484
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.740
I'm sure there's been many people that have reinforced the psychology for their

485
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:41.070
own benefits and you know,
yeah.

486
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.870
I wonder with all these cell phones now,

487
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.000
by the time kids get to be like babies of today and get to be grown women and

488
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:51.750
grown men,
we're going to have like where there's kind of everybody,

489
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.930
you're probably going to be able to access people's memories.

490
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.870
You're probably going to be able to walk,

491
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.520
watch porn in some sort of a fucking three dimensional virtual reality wear

492
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.050
goggles you put on and you,
you,
you live the scene.

493
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.860
People are going to make their own and you're going to,

494
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.300
we're going to be able to find people fucking,
we're going to have real problems.

495
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:13.500
This is going to be no privacy.
Yeah,
it's getting there and when that comes,

496
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.600
<v 6>I mean I,
I,
you know,
I got my little Mac laptop.</v>

497
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.050
I keep a sticker over the camera dog.
Whether I'm using it.
Do you?
Yeah,

498
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.790
I ain't fucking around man.
I believe that Yo,

499
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.970
somebody could turn that motherfucker and just start watching you.

500
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.340
You be off,
especially the cell phones and the microphone on your phone.
I bet.

501
00:28:34.341 --> 00:28:36.430
I'm sure there's somebody could just sit there and like turn on camera.

502
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.930
Turn on microphone.
What's going on right now?
That's great.

503
00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.150
You haven't done it yet.
I probably going to do it.
Yeah,
probably.

504
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.530
We just got a lot of me beaten off.
It's like you got good luck with that creep.

505
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.420
You want to release that.
You creeper

506
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.120
<v 0>were so strange because we were close.
You know,</v>

507
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.840
I think we would have a totally different attitude if we were naked all the
time.

508
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.310
Let's try it out.
Come on guys.
What?
It's just a weird thing of we've,

509
00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:04.560
we've evolved.
We,
when,

510
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:09.340
what kind of a fucking animal evolves to the point where you could barely exist

511
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.120
in the world without being covered by something barely.

512
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.560
If you just walk around naked everywhere,
dude,
you're gonna get fucked up,
right?

513
00:29:17.561 --> 00:29:20.020
You're not going to make it through that.
You're going to get sunburned.

514
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.270
Your skin is weak as shit.
You're going to get bit by things.

515
00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:26.920
You'd get all infected and fucked up.
It tears easy.
My bleed to death.

516
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.630
We have to work with that

517
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.800
<v 6>survival show recently where they had like the two guys that were survivalists,</v>

518
00:29:32.801 --> 00:29:34.480
but they were kind of opposite spectrum.

519
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:38.500
Dude's like one was a total fucking hippie dude.
One was like a Marine Guy.
Yeah.

520
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.140
Duels never wore shoes.

521
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 4>You only wore shorts and a tank top and that's how he,
you know,
he did his thing.</v>

522
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:47.500
It was like,
you know,

523
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.530
I mean I think you could adapt readapt back to being able to live like that,

524
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:56.680
but it wouldn't be no instantaneous and it would suck.
It would suck.

525
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.460
It would suck hard.
There's no fun and looking for bugs.

526
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.440
Eat while you're walking barefoot and then Sean and your feet will start hurting

527
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.390
quick man,
because shoes are nice.

528
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.480
It is nice that they would know how to survive if the shit hit the fan.

529
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.550
But if the shit hit the fan,
what are the odds that you live in?

530
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.880
What are the odds of you live in?
If the shit really hits the fan,

531
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.090
I mean you talking about extinction events,
you talking about the,
the,

532
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.890
the real potential events,

533
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.710
things that have happened unquestionably documented all throughout history where

534
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
they're found supervolcanoes and all sorts of fucking meteor impacts.

535
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.050
And then there's all these records of them there.
They're discovering just now,

536
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:33.550
like 12,000 years ago,

537
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.930
they know there was a huge meteor shower that hit the world because there's

538
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:42.280
impact glass exists on the same,
uh,
the same strata,

539
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.450
like when they dig and make core samples exists in the same area all throughout

540
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:51.130
the world.
About 12,000 years ago,
something they got fucked up 12,000 years ago,

541
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.070
right.
Giant fucking asteroids coming through the sky.

542
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.180
Millions of people dead probably.
I think when,
if that kind of shit happens,

543
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:59.440
you're lucky if you get whacked.

544
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.650
That's what I think you want to be running around eating people's dogs and you

545
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.040
want to be running around trying to purify peoples.

546
00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:08.770
So Souad trip on the fact that it wouldn't even take something that crazy.

547
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:13.020
Just let,
I keep telling people,
let the lights go out like that.

548
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.270
The power just shut down.
Yeah,
absolutely.
We're last time I was here,

549
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:18.790
I think it happened.
I was like,
that might be it,
man.

550
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:20.750
I might have to make a run for the guns right now.

551
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.820
I have a whole joke about how little we knew about the power,

552
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:28.930
but how much we need it.
I mean it's so important.
We don't,

553
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.040
no one even thinks about the fact there's essentially I would force of nature

554
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:36.250
that pulses through your fucking house all day.
Oh yeah.

555
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.360
I was in New York City when that big east coast blackout happened.
Man,

556
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.620
that was like crazy like tension because you know the whole city thought it was

557
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.550
something,
you know,
the next wave of whatever was coming at him.

558
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.960
Jesus cause you don't get no news,
you don't get me.

559
00:31:50.961 --> 00:31:54.490
And then I walked around New York.
I remember just because we knew,

560
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:57.580
I remember what happened,
I plugged something in my hotel room,

561
00:31:57.581 --> 00:32:00.160
something plugged in and wall,
few seconds later the power went out.
I was like,

562
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:02.140
oh,
did I overload my room or something?

563
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:04.260
And then I go out in the hall and it's out.
Go downstairs.

564
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.300
I realize the whole freaking cities that we went to times square just to look at

565
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:11.590
everything.
That was how it was crazy man.
Wow.
And then crazy.

566
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:15.010
And then work let out.
And like the streets were just flooded with people.

567
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:17.770
But the crazy,
the funniest thing to me was like instantly,

568
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.580
like dudes were like outside of their little bodega selling bottles of water for

569
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:25.420
like three times what they cost.
Like,
oh wow.
Hey,
$7 for a bottle.

570
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.920
The AVR and here,
you know like this man type.
Oh yeah man,
it was crazy.
You know?

571
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:31.180
And then there's the other half of you.

572
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.150
Then you walk up the street and you see like the dude who's just directing

573
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:39.140
traffic because nobody else is right.
It was crazy man.
It was a wild day.

574
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.351
Yeah.

575
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:42.410
Some dude's look forward to shit like that so they can stay in the street and

576
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:43.640
just tell cars where to go.

577
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.190
That's cool that people didn't go crazy though because that would be my fear

578
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:49.820
that everyone would just be like,
ah Nah.
I was a pretty,
you know of an la move,

579
00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.570
you know.
It was a pretty,
I mean there was tension like what?
What happened?

580
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.210
What's going on?
Everybody was asking what happened,
what's going on?

581
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.880
Every once in a while somebody's cell phone would work,
but he like,

582
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:00.660
I remember thinking like that was the day I was like,

583
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.710
you know also has happened is the lights go out.
Yeah,
I was at,

584
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:06.530
they were sounding and then you'd walk down the street to the Deli that starts

585
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:11.120
selling the food for like almost half off because it's spoiling stuff is in the

586
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:14.960
fridge.
Like anything in the fridge.
Come on and take it please.
You know?
Wow.

587
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.870
But yet charging seven bucks for water.
You know what I mean?

588
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:23.900
The whole idea of cities is a people's mentalities would break down quick,
Joe.

589
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:28.070
Oh yeah.
It would get tribal.
It'll get lord of the flies real quick,
real quick.

590
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.790
The only way cities work as if there's power on,
cause if,
if not,

591
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.480
then it becomes a detriment then becomes way too many people and no resources.

592
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.840
You know,
when you're in the country at least you can go fishing.
You know,

593
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.270
you're in a city where are you gonna get your food and what the fuck?

594
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.750
Where's the food man?
They ain't no food coming in and it's instant.

595
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:49.310
It goes away because really it needs to be like pushed in constantly.

596
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.780
We've got this weird crazy ant hill sort of a situation going on and we need a

597
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:57.440
man to fill that motherfucker up with something we can digest to keep moving

598
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.300
cities or strange.
It's so if you were an alien,
and then what about when it,

599
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.590
nobody's picking up the trash every day.
Yeah,
it's true.

600
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.480
So you got both angles going on at the same time.
Pretty soon.
It's nuts.
Insane.

601
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.750
I was there and I'm in Harlem.
When they had a,
uh,
there was some sort of a,

602
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.590
a strike with the garbage men,
so they didn't pick up for a long time dude.

603
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:25.090
And there was,
and I'm not bullshitting,
seven,
eight,

604
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.160
nine foot high stacks and garbage bags on the street.

605
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.220
So you would have a narrow area to walk and to the left would be nine foot high

606
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:35.540
garbage for like a fucking half a block.

607
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.650
It was saying that we're everywhere.

608
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.000
Big Fat,
juicy rats running everywhere and you're like,
whoa,

609
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:47.630
people are living around this.
Like this is insane.
Right underneath.

610
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.720
That's all going on.
Pulsing underneath.
It's that whole time.

611
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.410
Has that ever happened on the upper east side or the upper west side of the ever

612
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:57.500
had like a garbage strike?
I've never been heard of seventies or something.

613
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:02.180
There was a citywide one that was pretty famous.
Is that one is I think so.

614
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.310
I don't know when you know this was,

615
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.860
I dunno what was causing them to not pick up the garbage.

616
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:09.830
I don't know what it was,
but it was somewhere in the 1990s,
the early nineties.

617
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:13.310
Like maybe 90 or 91.
I vaguely remember something about it,

618
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.660
but it was crazy.
I couldn't,
I couldn't believe it.
I was like,

619
00:35:16.661 --> 00:35:20.180
what the fuck you mean you would want to get out of here as quick as possible if

620
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:24.440
some shit went down.
Like this is the worst place to be.
It's crazy man.

621
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.400
Why the fuck did it get like that where everybody's stacked on top of each
other?

622
00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:33.500
It's just keep going straight down.
You know,
if you listened to the,
the,
the,

623
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:38.130
you know,
the internets and uh,
the whole Illuminati is and all that.
I mean

624
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.780
<v 6>there were all in the perfect area for him to just wipe us all out cause we all</v>

625
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.420
live in,
it's like nobody lives in the country anymore.

626
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.180
Have a rich people go to the country day.

627
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.880
I've never understood how the rich people go to the country Hampton's day.

628
00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.610
I've never understood the whole,
uh,
rich people want to white people out thing.

629
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.010
I've always felt like if you were a rich person,

630
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:04.620
you would need people to buy your stuff.
Whatever you're selling,

631
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.710
whatever you need,
people for recess.
You,
what are you doing?

632
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.960
You're going to kill people that seems sit like,

633
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:12.490
where are you going to make your money?
That doesn't seem to make any sense.
Yeah.

634
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.290
That seemed like a good Illumina.
I also saw a stat recently that was like,

635
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.741
you know,

636
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:21.741
how would they say the world's overcrowded and whatnot are overpopulated and I

637
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.611
could be Trevon,

638
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:26.430
but I'm pretty sure I saw a stat somewhere to said all the people in the world

639
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:29.730
would fit in the state of Texas.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

640
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.760
Like with like some like elbow,
elbow room.
Like,
you know,

641
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:34.860
we'd all be able to stand in the state of Texas,

642
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.980
like all the people on the planet right now.
I don't know how crazy that is,

643
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:39.210
but I know I saw it somewhere.
Well,

644
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:41.810
if you look at us and compare it to any other animal where,
uh,

645
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.670
we've populated really every single part of the world,

646
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.730
we figured out a way to not just get there now,
but just get America though.

647
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:51.420
It's like really like last coast Cosa gang of he will east coast,

648
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:54.840
a whole gang of people and in the middle,
you know,
come on.
We do.

649
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:58.110
We toured for $11.
We know,
I mean there's,
I'm not saying there's not people,

650
00:36:58.111 --> 00:37:01.680
but um,
but it's much more relaxed and it's a whole different kind of life.

651
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.770
It's like I've always found it like going five years backwards.
Right,
right,

652
00:37:06.771 --> 00:37:09.540
right.
Like when you step out of the east or west coast,
just,
you know,

653
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:11.830
not in a disrespectful way.
I'm just saying it's like they're,

654
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.840
they're not as anxious and quick to be on the site.
No,
we like,

655
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.020
we like what's going on.
We'll slowly make moves on the things we like,

656
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:19.860
kind of thing.
What?

657
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:24.360
Denver is one of my favorite cities because Denver is like part city and park

658
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:26.340
country.
It's part like mountain people.

659
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.350
It's like a big community of mountain people.

660
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.160
So all the amount of people that got halfway and said,
you know what,
this,

661
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.190
this is,
this is good enough.
We're good.

662
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.460
We got some [inaudible] this is good.
Right?
He just killed an elk.

663
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.940
I worked good.
Let's wait here.
Why don't you guys walk around.

664
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.430
Do you see how many elk are out here in front of Ocean?
This is a good man.

665
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.880
I don't even see an ocean.
Yeah,
I'm,
I'm a big fan of the ocean.

666
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:50.220
I love looking at it,
but it can't fuck with the mountains,

667
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:51.970
the mountains or some crazy shit you're taking.

668
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.710
You're taking mountains before ocean all day sun.

669
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.300
I'm all day.

670
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:01.200
If you ever been to Evergreen Colorado mountains with a lake

671
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:06.000
own Twitter lake time,
like in the last few years,

672
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:07.770
I played a couple of festivals in Switzerland.

673
00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:11.310
One called the Montreux Jazz Festival is pretty famous and then this other one

674
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:13.230
called the blue balls festivals.
Hilarious.

675
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.330
But it's in a place called Lucerne and,

676
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.110
and they're both on lakes would just would mount as the crazy.

677
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.830
I could live there easily.
Every time I'm there I'm like,
Yo,
I need some,

678
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.090
I need to be balling out of control with a private jet and some of them Swiss

679
00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:31.350
francs,
man,
I need to be over in Switzerland doing it.
The problem is,
man,

680
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:33.900
to make that kind of money.
Unless you're an entertainer,

681
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.310
you're someone's Kevin over.
Unless

682
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.640
<v 4>you're an entertainer where you're selling something remarkable.
Cool.</v>

683
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.010
Everybody hiding their money too.
Yeah.
That's why it's they keep it pretty.
Yeah.

684
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.640
Hi Denton that came in.
I don't want to come in there and fuck around.

685
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.920
<v 1>Joe,
your old place.</v>

686
00:38:46.921 --> 00:38:49.710
Remember when I used to say that it looked like a trapper keeper.

687
00:38:49.711 --> 00:38:50.610
You remember those,
uh,

688
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.150
those things you would have in school that you put your notebooks in uni?

689
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:55.411
They would have like boys,

690
00:38:55.411 --> 00:38:59.490
like a beautiful picture of like a mountain in a scenic w you know,

691
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:04.530
Lake and stuff like that.
That's what like,
yeah,
it was ridiculous.

692
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.810
It's unbelievably beautiful.
You'd look out the back window and you'd go,

693
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.320
I can't believe they let me stay here.
Like,
this is crazy.

694
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.500
I can't believe people allowed to be here.
It was just too silly.

695
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.260
You're in the mountains,
like literally in the mountains,

696
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.441
<v 4>but you're,</v>

697
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:21.670
you're around there with everything you see in porcupines every day and deer all

698
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.680
day,
all day.
She was getting air back here up in the hill.
Really?
Oh,

699
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.530
you can get all of the all day.
Yeah.
Pasadena has bears,
man.

700
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.810
They had bears jumping into people's swimming pools recently.

701
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.040
I always like to live somewhere that's cause we were talking about craziness
man.

702
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.190
I liked to live places that have resources like other than like,

703
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:42.520
okay well if things went really bad I can walk right out my back yard marked

704
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:46.420
down that mountain and go find me a dear.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know.

705
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.260
Well I've always said Ted Nugent is live in the best,
you know what he does?

706
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:53.800
He is a high fence place where he has like thousands of acres and they're all

707
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:57.460
fenced in and these kids essentially got wild game running around his whole

708
00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:00.670
fucking giant ranch and he just sets up stands.

709
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:04.140
He's got like feeders so they know where the animals are going to come late and

710
00:40:04.141 --> 00:40:05.920
it's essentially shooting fish in a bucket.

711
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.490
And he asked to shoot a certain amount of them just to manage it because it's

712
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:12.100
got a certain amount of land.
Like you have to monitor how many,

713
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.070
how many sheep you have,
how many deer you have.

714
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.720
But that is way healthier and way smarter than going to a fucking supermarket.

715
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.630
I mean,
you know,
it's to see the animal before he shoots it.

716
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.840
He does all the butchering himself.
He makes the cuts of meat.

717
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.500
He grows his vegetables like this dude doesn't need shit.

718
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.530
Like that's really the way to go.
I mean,
he's got guns,

719
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.490
he's got guns and he doesn't need shit.
He can eat from his yard,
run out.

720
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:40.540
He got bows and arrows.
He uses the bows in the house more than he uses the guns.

721
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.130
He's always bow hunting,
man.
The nude.
Yeah,

722
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.750
he's a crazy fuck when it comes to war.
But I'll tell you why.

723
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:49.690
When it comes to like living your life sustainably,

724
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.540
that motherfucker's got it nailed when it comes to his,

725
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.410
he's right about hunting like you.

726
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.300
People are crazy to think that hunting is bad because you either want one of two

727
00:40:58.301 --> 00:40:59.230
things you want,

728
00:40:59.231 --> 00:41:02.410
either want hunting or you want to be hunted because that's the only way you

729
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:04.930
keep the deer population down.
You have one of two options.

730
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.440
Either you're going to hunt the deer or you're going to put mountain lions out

731
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:11.720
there that eat deer and anything you need steer can eat you motherfucker.

732
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.050
Oh yeah.
And he you a lot easier than once in a while.

733
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:15.670
You hear about it back here like,
oh,

734
00:41:15.671 --> 00:41:20.671
there was like people that don't want on to medium size dog getting snatched out

735
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:22.840
of my backyard by a mountain lion.

736
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.120
<v 1>Yeah,
I got those Pasadena bearers.
Yeah.</v>

737
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.330
<v 4>Oh,
the folks at home,
these are not.
These are the gay bear.
Oh,</v>

738
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.070
that's a for gay dudes

739
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.640
<v 2>were Harry.
You fuck each other?
Burt crushers everywhere.</v>

740
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.030
There's that is the Google search.
It's really borrowed.
A few did.
Roids right.

741
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.000
I got a hairy Bert.
Well,
you're pretty fucking Harry to minister.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

742
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:49.160
You'd make a good bear if you got on the sauce.

743
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.540
I started doing some heavy squats.
Yeah,
he'd be a,
you would be a good bear.
Wow.

744
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.810
I wouldn't be so bear and her cubs were drinking out of some

745
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:01.790
<v 4>ladies pool on that.
On the news.
Crazy.
Huh?
Which this is,</v>

746
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:06.140
you know,
Pasadena is only an hour,
not even an hour,
an hour from arrowhead.

747
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.620
Arrowhead is,
you know,
it's right down.
It was like 40 minutes away,

748
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:14.480
45 minutes away,
which is legit wilderness.
I mean that is yours.

749
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:18.530
Pasadena Altadena,
which is obviously the hills above Pasadena.

750
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:22.100
And then beyond that it's just wild mountains.
Wild mountains.
Yeah.

751
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.240
And then there's,
you know,
two miles from,
from here.

752
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.810
You're in the woods.
Yeah,
yeah,
it's true.
Yeah.

753
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:33.890
This is a different sort of area.
Pasadena is and the rest of La,

754
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.730
they say that what Pasadena was was in the 20s and you know,

755
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.620
they're making movies and shit like a resort town out there.

756
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.630
There was a railroad that went up to out the Gina and like all these rich folks

757
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:46.970
had their little that kind of like sorta like Hampton,

758
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.870
like kind of thing going on up there.
What is the atmosphere like now?

759
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:51.920
Cause Pasadena,

760
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.000
I know like Pasadena has more crime now that I think it's ever had before.

761
00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.920
I have to dean like the Beverly Hills of Pasadena.
All.

762
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.160
The crazy thing is there's always a lot of movies getting shot because none of

763
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:05.180
the houses are the same.

764
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:09.230
They're like Spanish style next to a colonial style next so they can like make

765
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.820
it look like anywhere in America.

766
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:16.270
So it's all like older like houses from like people that made him like who who,

767
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.860
how did they get melt out here?

768
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.710
Because what they were telling me was the Pasadena was where the studio

769
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:26.060
producers and people would live with the actors.
We live in the Hollywood hills.

770
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.760
Right.
That's something out to Dina is what I'm talking about.

771
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:32.420
And like in the twenties I believe it was like Kinda that 20s and 30s it was

772
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:35.570
like a little resort area where you could see some of those houses that are for

773
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:39.410
sale online and Alta Dena and they've got some like really old houses.

774
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.440
Turn of the century houses.
Yeah.
It's crazy shit man.

775
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.480
That's a good area man.
Yeah,
I love that.
They,

776
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.490
I like animals and deer and what's it Altadena where the lady had the mountain

777
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:57.030
lions sitting in their front driveway and she was taking pictures of it.

778
00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:02.060
It might've been out,
I think it was,
yeah,
it was a really recently.

779
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.660
If it wasn't Altadena it was real close to that with some ladies are fucking

780
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:09.200
driveway and there's a mountain lion just lying there just chilling.
Yeah.

781
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.540
I think I saw that just enjoying himself.

782
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.450
Just Chelan I've been gone most of the summer though.

783
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.830
Do you ever think about living anywhere else?
Like any other part of the country?

784
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.820
I like Nashville.
Nashville's great.
I like Nashville is like,
and you leave,

785
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.330
you dropped 10 minutes anywhere outside of like downtown and you're in the

786
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:31.620
country.
Yeah,
you're in the country.

787
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.060
<v 6>You can go out your back door and shoot no shoot stuff.</v>

788
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.380
Yeah you can shoot your guns and you know like I went and sat with this one cat

789
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:43.130
and was playing guitar with him one night again because he had a little dog,

790
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.230
you know,
that little something for me to,
you know,

791
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.260
partake of.
So we playing guitar together and he was like,
we can go outside,

792
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.190
shoot some guns.
Cause like,
yeah,

793
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.910
the guy that he was renting a place and told me it was for sale and I was like,

794
00:44:56.911 --> 00:45:00.620
you know how it was like 25 acres and like you know,

795
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:05.250
house and all this three two barns and how much,
he was like,
oh like six.

796
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:09.360
And I was like in my brain was like 6 million.
Like yeah,
wow,
6 million.

797
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:11.710
I was like,
man,
that's a pretty good price.
He was like,
Nah man,

798
00:45:11.711 --> 00:45:15.870
I'm like six 600,000 I was like,
are you shitting me?

799
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.110
I was like,
Yo man,
I might have to,
I might have to do that one day.

800
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:24.150
Just get out of extras.
Grabbed me,
grabbed me,
grab a ranch.
Yeah man.

801
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.160
You know what else is great?
Asheville,
North Carolina.
You have been up there?

802
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.890
I have,
I don't know if I've been particularly there.

803
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:33.480
I've been to North Carolina many times.

804
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:34.950
<v 0>I've only looked at it online,</v>

805
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:39.951
but apparently it's like this like really cool spot in the mountains where it's

806
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.710
small population,
lot of stoners,

807
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.560
Lotta Lotta like musicians and like really cool people and they're living in

808
00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:52.420
like one of the most picture as parts of the world.
Like those,

809
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.030
like the mountains,
like the Asheville,
North Carolina,
that whole area on man.

810
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:01.020
Dude,
it's ridiculous.
Just lakes,
trees and shit.

811
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:05.160
Same kind of property.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
man.
It's sure.

812
00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:10.050
Asheville itself,
it's probably a little more expensive,
but outside of it,
man,

813
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.520
she can get giant chunks of land.
Man,
you can get just beautiful setups,

814
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:17.280
houses on lakes and shit.
Can you shoot your guns?

815
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.860
I'll sure if you have a certain amount of acreage.

816
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:24.210
There's a show mountain men that I watch,
one of the dudes is in North Carolina,

817
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.960
but I've seen those commercials for it.
It's this shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

818
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:29.370
if you're interested in this subject,

819
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.460
<v 6>my favorite show on TV is the one where they hunt the gators,
swamp</v>

820
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.650
swamp people,
and a perfect example of why hunting should exist.

821
00:46:38.651 --> 00:46:40.000
If those guys didn't hunt the gators,

822
00:46:40.001 --> 00:46:43.330
they hunted every year and gators would be eating a lot of children.
Yeah,

823
00:46:43.331 --> 00:46:45.430
well it'd be a lot more gators.
I look at it.

824
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.230
<v 0>Well that's insane.
Yeah,
that's Asheville.
I mean,
are you kidding me?
That water?</v>

825
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.230
It's paradise up there.
It's fucking paradise.
Yeah.

826
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.410
I mean I would have to see what it would be like man.
We need,

827
00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:57.610
I would think about living in a place like

828
00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.260
<v 6>or laying on them private jets and hanging out with them.</v>

829
00:47:00.261 --> 00:47:01.940
Hedge Fund type motherfuckers.
Man.

830
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.150
You don't get any time with any hedge fund motherfuckers that needs,
you know,

831
00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:07.700
their bat mitzvah or Bar Mitzvah played.
You know what I mean?

832
00:47:07.701 --> 00:47:10.640
I'm just trying to get down and be your home and you know I won't come at you

833
00:47:10.641 --> 00:47:14.310
too tough.
I'll throw some of that advice at me.
You know what?

834
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:17.990
He helped me get into the fast lane,
get into the,
I'm stacking my chips,

835
00:47:17.991 --> 00:47:22.130
but it's slow grind.
I'm looking for that hedge fund dude.
Like I like,

836
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:25.910
I like every last,
I want to smoke some dope.
Where are you at?
Holler.

837
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.010
That's what I'm talking about.
You don't want that money,
Bro.
You want

838
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.000
<v 2>the money that you're making.</v>

839
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.730
You don't want that hedge fund money that that money smells like blood.

840
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.990
But you know what,
by a lot of soap

841
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.460
detergent,
you know what's really going to bum me out,
man.

842
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.100
It sounds crazy.
But when,
when they start making real engines for cars,

843
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.880
you know a friend of mine had a Prius and I know it's the future.

844
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.090
I know it's progress.
The thing makes no noise.
It's electric.

845
00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:02.920
It's awesome on gas uses less resources but goddamn it was boring as he drove

846
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:05.710
away.
I was like listen to what the fuck that sounds like.

847
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.140
Are we gonna not enjoy driving anymore?

848
00:48:08.141 --> 00:48:09.620
Is it really going to get to that at some point?

849
00:48:09.621 --> 00:48:12.850
I think there's still always going to probably do it just for the,
you know,

850
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:15.150
there's going to be one company like Porsche is going to be like,
I ahead.

851
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.340
We're always going to make a engine,
you know,

852
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.380
wonder if there'll be allowed to because they're putting all sorts of crazy

853
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:23.320
restrictions on them as far as like,
you know,
the future.

854
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:27.070
Like what they're going to have to be able to do as far as the emissions.

855
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.790
So why a lot of companies are forced to go to turbo charging because uh,
the,

856
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:32.380
the emission standards are so high,

857
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.960
they're going to lose the thrill of what an engine is like.
I want to,

858
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:39.540
whenever you come over here,
I've got,
and Van,
I love that fucking car.

859
00:48:39.541 --> 00:48:43.690
You drive that Audi.
Come on,
do it.
We could try it for a week or so.
Dove car.

860
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.400
It's,
he's got to get an a real clutch though.
A real manual transmission bro.

861
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:51.190
That little,
those little paddle shifters,
the paddle shifters,

862
00:48:51.191 --> 00:48:54.640
it's no fun now the car,
like that song in Los Angeles,
it last name,

863
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.960
I can't fucking happen if it's going to be the only car you drive apps,
you know?

864
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.190
<v 6>Yeah.
And it's,
I'm just,
I'm just a car was an impulse buy man.</v>

865
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:03.760
It was,

866
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.760
I went into the spot mad at BMW cause like they had jacked up their price on the

867
00:49:09.221 --> 00:49:12.190
seven series and I was mad.
I was like,

868
00:49:12.191 --> 00:49:16.660
it went from like 80 to 110 or something.
And I was just like,
man,
that,

869
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.160
I was like,
okay.
And I was like,
I'm going to go just,
I'm just,

870
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.840
I was just going to go look at some other things.
I looked at her,

871
00:49:21.841 --> 00:49:22.870
a bunch of other cars,

872
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.020
looked at an Audi and I looked at a Bentley and I looked at all these other cars

873
00:49:27.021 --> 00:49:31.300
and I was thinking maybe it was just weak sauce to me,
boring.
And then,
I mean,

874
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:34.660
this was a row of dealers of all these cars.
It's right here.
Actually,

875
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:39.610
I won't mention them cause they ain't paying me,
but you know,

876
00:49:39.611 --> 00:49:41.710
it's always fine.
But to get back out to where my car was,

877
00:49:41.711 --> 00:49:45.220
I had to walk back into the Audi dealership and that's when I saw they had an

878
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.670
all white or eight in the corner.
And I just went over looking at it like,
wow,

879
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:49.840
that's kind of sharp,
you know?

880
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.410
And Kate came over and started talking to me and he was like,
yeah,

881
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:56.570
I got a black on black one out back.
I was like,

882
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.700
I know I'm not going to buy his car.
Right.
Yeah,
sure,
sure.
Show it to me man.

883
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:03.460
You know,
show it to me and like how you want to take it for a spin.
And he's,

884
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.220
I was like,
oh I could drive it.
He's like,
Nah,
I could take you for a spin though,

885
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.410
you know.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
okay.
I was like,
well whatever,
let's go.

886
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:12.400
I've got time to kill.
Took me first span.
Took me up until we're in backwards.

887
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:15.240
The rose bowl is and then pulled the car over and got out and he's trying to

888
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.270
kiss you.
I didn't know.

889
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.110
I was worried though for a second cause he pulled the car over man.

890
00:50:20.111 --> 00:50:22.100
He pulled the car over.
I was like,
what are you doing man?

891
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:23.260
And then he got out the car and he's like,

892
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:25.000
yo go ahead and you could drive the car.
And I took it.

893
00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:28.070
That was the smartest thing he ever day cause I took that car like 15 minutes.

894
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.020
<v 4>Just went nuts.
Did you ever had a car like that before?
No.
Not that.</v>

895
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:35.610
No.
Not like sport car like that.
I wasn't eating.

896
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.530
I mean I had way back when like at eight 51st came off for the BMW.

897
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:41.980
I had that and then I drove,
I can't fuck with what you got done.

898
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.833
And then I drove,

899
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.550
I drove seven series for the all the rest of that time I was really like a,

900
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.980
that's what I did.
I'd always have a truck and I'd have my beat,

901
00:50:48.981 --> 00:50:53.981
my little BMW seven so your car is mid engine car and that layout is the best

902
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:56.330
layout as far as like handling feel.

903
00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.110
And that's such a great balance on rails man.
Yeah,

904
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:04.670
the engine is actually in front of the rear wheels so it just rides like a

905
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:09.430
fucking dream.
Just rides on a dream.
It's fun.
It's a meaningful cost space.

906
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.580
Shit,
I got the aid,

907
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:13.190
I didn't get the 10 because that's the car they had right there.
Right.

908
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.680
And I said,
give it to me.
I want this car right now.

909
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.070
Realistically you don't need that 10 and if you want it,

910
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.050
what we're saying eight cylinder over 10 solar.
But if you want it to,

911
00:51:21.051 --> 00:51:26.051
there's a company that puts a supercharger under the eight and makes it more

912
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:30.320
powerful than the V 10 and it doesn't cost that much and it's safe and they know

913
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:31.910
what the fuck they're doing.
They're not doing it by a long way,

914
00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:36.290
like you're saying it the way it grounds it sounds awesome man.
It was nice.

915
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.041
The supercharger,

916
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:40.160
we'll add a little extra wide and keeps the little boy and me alive.

917
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.030
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
It's fun.
Right?
It's telling me I have a,

918
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:48.570
I'm one of those uh,
Shelby gt 500 mustangs.
You know what?
Those are all ways.

919
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.880
It was a,
it's a one of the,
one of the newer ones and the sound of it alone.

920
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:55.310
I swear to God,
it just gives me a smile.

921
00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.970
It makes me smile when I hit the gas and I shifted gears just to hear that

922
00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:01.640
engine roar it for I think from men.

923
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:05.390
I don't think any one has ever like fully documented it,

924
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:08.360
but I think there's like a physiological thing that happens when you hit like a

925
00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:11.450
strong engine.
I think there's something happening to your body.

926
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.320
It makes you actually feel good.
You know,
it was like an animal grounded.

927
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.160
I think it's,
it probably produces testosterone or something like that.

928
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.710
I've read that.
I feel like I've read that.
You're laughing,
right?

929
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.860
No,
no.
I,
I could see it probably doing something like that.
He was giving him,

930
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.470
the first night I had a dog,

931
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:35.471
I was just taking it out and I was hitting corners doing 35 45 for Cornell

932
00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.570
drive.
Dude.
I was like,
there's a,

933
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:42.080
there's a button you hit on it where the shocks fill up with fluid so you don't

934
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:45.660
even lean magnetic suspension.
It just,
yeah,
it was like wow.

935
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.300
It was like being on a freaking roller coaster man.
Is this?
Yes.
Yes.

936
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:54.020
It's called the Audi r eight and they have a v eight version of ie 10 version

937
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.590
and actually a lot of people think that the [inaudible] doesn't handle as well

938
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.520
because it's still got a bigger engine and there's a little bit more weight

939
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.050
biased.
Yeah.

940
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:06.170
The engine and the v eight is smaller engine and a lot of people actually enjoy

941
00:53:06.171 --> 00:53:09.020
that car more,
but they started to put a supercharges on them,

942
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:12.860
so they jack it up to like 560 horsepower and they're insane.

943
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:18.050
Insane.
I chew up tires like crazy and great.
I love cars,
man.

944
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:20.960
I just loved that someone invented it.
Such a fucking,
you know,

945
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:25.470
you're getting a good car and took it to that level.
So that's like a space man.

946
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:29.460
Well,
that's odd.
I was like,
man,
that's a bad ass car.
There's cars now like the,

947
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:34.830
you know,
like the Shelby Shelby gt 500 they have a new one that's out that 660

948
00:53:34.831 --> 00:53:38.310
horsepower.
It's a fucking ridiculous thing to own.

949
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.510
Nobody should be able to just go into a store and without proving that you don't

950
00:53:41.511 --> 00:53:42.870
have to drive a God damn race car,

951
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.110
get a car stock off the shelf with a 660 plus horsepower engine,

952
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.380
but you can go get it.

953
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.240
You can go get it right now and you hit that ball and it just,
it just exciting.

954
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:57.720
It was good.
Little little,
little goosebumps.
Even if you don't drive it fast,

955
00:53:57.721 --> 00:54:00.000
like you got a smile on your face while you're driving.

956
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.450
Women will never understand that.
They just want to look good,

957
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.560
just want to look good hair in their car and have a nice shiny clean car.

958
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.220
Something,
something to stand it down just on a different level.

959
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:14.340
But the ones who want to be in that car and then when they know they'd rather be

960
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:18.030
in that car,
then the guy with the rust it up to her cell.
That's true.

961
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:20.440
But what I'm saying is I think,
uh,

962
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:25.140
there's like especially muscle cars to something incredibly masculine about
them.

963
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.303
Something,

964
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.420
something that I don't think I'm so a woman will have a complete tune into.

965
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.460
It's an,
it's a beast.
You,
they sound like bs.
Controlling a beast.

966
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:40.080
Your hardest thing.
500 horses worth of power.

967
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.040
This is a ridiculous 500 horse all about.

968
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.950
That's why I say it keeps the little boy in me alive.
He's playing with.

969
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:51.980
I got fucking 400 horsepowers 400 horsepower and the aluminum car with all wheel

970
00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:54.690
drive,

971
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.800
but but rear wheel drive characteristics because I'd only ever gives 30% of the

972
00:54:58.801 --> 00:54:59.820
power of the real world,

973
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.150
so it just helps you in corners and shit like that thing in sport and I'll put

974
00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:08.070
that shock thing on.
It's crazy.
It's fun.
I mean,
I'm going to lie.

975
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.280
Well,
when you think about technology and you think about how much things have

976
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:15.240
progressed,
one of the best ways to look at it,
it's cars,
cars,
cars.

977
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:19.860
Today you get like they have cars that goes zero to 60 in less than three

978
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:24.660
seconds and that's normal and you can get them at Nissan.
Okay,
that's insane.

979
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:29.490
A Nissan GTR is zero to 60 in 2.7 or 2.8 seconds.

980
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:34.680
That's mind blowing.
It's so hard to wrap your head around the fact that one,
two,

981
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.930
three you're going 60 fucking miles an hour.

982
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.100
That's an insane car for a regular person to be able to buy and they're making

983
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:43.350
them better every year.
Every year it's faster.

984
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:45.750
Every year they got this with Germany,

985
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:47.580
they have this course called the Nurburgring.

986
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.390
It's like the one that they benchmark a lot of performance cars on it because

987
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.010
there's all these turns and twists.

988
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:57.480
So it gives a real accurate representation of how fast you could drive with this

989
00:55:57.481 --> 00:55:58.770
car in the real world.

990
00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.490
And those motherfuckers go around it and it was insane.

991
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:06.240
Speed is videos of them online.
I'll watch them for hours on end.

992
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.990
I'll watch like here's a Ferrari four five eight on the Nurburg rang,
here's,

993
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:11.640
and they showed them to you from the cockpit.

994
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.440
So it's like all of them around seven minutes and 50 seconds,
seven 40 seconds.

995
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.340
So for seven minutes,
just sitting in there with the youtube on screen and going,

996
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.440
how could,
how could you not appreciate that?

997
00:56:27.441 --> 00:56:29.960
How can you not appreciate what somebody is engineered?

998
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.530
Something that hurls you around corners,

999
00:56:33.531 --> 00:56:37.180
like slightly sideways controlling it.
So

1000
00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:41.210
<v 6>wild a watch,
man.
I spent most of my summer in Europe,</v>

1001
00:56:41.211 --> 00:56:44.570
so every time we were on the Autobahn I was,
man,
I wish I had my car here.

1002
00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:47.330
Just just stop it.
Just to open it up.

1003
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:52.390
I've opened it up over there to 10 that back over the mountains where there

1004
00:56:52.761 --> 00:56:55.890
ain't much later than they got it up to like one 60 sound,

1005
00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.820
the two tens of beautiful.
Then I started getting real jittery,

1006
00:57:01.821 --> 00:57:03.590
like the highly copters going to see me here,

1007
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:07.310
so I'm going to turn into like a high speed pursuit on the news and so I got

1008
00:57:07.311 --> 00:57:09.590
back down.
Well those days are

1009
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.640
<v 4>on the way out,
man.
With the advent of drones,</v>

1010
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:13.970
you're not going to be able to get away with that shit.

1011
00:57:13.971 --> 00:57:16.510
They'll have drones in the night.
Sky Monitoring people speed.

1012
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.940
<v 6>Here we go on.
You got you.
Got You on video doing 106</v>

1013
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.680
<v 4>ah man.
Yeah.
You won't be able to fuck with it.
I mean this,
there's no way.</v>

1014
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.290
There's no way they're gonna not gonna have that locked down.

1015
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:30.190
If there really are going to be 30,000 drones in the sky in 10 years.

1016
00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:33.600
That's what they're said.
Surveillance drones.
He the fuck crafts.

1017
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.680
They're going to cut back on all the fun.
Yeah.

1018
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.450
<v 6>Well that's when you,
when you bought the city man.
Oh,</v>

1019
00:57:38.451 --> 00:57:40.630
they're going to have it out there too,
dude.
They're going to have it everywhere.

1020
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.490
It's more,
it's easier probably to notice probably,

1021
00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:47.900
unless you're talking about these little mosquito Mike robot things that you see

1022
00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:49.220
every once in a while pop up.

1023
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.120
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.300
Well that's another thing that I heard that was really creepy about some cars,

1025
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:56.180
some cars they without even you even knowing it,

1026
00:57:56.210 --> 00:58:00.230
they keep a data log of how fast you've driven it.
It's like a,

1027
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.550
they can go into it and they can like access it and they can find out like,

1028
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.690
what are you doing asshole?

1029
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.420
You're going 150 fucking miles an hour where you want to track like,

1030
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:11.060
what are you,
what are you doing here?
Like what,
why are you going this fast?

1031
00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.030
Like they can find that out from,
you could find out where you were from,

1032
00:58:14.031 --> 00:58:15.670
your gps locations.
It's like you're,

1033
00:58:15.671 --> 00:58:18.410
you're carrying a record of all your whereabouts.

1034
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.630
I'll be a little blank box somewhere in there.
My show there is,

1035
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:25.840
especially if you're,
I don't put anything past anyone.
Uh,

1036
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:27.680
have you heard of this?
Um,

1037
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:32.790
this a new thing that was released by wikileaks called trap wire.
Uh,

1038
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.830
I'm having a dude come on.
The guy who broke the story,
he's coming on the 28th,

1039
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.970
um,
I think it's the 20th.
Anyway,
the,
um,
w what it is,

1040
00:58:40.971 --> 00:58:45.971
is they've figured out a way to take all surveillance cameras from all over the

1041
00:58:46.041 --> 00:58:51.041
country and work them through a centralized database where they were literally

1042
00:58:51.081 --> 00:58:53.720
store all of the information,

1043
00:58:53.721 --> 00:58:56.870
like every movement that's happening in cities and in areas,

1044
00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:01.670
they've got a complete massive database on everything that everyone's ever done

1045
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:05.090
for like the last few years.
Like they're starting to do it in these,

1046
00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.340
in these areas.
And they're,

1047
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:11.240
they're putting it in a centralized anyways without letting anybody know.
Wow.

1048
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.010
It's crazy.
I don't know the,
but somehow or another they're all linked through,

1049
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.470
you know,
homes,
homeland security or whatever the fuck it is.

1050
00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:22.010
It's whatever organization is taking the,
from all these different

1051
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.760
<v 0>places.</v>

1052
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:27.230
But there are amassing a database of all of our activities all the time without

1053
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:28.340
anybody even knowing about it.

1054
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.640
And what's really crazy about that is that this is just this,

1055
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:35.960
this marks and ethic.
All right,
it's,
it marks like this is what they're thinking.

1056
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:37.640
They would like to monitor us all the time.

1057
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:40.070
So they're doing it as much as they can.
We'll eventually,

1058
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:44.090
the technology is going to be better.
So as technology gets better,

1059
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.100
they're going to have shit everywhere.
They're going to be able to,

1060
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.020
they're going to be to look at you everywhere.
That's what they do.

1061
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.040
It's what they do.
He can't stop them.
How's that going to stop?

1062
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.830
Are we gonna stop that?
It's going to make for a lot

1063
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.490
<v 1>better a those videos like this hidden camera videos.</v>

1064
00:59:58.491 --> 01:00:00.780
I could look at this person and he fell down and

1065
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.560
<v 6>cat videos cause your cats do a lot of wacky shit while you were at work and</v>

1066
01:00:04.561 --> 01:00:08.430
this way you can go back and review.
Let's see what skippy got in to today.
Oh,

1067
01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:10.350
you little asshole dragon out of the toilet again.

1068
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.570
<v 1>I heard there was a study recently where they put these cameras on cats and
they,</v>

1069
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.910
they,
they found out that cats are,

1070
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.120
they murder way more than they originally thought.

1071
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:25.070
Like these catches did nothing but like murder animals,
squirrels,
birds,
insects.

1072
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.820
And they just are like,

1073
01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:28.910
they go and killing sprees every time they go out of the house.

1074
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.870
<v 6>No,
I've never been a cat tree.
I've always felt doing,</v>

1075
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:36.820
we're kind of the creepy dark.
Oh yeah,
I saw,
I see.

1076
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.580
For me it was also one time I was many,
many years ago.

1077
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:42.200
I'm gonna mess them with some broad,

1078
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:47.230
she had a cat and I saw a cat go from the counter and jump up onto the top of

1079
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.500
the like shower door,
which is like,
you know,

1080
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.200
it's like jumping on a balance beam but 12 feet above that if you were a gymnast

1081
01:00:56.201 --> 01:00:59.870
jumping 12 feet up and landing on a balance beam perfectly well and that's when

1082
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:03.230
I was like,
Yo,
I don't,
I don't trust anything that could do that.

1083
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.200
It was half magical thinking,
fuck you up.
Like,

1084
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.570
I'm not talking about running and jumping,

1085
01:01:08.571 --> 01:01:11.780
like standing there and springing up onto some shit and I was like,
no,

1086
01:01:11.781 --> 01:01:13.610
that was some,
that was some magical shit.

1087
01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:14.913
<v 0>Rod Iron,</v>

1088
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.920
iron railing that curls on my staircase and this wrought iron iron railing is

1089
01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:25.210
only about three fingers wide.
Like maybe three of my fat fingers won.

1090
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:29.710
My cat walks it.
He walks it like a tight rope all the way up to the top.

1091
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:36.350
<v 6>Yeah,
he's there 12 feet above,
you know,
a hard stone floor.</v>

1092
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.200
It's motherfucking okay.
He's just chilling.
I know.
Fear of man.

1093
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.020
There's all kinds of old like,
like you know,

1094
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:45.770
creepy tales about cats and they used to like sit on the chest of children and

1095
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:48.170
suck their breath down and go.
They wouldn't let him.

1096
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.870
I did lie on babies because they're warm and when they lie on the 18 months

1097
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:54.550
smother them.
Yeah.
That's like that Shit's real.
You know,

1098
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.030
they turned that into many of folk.

1099
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.990
But could you imagine if you're fucking it up in your kitchen,

1100
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:00.500
like smothered your kid?

1101
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.250
<v 0>Oh,
it's so scary,
man.
That's so cool.</v>

1102
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:10.040
<v 6>Or too smart.
I mean cancer just too damn smart.
They creeping cats,
robots.</v>

1103
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:14.600
We just don't know it yet and totally like really don't give a shit about you

1104
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.320
unless they want something from you.
They want to be pet all the time.

1105
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:20.130
They want constant or fuck

1106
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.790
<v 0>you.
Yeah.
It's funny,
Eddie Bravo was just starting to realize cats,
cancer cunts.</v>

1107
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:27.750
Now that he has kid,
he loves his son so much.
Ma'Am.
I tell him,
you know,

1108
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:30.330
he's talking to me about how much he loves his bunny,

1109
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.330
how much he loves cats and I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
that's all nice and good.

1110
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.650
Wait till you see little man.

1111
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:38.100
Wait till you have a son that you were ready to kill those cats with a hammer.

1112
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.360
Trust me.
Obviously I was joking around.
I have cats.
I love my cats.

1113
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:46.380
They're creepy,
but I love him.
But man,
he now,
he's like this fucking cats.

1114
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:49.770
They make noise when the kids asleep on purpose,
they're trying to wake him up.

1115
01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.930
Like he,
I try to keep them out of the room.

1116
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:53.700
So they go in there and knock shit over,
let,

1117
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:56.910
they'll knock shit over and run around the,
you know,
the hallway.
They're like,

1118
01:02:56.911 --> 01:03:00.240
they're fucking with him and he's realizing it and he's like,
oh my God,

1119
01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:04.020
I'm living with a bunch of cunts.
Cancer,
crazy jealous little twats.

1120
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.730
I would get a cat,
like if I lived like in the hills or something and I had,

1121
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.940
you know,
something I'd have,
I keep a cat like a outdoor indoor cat.

1122
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:16.980
Those are bad for bad news for the sake of keeping off any,

1123
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.300
you know,
rodents and whatnot.

1124
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.630
You shouldn't fuck with outdoor indoor cats for the simple reason of parasites.

1125
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.010
Outdoor,
an outdoor cat.
I'll give them all outdoor or all indoor.

1126
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.210
But even I would have,
they served a purpose like as just strictly a pet for me.

1127
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:34.320
I'm a dog guy,
always been a dog guy.
Well,
you know,
feral cats,

1128
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.070
people have traditionally had them on farms in order to just,
I mean,

1129
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.290
semi feral just to keep the,

1130
01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:40.650
the rat population down because whenever you have a farm,

1131
01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:44.940
you're going to have a lot of rodents.
But that cat parasite shit is no joke,
man.

1132
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:48.960
A lot of people have real problems in their life because of this cap parasite.

1133
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.860
And it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's affected massive amount of Europe,

1134
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.630
massive amount of South America not even hit.
It's all,
it's all toxo plasma.

1135
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:02.460
It's,
um,
they're just discovering it within the last few years.
And,
uh,

1136
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:05.570
one of the things that are discovering is that it leads to a disproportional

1137
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.820
amount of motorcycle victims.
So I think it affects your judgment and a,

1138
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.410
it also,
they said there's a lot of soccer teams,
like,

1139
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.110
like really successful soccer teams,
uh,

1140
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.490
come from countries where they test high with high levels of Toxoplasma because

1141
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:23.250
it makes you reckless.
It makes men,

1142
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.450
so apparently it makes them more aggressive and may perhaps even generate more

1143
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:31.500
testosterone.
But essentially it's a fucking parasite that you get from cats.

1144
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:36.240
And it,
it completely rewires the way you're,
you're thinking is like Dave,

1145
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.030
there's one as an article that's written online.

1146
01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.760
It was a fascinating article by a neurosurgeon who has it and he knew something

1147
01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:45.000
was wrong.
It's totally incurable when you have it,
you can live with it,

1148
01:04:45.001 --> 01:04:49.110
but it affects your judgment and it comes from fucking cats and it's creepy.

1149
01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:53.730
It's a behavioral change her.
So cats get it from rats and rats.

1150
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.850
What happens is the rat gets it and when the rat gets it,

1151
01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.660
the rat gets sexually attracted.
The smell of cat piss.

1152
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:04.770
So it's some renders itself basically to runs right to the whole,

1153
01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.570
like every night shower learn it is and it's real.

1154
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.820
I mean that's really scary.

1155
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.450
That is like m night Shyamalan here and we all sit around when thinking about,

1156
01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:18.190
you know,
how arrogantly we're going to ruin or kill them,
take

1157
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.600
<v 4>over the world or anything.
I was,</v>

1158
01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:22.660
it takes is one cat parasite dude and we're all screwed man.

1159
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:26.260
You know what I mean?
The wrong one.
And,
and we're let that aerosol eyes.
Well,

1160
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:28.030
they say that sneeze on a plane.

1161
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.150
50 million people are affected by it in this country alone.

1162
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.670
Crazy 50 million in Brazil.

1163
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:38.671
It's like 60% and parts of France at one point in time it was as high as 80% now

1164
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:43.450
it's down to the 50s but 50% that's half the fucking people have this cat

1165
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:47.530
parasite.
Half of them that changes your behavior.
Wow.

1166
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.080
Fucking nuts.
There's a guy named [inaudible] Paul Ski.

1167
01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:53.650
I got to get them on this podcast.
I have to talk to Tim.
Talk to them about this,

1168
01:05:53.651 --> 01:05:55.970
if you ever has free time.
But he's a professor and a,

1169
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.290
he specializes in it and it's crazy.
And he'd tell you,
he's the one who,
uh,

1170
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:03.610
he has a great video.
Sucks.
So Plasma Toxoplasma Gondii,

1171
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.350
toxoplasmosis Gundy.

1172
01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:08.470
I think it was the actual name that out the fucking terrifying man.

1173
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.110
That's why outdoor cats can go fuck themselves.
You know,

1174
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:13.930
you gotta get up gotta keep away from those creepy bitches.
They might,

1175
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:17.920
they might get you with their dirty shit.
General not like cats,
man.

1176
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.260
And I'm a Leo,
but isn't that weird?
Be What?
A crazy.
It's cold.

1177
01:06:22.261 --> 01:06:26.410
We're all Leos here.
Yeah.
And we're all getting along.
Isn't it crazy though,

1178
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.340
that you could,

1179
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:31.960
you could figure out a way to wire an animal's Dick,

1180
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:37.020
so it gets hard when it smells like cat piss the pice of its murderer.

1181
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:42.930
Could you imagine some devious Stevie shit that's physically and spiritually

1182
01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:48.340
just
that's just,
that's an next,

1183
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:53.370
that's Freddy Krueger nightmare shit right there that somebody could just spit

1184
01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:56.530
on you or transfer a fluid or breathe on you.

1185
01:06:56.770 --> 01:07:01.770
And all of a sudden now there are agents at work within your body to make you

1186
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:04.360
behave differently.
So guys,

1187
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:08.890
to the killing of you by that person would be made much easier.
Wow,

1188
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:13.840
that's awesome.
And a whole species like cats,

1189
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:19.120
you're going,
your cat's like,
what the fuck cats,

1190
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.260
the one thing that wants to kill you all the time and nature is like,
Yep,
Yep,

1191
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:26.080
Yep,
Yep,
Yep.
That's where we want to go next.
That's where we want to go next.

1192
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.500
Go over there,
please smell that.
I mean,
it's almost smells like cat.

1193
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:32.950
It's almost impossible to imagine that that wasn't engineered.

1194
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:37.750
It makes you stop and go,
who the fuck is working behind the curtain here?

1195
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.910
That seems engineered.

1196
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:45.630
That seems like if you wanted to point to some sort of intelligent design of the

1197
01:07:46.121 --> 01:07:49.900
universe,
I think things like that are compelling topics,

1198
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.840
not necessarily evidence but compelling topics.

1199
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:56.170
When it comes to the debate of there being some sort of intelligence to this

1200
01:07:56.171 --> 01:08:00.060
whole thing.
What the fuck?
I mean how does it randomly happened?
He like,

1201
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:05.070
if we could go scratched a chicken and a week later it's at our doorstep cooked

1202
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.100
like waiting for us to eat it.
Yeah.

1203
01:08:09.101 --> 01:08:11.980
We just throw some powder out there in the field and he just had the urge to

1204
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:15.190
throw itself on a roasting grill and and feed itself to,

1205
01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:20.191
it's a hard dick wandering with their stupid black rat eyes.

1206
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.080
Dead eyes looking for cat piss with a heart on fuck kind of world is this.

1207
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:27.890
You know what this happened?
Look at the TV

1208
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:36.440
videos of cats doing hilarious shit with their bodies.

1209
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.640
You can watch those.
My daughter watches those four hours.

1210
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:42.890
That's might be aliens student.
They might be,
I think their robot.

1211
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:45.980
I think their technology,
well,
I just think they're super killers.

1212
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:49.230
I think that nature needs cleanup and in order to make sure that the,

1213
01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:52.700
the limping fucks don't make it,
there's cats.
That's really what it is.

1214
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.100
And they're,
they're,
they're the little ones.

1215
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.190
That's what I'm saying.
Like the devil picked it up and walked away,

1216
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:09.020
<v 2>got up on two legs and walked out.
It's the most,
what's the name of that?</v>

1217
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:11.840
Just so people could see a cat walking on.
Oh,

1218
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.810
thriller cat thriller cat doctor about week for it.

1219
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:20.220
<v 4>Thriller Chat.
Wait for it.
Oh,
it's so silly.
They're nature's cleanup man.</v>

1220
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:24.160
They're there to make sure that,
uh,
that it's tough to learn when they do,

1221
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:28.920
when somebody domesticated cat who decided that have any shit and piss in a box

1222
01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:29.880
was a great idea.

1223
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:32.610
It's only keeping the house if you're going to keep me in the house,

1224
01:09:32.611 --> 01:09:33.540
they have to have a place to shit.

1225
01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.600
<v 1>Dear Armin has it go in the toilet and</v>

1226
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.100
she has this bald cats where they're all shaved and she's trained it to just use

1227
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:42.810
the toilet.

1228
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:45.430
<v 2>I guess.
That's right.
If you're not letting it out of the house,</v>

1229
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.390
could you imagine the things that her cat is soon?
Oh God,

1230
01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:55.090
no wonder where the cat goes.
Traumatized.
Doesn't even know it's a cat.

1231
01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.250
Cat pieces is a person that can't talk,
doesn't know what the fuck is up.

1232
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.150
Yeah.
It's weird having an animal shitting in your house.
It's gross.
Yeah.

1233
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:08.260
Fucking nasty.
I'm not down with it anymore.

1234
01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.550
I will turn off to me like if I would show up at some chicks house or something

1235
01:10:12.551 --> 01:10:17.090
and I would smell that smell.
It's awful.
Oh there's a litter box in gross.

1236
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:18.520
Especially if you're lazy and you know,

1237
01:10:18.521 --> 01:10:21.640
clean the piss out and you walk in the house.
Do you have that ammonia smell?

1238
01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:23.290
Like what?
That's so dangerous

1239
01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.730
<v 1>for you?
Like they're,
they,
they're always watching animal hoarders on Netflix,</v>

1240
01:10:26.731 --> 01:10:30.090
which is one of the worst fucking TV shows in the whole entire road.

1241
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.620
I don't know if you've ever watched it.

1242
01:10:31.621 --> 01:10:34.890
There was even one guy that had like over like 10,000 rats.

1243
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:39.510
Like is his wife died and then he bought a rat for some reason cause she liked

1244
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.080
rats.
And then there's just thousands and thousands of rats.
But uh,

1245
01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:44.400
one thing is the ammonia.

1246
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:48.990
There was this guy that owned I think 90 cats in a one bedroom or something like

1247
01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:52.920
that and the ammonia was so bad,
like the toxic level with something like crazy,

1248
01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:57.921
like 12% he had it like 90% like his air quality was just all ammonia.

1249
01:10:58.330 --> 01:10:59.163
Wow.

1250
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:04.110
<v 2>That's crazy.
That's crazy.
It was just sometimes with the wifey man,</v>

1251
01:11:04.111 --> 01:11:07.080
every once in a while somebody will have so much stuff they'll put like a flat

1252
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:11.640
dead cat.
Oh yeah.
Wait,
watch animal hoarders,
they will freak you out.

1253
01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:13.980
They find dead cats.
All the weird

1254
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.860
<v 6>that a lot of people do that and you start storing animals in their house.</v>

1255
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:22.110
They need more animals or just even junk.
Yeah,
junk orders.
Was it crazy?

1256
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.990
That's her best.
Like throw out old newspapers once.

1257
01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:27.480
Like my table gets too cluttered.
I stopped some of this shit.

1258
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:28.590
Got to get thrown out.
Man,

1259
01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:33.591
that's out refreshed myself by got rid of all the magazines in my office.

1260
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.870
I had like a stack of magazines stack.
Maybe you got to let go.
Some of my stuff.

1261
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.600
It was like maybe 200 magazines.
I've been good at that though.

1262
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:46.470
I don't even have a lot of my own memorabilia and things like that cause I give

1263
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:49.560
everything away and I,
that's beautiful.
You know what I mean?
I wound up giving,

1264
01:11:49.561 --> 01:11:53.160
you know,
it'll impact them more than an impact.
You,
you know,
to have a guy,

1265
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:57.240
he's a real Everlast memorabilia in your house.
You know,
it's just,
you know,

1266
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:00.390
things sooner.
I've had it all lost at all,

1267
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:01.950
had it all I said all a couple of times.

1268
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.770
So it's like I'm really attached to like not being attached.

1269
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:08.730
Well that is the thing.
That's the best story.
The had it all lost.
It all.
Got It.

1270
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:11.160
Backstories to best store in here.
People love that.

1271
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.670
They love people that fuck up.
I do.
I love people that,

1272
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.120
cause I know that's what I do.
I have fun.

1273
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.440
I love people that can figure things out or that get through adversity or that

1274
01:12:19.441 --> 01:12:23.220
go over a hump or that get thrown a curve ball and they figured out how to hit

1275
01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:27.930
it next time.
Hey,
you know,
they're the most interesting.
I get up the next day.

1276
01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.280
Yeah.
I'm still gonna.
You know,
I remember like in the middle of my troubles,

1277
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:37.050
my troubles have them because of,
you know,
I had to,
uh,
I quit house of pain.

1278
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.770
I was doing a record in my label.
Didn't even believe in the whole white board.

1279
01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.200
Right?
Yeah.
We went over that and then,
you know,
I'd given up,
like I had the tax,

1280
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:50.220
my accountant ripped me off for some taxes and I canceled my insurance.

1281
01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:51.870
So it was like the perfect storm of like,

1282
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:56.260
here's the perfect time for your heart thing to happen to you right now.
Well,

1283
01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.230
it's a perfect movie though,
you know,

1284
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.570
and then the bounce back with a bounce back was kind of luck,
you know,

1285
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:06.240
put your lights on that was not locked to that song.
It's tremendous,
man.
Yeah.

1286
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.780
You know what,
that's,
you know,
that was a result of,
like I said,

1287
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:12.420
Song with you and coming out to hospital so,
well,
you know,

1288
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:15.540
I wrote the song and do play a little bit of that again on his album.

1289
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:19.170
Put a little bit of that on,
but God damn,
that's a good song,
dude.
Oh,

1290
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:24.780
and then that song,
that song had,
that song had some real feeling in it,

1291
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:28.440
man.
There was a lot going on in that song.
Yeah.
But I remember like my accounts,

1292
01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.140
it was telling me to file for bankruptcy and all this and I was like,

1293
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:35.100
you know what?
I ain't going to do it.
I ain't going to do it cause I ain't,

1294
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:38.990
you know what I mean?
God forbid I ever really had to do it,
but I was like,
I'm,

1295
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.760
I paint.
My Dad says,
the way I look at it,
I just like,
you know,

1296
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.180
I got screwed over by this guy.
I'm not going to tell 10 people over here.

1297
01:13:45.181 --> 01:13:48.900
I owe money to screw you because,
right.
Because I got screwed.

1298
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:50.820
I don't play that game.
You know what I mean?

1299
01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.440
Bankruptcy is kind of a tricky little situation.
Huh?

1300
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.290
I just remember the day I got the call from my accountant and said,
you know,

1301
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.690
my new accountants,
that was,
uh,

1302
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:06.000
that I broke even like that everything was paid.
All my debts,
my medical bills,

1303
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:08.730
everything was paid.
And you know,

1304
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.700
now you could start putting some money back in the bank.
Took like a year.
Wow.

1305
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:18.010
Some people it takes say whole life,
you know?
Yeah.
People can hit a spiral man.

1306
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.750
<v 7>Oh,
you love her.</v>

1307
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:34.140
Who is cooler than Carlos Santana?

1308
01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:39.070
Is anyone ever lived that's cooler than that guy?
He's undeniable.

1309
01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:45.480
I don't know that guy right there.
It's pretty fucking cool.
I mean,

1310
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:49.290
don't get me wrong,
but come on man.
Carlos Santana.

1311
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.460
What was it like working with him man?

1312
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:55.860
<v 6>Um,
it was cool.
It was like,
um,
I had written that song.</v>

1313
01:14:55.861 --> 01:14:57.510
I mean we've gone over the story a little bit.

1314
01:14:57.511 --> 01:14:59.280
Last time I'd written that song and I had it,
but like,

1315
01:14:59.281 --> 01:15:04.230
why are you forcing his blues was done and,
uh,
I was doing science night live.

1316
01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:06.630
I don't know if we talked about that part.
I was actually,
you know,

1317
01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:09.920
which was one of my like,
you know,
bucket list things,
you know,

1318
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.120
playing Saturday night.
Right.
Growing up as a kid.

1319
01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:16.320
That's why I learned about a lot of music.
Um,

1320
01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:18.470
so I'm playing soccer in our lab.
We're doing,

1321
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.220
we're doing like the day before rehearsal or something and somebody comes in the

1322
01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:23.860
rooms.
I killed Carlos,
the antennas and the building and he's looking for you.

1323
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.930
And I was like,
get the fuck Outta here.
Kind of shut up.
And like,

1324
01:15:27.931 --> 01:15:32.660
literally like 30 seconds later,
Carlos Santana walks in the room.
Wow.
Wow.

1325
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:37.050
And uh,
the guy who produced that song,
me,
Dante Ross had taken the liberty,

1326
01:15:37.051 --> 01:15:38.460
heard they were looking for songs,

1327
01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:42.540
he took the liberty of sending them the song and Santana fell in love with the

1328
01:15:42.541 --> 01:15:47.310
song.
It was the way I understand in the way of stories told to me is,

1329
01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:52.130
uh,
it was the first song chosen for that whole project.
So,
you know,

1330
01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:54.510
it was,
it was cool.
It was an honor.
You know,
I was like,

1331
01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:57.750
I got this song and I was going to save it from my second record,

1332
01:15:57.751 --> 01:16:00.270
but it was like,
you know,
they just seemed like an opportunity to,
you know,

1333
01:16:00.271 --> 01:16:01.104
I should take,

1334
01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:06.170
<v 4>fuck yeah,
man,
be right next to Carlos motherfucking Santana</v>

1335
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:10.830
<v 6>any anywhere.
I mean like,
you know,
and he was adamantly,</v>

1336
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:14.600
I'm not going to say the word bank cousin implies like some kind of,
you know,

1337
01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:18.210
really want to be involved,
wanted that song for his record.
He was like,
Yo,

1338
01:16:18.211 --> 01:16:20.290
I want this song for my record and I,

1339
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.640
and it was almost like I can't take no for an answer.
How do I,
you know,

1340
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.070
he was basically let me know he was being real cool about it.

1341
01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.310
Let me know how much he wanted that song.
And then you're like,

1342
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.790
you're buttered up by,
by Santana.
So it's like,
yeah.
All right.

1343
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:39.250
<v 4>Carlos Santana,
who is like made it through better than that guy.</v>

1344
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.350
He's made it through better than any of them.

1345
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:44.020
If you think about all the people from his era and generation,

1346
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:48.760
they're all dead and he's still relevant.
You know,
just stick around.
Fuck yeah.

1347
01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:53.450
Stick around and still blow it out man.
His music is still married to the Cindy.

1348
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:53.560
Yeah.

1349
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.950
<v 6>Black men that I remember that drummer used to be in Lenny Kravitz's band.</v>

1350
01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.460
Check with the big truck.
Yeah,
that's his wife.
And she's about,

1351
01:17:01.461 --> 01:17:03.830
I think she'd been drumming with him too.
I think faith plays for him.

1352
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
<v 4>Wow.
Yeah.</v>

1353
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:10.490
Very few people like hit that cool level like that Carlos Santana

1354
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.090
<v 6>level.
Like if you don't like Carlos Santana,
something's fucking wrong with you,</v>

1355
01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:18.350
man.
You got it.
You got your own problems.
You know it's not Carlos for sure.

1356
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.780
You know what I mean?
He didn't do nothing to you,
dude.

1357
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:25.790
He's just out there playing guitar.
Shut the fuck up.

1358
01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:29.270
So what do you want to play this man?
I don't know.

1359
01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:33.050
I figured I had to bring a guitar because I do look at the Twitter.

1360
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:37.750
Oh Dude,
raise.
It's harder now.
Now I'm now I'm going to ask,

1361
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.480
talking to you man over now.
But we love talking to you.

1362
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:43.160
Plus your music even more.

1363
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:44.983
<v 8>Well,</v>

1364
01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.200
<v 6>I can't even remember your,</v>

1365
01:17:47.201 --> 01:17:50.170
I come here and we talk about like 90 different things and I leave and I'm like,

1366
01:17:50.171 --> 01:17:54.670
what did I even say?
Show man,
I don't even,
I don't even know what I said.

1367
01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.970
Well,

got a hard low woman,
got a few friends.

1371
01:18:25.531 --> 01:18:30.370
I've got a cup of Nas hustles and got no man's soul.

1372
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:36.630
Got a brand new show,
dig me out of this hole.
Got a whole lot of nothing.

1373
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:47.160
Got a one trick pony.
She's

1374
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:56.880
got a brand new staff,

1375
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.780
got a payday slack

Make Khan stops from daughters.

1378
01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.650
Sag Man got a double standard.

1379
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:50.520
I've got a woman's so fan and that's the way that happened.

1380
01:19:50.521 --> 01:19:54.930
I got a part time job,
got a full time hobby.
I get drug,

1381
01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:58.680
get the ball,
fall asleep from lead for the show.

1382
01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.760
You don't have where we I just live with the days

1383
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.640
of vision is blurry.
My head has been climbing.
I got to me,

1384
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.650
she hung up on this side,
got a hole in my heart,
got guilty of stealing,

1385
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:17.340
got a battle as the Jamison.
It's hacky.
Denon got a pill for the pain,

1386
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:22.341
got some trees for the following 25,000 Mau mass be go and I got no way.

1387
01:20:23.121 --> 01:20:24.840
No.
And got new ads,

1388
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:31.560
got the clothes on my back,
got the sound that I'm singing

1389
01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:34.750
the Jama hammering it

1390
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:04.123
down.

1391
01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.660
<v 0>Beautiful.
Good,
good.</v>

1392
01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.710
I'd say sorry that made sense today.
You know what I mean?

1393
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.380
It's one of my favorite songs.
That's fucking bad ass man.
You know,
your,

1394
01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:31.350
your stuff has such a,
uh,
an Everlast feel to it now.

1395
01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:34.710
Like you really nailed your sound,
you know,

1396
01:21:34.711 --> 01:21:37.860
like nobody else could have played that song.
Like,
if I heard that song,

1397
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.590
I would say,
well that's an Everlast song.
That's whatever last song.

1398
01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.130
It sounds like an Everlast song.
Do you know,

1399
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:43.950
it makes it hard to write for other folks.

1400
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:50.490
I got to keep that.
Yeah,
you got it right for yourself,
man.

1401
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:52.230
It's to you,
you know,

1402
01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:57.231
you have this unique blend of having had all these life experiences in health

1403
01:21:57.991 --> 01:22:02.730
problems and being fucked over and be an up and down and man,

1404
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:06.840
it just comes out in your music.
God Damn.
It comes out good.
Thank you man.

1405
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.560
That was a,
that's how does a fat ass fucking style,

1406
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.460
I say like this man since coming here and doing this,
it,
it,
it,
it did two things.

1407
01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:19.320
It made a lot of people who were like me playing acoustically and it also freed

1408
01:22:19.321 --> 01:22:23.490
me up.
Like I,
I've been doing a lot of shows like this now.
Aw Man,

1409
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:27.300
that's beautiful to hear.
Couldn't be happier,
man.
It's been fun.
It's,

1410
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:29.730
I really appreciate that sound.

1411
01:22:29.731 --> 01:22:34.400
I think there's something real intimate about a,
an acoustic set that a,
it's,

1412
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:38.260
I don't want to say it's better,
but it's different.
You know?
For me it's,
it's,

1413
01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:42.270
it's,
it's great because everything starts that way.
If I sit in the room with,

1414
01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.220
you know,
this and maybe a drum machine,

1415
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:46.680
maybe I'll come up with a beat and a guitar line,

1416
01:22:46.681 --> 01:22:49.650
but most of the time it's an acoustic guitar and me,
Oh,
you need man,

1417
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.050
some of the greatest songs ever.
And when the lights go out,

1418
01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:56.940
I'll still be able to do it.
Right.
Exactly.
Yeah.
No,

1419
01:22:56.941 --> 01:22:59.590
it's beautiful,
man.
It's beautiful.
I got to say to Dan,

1420
01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:02.340
Dan at d Armand was listened to us.
Just think I was talking shit about it.

1421
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.410
We just joke about what kinds of crazy shit your cats must've seen.

1422
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.270
<v 2>We like your baby.
We're friends,
we're buddies.
We love you.
We'll never,</v>

1423
01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.520
we're not talking shit about you don't get over sensitive.
That's right.

1424
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:18.340
It's like a comedy based podcast.
I mean she like,
yeah,

1425
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:21.070
but people don't like being talked shit about it and she's just sensitive and

1426
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:22.480
she's been on our show a bunch of times.

1427
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:26.030
I just want them to know if even if I make fun,
it's always,
always with love.

1428
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:30.000
They make fun of me anytime.
Thank you,
sir.
All right,
cool man.

1429
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:32.770
It's really tough to find the angle without coming off like a,
like a dick,

1430
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.250
but some was as nice as you.

1431
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.490
I'm just going to go to the edges have been worn off man,
by this point.
You know,

1432
01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:44.290
in my twenties I was just raging asshole.
Well,
I remember meeting you,

1433
01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:47.950
you know what,
whatever many years ago it was and I was right away.

1434
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.510
You seem like just a normal dude.

1435
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:53.680
You know it's a weird thing when you listen to someone's music and you've known

1436
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:54.730
him for so many years,

1437
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:59.110
like I knew who you were when I was barely getting by.

1438
01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.410
You know when you were playing in my car.
I was driving around.
Jump Up.

1439
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:09.770
You're in my car and shed when you know I was in my worry about at the 20th

1440
01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:15.530
anniversary.
Oh,
that's awesome.
With a bunch of remixes and acoustic fairs,

1441
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:19.990
but you are one of those.
Yeah.
Not going to happen.
Actually,

1442
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:21.280
the funny thing is I was just,

1443
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:25.870
I was just doing an acoustic show and it's like this dude started saying jump

1444
01:24:25.871 --> 01:24:27.950
and then I was like,
I laughed it off at first and then he's like,

1445
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:31.830
I realized he was serious.
I was like,
dude,
it ain't happening.
No dynamite hack.

1446
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.370
The reversion of a Gen Ed.
Kind of cool.
If you could let me tell you something,

1447
01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.510
man.
I been cool.

1448
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:42.511
If somebody else did that jump around is so God damn good.

1449
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:48.270
Then I think it's almost like a disservice if you don't do it.
Even if you don't,

1450
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.250
even if you've got to bring out more equipment,
jump around.

1451
01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:53.470
It's like you can't follow it as no more equipment.

1452
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:57.100
When I show up the one they showed this to me and them since and at most of my

1453
01:24:57.101 --> 01:24:59.170
buddy or another guy on the acoustic guitar,

1454
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.850
it's one of my favorite parts about Marcus Davis is a dude who fought in the
UFC.

1455
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:08.590
It would always come out to jump around those when those bagpipes go off in the

1456
01:25:08.591 --> 01:25:11.710
beginning.
Oh God damn,
that was a good jam.

1457
01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:16.810
It does one,
it's still,
it stays in fuck.
Yeah.

1458
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:20.260
Downloads like I'm amazed.
They're like,
oh yeah,
fuck yeah.

1459
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.960
That's one of the all time greatest workout songs ever,
ever.

1460
01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:27.800
If you lifting weights and you listen to that song that get an extra rapids,

1461
01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.470
it's paying for that car outside.

1462
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.700
I'm sure that's why I need to make that first begins the for vegans so he can do

1463
01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:43.000
it.
Occasionally eat eggs.
They find vegans aren't even allowed to eat eggs,
right?

1464
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:47.230
I don't think so.
No.
That's not crazy.
That's an embryo,
but it's not.

1465
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.230
It's only an embryo if it's been fertilized.
I used to think it was,

1466
01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:53.500
I used to think that every egg could become a chicken potential embryo.

1467
01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.430
Not even if they lay him every day.
Shit,

1468
01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:00.760
they delay the shit out of a main argument.
I'm just saying,

1469
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.740
but I didn't know that it comes out like when it comes out,

1470
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:07.130
there's no way you could ever be a baby.
Like it is just an egg and it's done.

1471
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:10.250
Like even though she laid this egg that is a useless egg,

1472
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.400
it will never be a baby chick.
When is it regular chicks then?

1473
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:14.390
It has to be fertilized.

1474
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:19.520
So they have one every day and a w when a male chicken comes in and lay some

1475
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:24.170
Dick tour,
then there's a baby in that egg.
But until the male chicken does that,

1476
01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:27.110
she's just laying duds.
So if there's no many come along and eat the duds,

1477
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.440
so there's no males around it and it's guaranteed just fucking dugged city.

1478
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.251
Dud City.
Yeah,

1479
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:33.920
and you separate them anyway because otherwise they peck each other's fucking

1480
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:38.210
eyes out.
I was cocky,
a little animals.
Wow.
Wow.

1481
01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:41.910
<v 1>What's a chicken look tastes like that has been fertilized.
Is it even better?</v>

1482
01:26:41.911 --> 01:26:44.940
Is there a name for it?
Like deluxe egg?

1483
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.610
<v 2>Uh,
no,
let's call Balut in the Philippines.
Um,</v>

1484
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:51.820
we used to serve it on fear factor and it was funny because my Phillip waited,

1485
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:56.270
I got halfway big chiclet it's like a duck embryo and it's um,

1486
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.150
it's cooked.
It's a half Co.
Well it's not,

1487
01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:04.070
it's not like solid cooked like,
but it's still like gooey inside.

1488
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.790
But I mean they're eating the bones.
I mean,
you can see the little duck.

1489
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:11.180
I mean we served people this,
but my Filipino friends are like,
oh,

1490
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.890
that's [inaudible] that's my favorite.

1491
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.050
Why don't I go get me on your [inaudible]?

1492
01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.540
The flooding part would have been if like,

1493
01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:21.150
just randomly that happened where one guy was on the show,
he's like,

1494
01:27:21.151 --> 01:27:25.080
oh my grandma used to make that all the time.
Yeah.
What would we would know?

1495
01:27:25.081 --> 01:27:28.990
Horse Penis.
Yes.
We would never see it.
Sort of a Filipino person.

1496
01:27:28.991 --> 01:27:32.410
Balut but we served it to a lot of other people.
It's hilarious.

1497
01:27:32.411 --> 01:27:34.990
Like the thing called a hundred year old eggs.

1498
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.200
It's not really a hundred years old,
but it's a fermented ag.
They,
they,

1499
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:41.500
they dig a hole and they put them in the ground for like weeks or months or some

1500
01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:45.460
shit like that.
The eggs turn black and they have like a jelly,

1501
01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.220
sort of a weird texture to them.
They're fucking disgusting.

1502
01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.060
But people pay money for them.
I think it's inexpensive.
Delicacy somewhere.
Yeah.

1503
01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.510
<v 1>That's what I call tampons at girls.
Forget about,
you know,</v>

1504
01:27:55.511 --> 01:28:00.400
sometimes they pushed like a tampon into far.
I caught a Balut pawn.
It was like,

1505
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:03.160
some girls were like,
I had it in me for four days and started to smell and rod

1506
01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:06.500
<v 2>and I'm like,
that's fucking girls.</v>

1507
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:09.890
Are you hanging out with you get a clean these girls up,
man.

1508
01:28:09.891 --> 01:28:13.460
These girls are lost.
If given up on life days,

1509
01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:16.760
you forgot something was inside you for four days.

1510
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:22.130
I was,
uh,
dating this girl a long time ago and that was fingering her.

1511
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:25.520
And I pulled out a piece of her tampon that she didn't know was in there and she

1512
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:29.170
totally freaked out.
She was so embarrassed.
She was so embarrassed.
She's like,

1513
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.760
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm like,
why?
Why would you be embarrassed?
I'm like,
you,

1514
01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.400
you got,
you know,
you have to put stuff in there.

1515
01:28:34.401 --> 01:28:36.980
So something got stuck at you didn't know.
Why is that embarrassing?

1516
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:40.210
I don't understand why I said marriage is evolved as you Joe.
Wow.

1517
01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.880
I was only 21 I wasn't that involved back then.
Well,
look,

1518
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:46.620
you sounded pretty evolved how you reacted at 20.
I've been,

1519
01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:48.340
I might have been like,
what the fuck is this?

1520
01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:54.240
What the fuck is this?
We're just come from having no baby

1521
01:28:56.170 --> 01:29:00.220
baby though.
You cleaned it and you're like,
what the fuck?

1522
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.030
I mean,
I

1523
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:06.270
<v 6>would've,
I probably would've been a little weirded out by,
yeah.
Yeah.
Was it,</v>

1524
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:10.020
was it,
uh,
just clean or was it like,
yeah,

1525
01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.200
<v 2>Ge,
she'd pulled it out.
No,
it was clean.</v>

1526
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:14.950
She had apparently pulled it out and we'll left a piece of it in there.

1527
01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.790
Broke off,
which was really dangerous for women.
Yeah.
Toxic shock.
Yeah.

1528
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:20.960
I don't know what the fuck that,
I guess it's like,
it's bad.

1529
01:29:20.961 --> 01:29:24.420
Whatever it is to stay.
That's four days of leaving a tampon opinion.

1530
01:29:25.130 --> 01:29:28.160
It's what's going to get you that.
Brian,
how did you tell your friend?

1531
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:32.480
How are you hanging out with Brian?
Word Fuck is wrong.
In junior high school,

1532
01:29:32.481 --> 01:29:37.260
girls were staying at the Fairmont.
It's just Dana DRM on port dean.

1533
01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.890
Dean is a really nice person.
I don't care what she does for a living.

1534
01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.910
She's always been a very pleasant person to be around.
I know.

1535
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:47.980
You know people say like,
Oh,
you're just trying to fuck her.

1536
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:51.670
No one's trying to fuck her.
We're all friends with her.
She's a great person,

1537
01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:55.370
a nice person,
and she's funny,
funny check.
I love her.

1538
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:56.840
So she likes doing gang bangs.

1539
01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.830
Whatevs I missed out podcast right there in my life.

1540
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:04.790
Why don't you guys do a podcast anymore?
We just,
we're just so a horrible,

1541
01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:06.630

1543
01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:11.060
this is a space out and we're just really bad.

1544
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.560
We work weird together.
We're very spacey,
both of us.

1545
01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:19.430
He just shut each other off each other off.
Yeah.
Well,
you're doing too much.

1546
01:30:19.431 --> 01:30:19.971
Anyway,

1547
01:30:19.971 --> 01:30:23.660

1548
01:30:23.661 --> 01:30:25.340
Everlast music.

1549
01:30:25.341 --> 01:30:30.341

1550
01:30:31.281 --> 01:30:35.750

it's good.

1551
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.220
There's a lot of good songs on it.

1552
01:30:37.221 --> 01:30:41.220
I'm not just blowing smoke up your ass and being,
no,

1553
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.190
it's beautiful man.
What else you got for us?

1554
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.430
<v 6>Oh,

I'll play.
It's off.
My last album,</v>

1555
01:30:47.431 --> 01:30:50.750
which actually I started this thing last week and I,
and I,

1556
01:30:50.751 --> 01:30:54.780
and I might have approached it wrong cause I was kind of angry when I did,
uh,

1557
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:59.190
Sony Atv music group or something on Twitter.

1558
01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:00.810
You can find it on my timeline.
These guys,

1559
01:31:00.811 --> 01:31:05.430
like I have an album that I put out in 2008 that's not on iTunes for nobody

1560
01:31:05.431 --> 01:31:08.160
knows the reason why no to,
and it's like I'm trying to get,

1561
01:31:08.161 --> 01:31:10.890
these dudes are changing right now that you'll put this out in mumps called

1562
01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:14.310
loved Warren.
That goes to Whitey Ford.
It's like I did an independent,
like,

1563
01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:18.210
like deal with one of these publishing people and it just,

1564
01:31:18.211 --> 01:31:23.040
it's been kind of like,
how come it's on up?
We got to push this up.
Exactly.

1565
01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:25.450
Yeah.
There's a lot of shit.
It's also the album that has Folsom,

1566
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.460
my Folsom prison cover on it.
Oh really?
Yeah.
It's just,
it's,

1567
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.700
it's purely a red not,
it's not even red tape.

1568
01:31:32.701 --> 01:31:34.880
It's like just motherfuckers just saying aware.

1569
01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:37.110
So like last week I said I'd tweeted like,

1570
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:41.640
hey everybody tweet these assholes about my record.
Uh,
you know,

1571
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:45.510
it needs to be on iTunes.
And like apparently people got pretty nasty quickly,

1572
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:52.050
but I got a response from somebody at the company saying at first they were
like,

1573
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.600
oh that's real professional.
And I wrote him back like real professional.

1574
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:54.901
I was like,

1575
01:31:54.901 --> 01:31:58.470
you guys are fucking me right now cause you don't have a record of mine up that

1576
01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:02.200
I'd put out,
you know,
four years ago.
And then they got back to me.

1577
01:32:02.201 --> 01:32:07.000
So I'm saying respectfully request these people to get my record up on that

1578
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.200
Shit,
man.
That's fucked up.
Cause there's some,

1579
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.470
there's one person in there apparently working on my behalf,

1580
01:32:11.471 --> 01:32:12.730
I can't remember their name at this time.

1581
01:32:12.731 --> 01:32:14.530
So we have an undercover operative in the,

1582
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:18.500
in the opera and the operation at the moment,
you know,
but you know,

1583
01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:21.560
what does it just in competence is it then by the,

1584
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:26.580
by by tribe called quest industry rule 4,080 which is record company.

1585
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:30.250
People Are Shady.
This just is what it is.
That's what it is.

1586
01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:33.490
So the industry,
it's a diet.
I'm going the record up,

1587
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:38.440
but this songs from it and this song I originally wrote when I saw like imagery

1588
01:32:38.441 --> 01:32:43.300
of like kids in Palestine throwing rocks at like,
you know,
Israeli,

1589
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:45.560
like,
you know,
armored cars.
And you know,

1590
01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:50.780
it was Kinda just was like explored the mentality of the oppressed and how far

1591
01:32:51.431 --> 01:32:53.240
you will let yourself be oppressed and

1592
01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:58.150
started to come to the conclusion to songs about a lot more than just that

1593
01:32:58.151 --> 01:33:02.320
though.
It's,
it's about kind of like what could be going on here.
So,

1594
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:05.020
you know what I mean?
So this costs don't in my hand.

1595
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:06.933
<v 8>Oh.</v>

1596

please.
Man.

1616
01:36:52.931 --> 01:36:54.310
When I was listening to that,
I was thinking,

1617
01:36:54.311 --> 01:36:57.650
I need to hear this shit again right away.
Here's a video for,

1618
01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.700
you know what I mean?
No,
I need to get it in my car on the way home,
man.

1619
01:37:00.701 --> 01:37:02.920
I need to figure out how to get it on my phone and get into my car.

1620
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:05.290
I'm going to have to download that shit and I can't get it off iTunes.

1621
01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:10.030
That pisses me off that that bothers me.
Now he is a different version on iTunes.

1622
01:37:10.031 --> 01:37:14.050
Then with the rag,
I'm burdens got drums and shit.
God Damn,
that was good,
dude.

1623
01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:17.780
It's fine.
Ooh,
revolution.

1624
01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:23.500
That's a great song,
man.
That that has,
that has everything.
It has everything,

1625
01:37:23.501 --> 01:37:27.340
man.
That's right.
It's against the fucking,
the beat is fantastic too.
It's a very,

1626
01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.160
uh,
the,
the way you played it.

1627
01:37:29.161 --> 01:37:32.350
It was very unusual sound for like an acoustic song.

1628
01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:35.440
I'll beat up like a drum man.
It's kind of like my thing.

1629
01:37:35.441 --> 01:37:39.850
It's like I was learning,
I was learned.
I was taught and learn.

1630
01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:44.260
I was learning.
I was learning to how to,
how to,
how to,
how to strum the guitar.

1631
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:50.500
I like to cheat this hand like a drum and I down up next to kick and a snare

1632
01:37:50.501 --> 01:37:54.100
kind of way.
My mind works,
you know?
Yeah.
When you were in the,
the,
the,
the,

1633
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.040
the middle of the,
I don't

1634
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.400
<v 0>know any musical terms,
but to me when you were really going at it,
man,</v>

1635
01:37:59.401 --> 01:37:59.910
it was like,

1636
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:04.350
it was both a drum and it was almost like there was a beat to it as well as you

1637
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:08.340
know,
here in the,
the actual sound of the cords.
Okay.
Let's see.
Oh,
it's beautiful.

1638
01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:12.090
Beautiful.
The words are beautiful.
It's so inspiring,
man.

1639
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.400
I have no musical talent at all.
So I always say this,

1640
01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:17.070
like music to me is like magic.
Like you're doing magic.

1641
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:20.490
I quit the fuck you do it.
Like you're making all this crazy awesome noise.

1642
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.361
You know what I mean?

1643
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:25.920
It is to me it's like I'm so musically retarded that it is like a form of magic.

1644
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:30.510
So inspirational man.
It's awesome man.
It's beautiful.

1645
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:34.770
It's beautiful.
Um,
another one I'm playing now.
I'll fuck

1646
01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:38.071
always nice.

1647
01:38:38.071 --> 01:38:40.930
There's another one off that record and I'll just keep it in that theme in
front.

1648
01:38:40.931 --> 01:38:41.764
The moment

1649
01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:58.690
<v 8>it</v>

1650
01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:16.370
<v 11>pickup truck
got Mac</v>

1651
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.863
swimming,

1652
01:40:57.690 --> 01:40:59.210
still got three to go.

1653
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.630
Gotcha.
Broken wing
got mass.

1654
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:18.230
These fucked up.

1655
01:41:32.210 --> 01:41:33.200
Changements

1656
01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:45.510
what's been sad?
Smile.

1657
01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.023
Wow.

1658
01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.153
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.713
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1660
01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:04.470
<v 6>Killing it.
It's called anymore.</v>

1661
01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:13.510
How's it really good?
And that was on the same album?
Yeah.
That song actually.
Uh,

1662
01:43:13.511 --> 01:43:15.450
uh,
uh,
I wrote

1663
01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.340
like the night my father died actually.
Wow.
Oddly enough though,
it's

1664
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.520
other than a reference to him.
It's not that much about him,

1665
01:43:25.521 --> 01:43:28.190
but except for the feeling,
it mean,
you know,
it creates,

1666
01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:33.050
I think for me it's just about fucking everything up.
You know,
every day,

1667
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:38.150
you know,
is that,
uh,
when you,
when you write,
do you try to do that a lot?

1668
01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:43.160
Do you like,
um,
write things that are not necessarily about what you're saying?

1669
01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.550
Yeah,
a lot of times you don't want to like,
you know,
I mean you'll lay out,

1670
01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.140
I'm sure it's the same even within comedy writing.

1671
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:55.580
Lay out a certain amount of yourself within something and,
and,
and,
and,
you know,

1672
01:43:55.581 --> 01:43:59.780
use it in a con and you know,
and in context to make it something else.
Right,

1673
01:43:59.781 --> 01:44:03.230
right.
You know,
it'll,
it'll uh,
it'll be coming,
you know,

1674
01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.540
because the emotion is what we go after.
You're going right.

1675
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:07.010
It's all about emotion.

1676
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.590
So it's like you want to tap into an emotion and it's like,

1677
01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:13.790
I want to recreate that emotion.
I'm going to have to use a piece of it to do it.

1678
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:17.360
But you don't want to necessarily ea trying to tap into it.
Yeah.

1679
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:23.250
<v 0>The music can do,
man,
music is such a weird feeling.
It does tell you like,</v>

1680
01:44:23.251 --> 01:44:27.050
it really like changes the way your whole body feels like it.
Tangle and shit.

1681
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:30.890
I'm really stoned too.
I feel like I'm trapped like in a hypnotized or something.

1682
01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:31.724
Right now.

1683
01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.870
You think somebody could talk you into something that's not as drop,

1684
01:44:36.871 --> 01:44:41.450
change the subject.
Yeah.
Well that's a,
that's a,
one of the things about cannabis,

1685
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.540
cannabis and the connection with music.
You really,
uh,
you know,

1686
01:44:44.541 --> 01:44:48.590
I hate being that person that go,
dude,
you gotta try it.
You got to try it.

1687
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:50.810
But if it wasn't for weed,
I really,

1688
01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.890
I think I would be missing out on a lot of the levels of enjoyment that are

1689
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:57.920
possible because there's some levels of enjoyment when you're high.

1690
01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.090
And one of them is listen to music when you're high and you listen to like

1691
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:04.550
comfortably numb,
you know,
you,
you,

1692
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:08.150
you hit some old school pink Floyd when you're high and you hear all the subtle

1693
01:45:08.151 --> 01:45:12.200
nuances to the song he never recognized before and it's just,

1694
01:45:12.201 --> 01:45:14.240
it overcomes you and a wave.

1695
01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.280
<v 6>It's,
it's what I like to refer to as the highest common denominator.
You know,</v>

1696
01:45:18.281 --> 01:45:22.210
it's like when we all hit that intelligent moment of like not too,
you know,

1697
01:45:22.211 --> 01:45:27.030
there's a lot of music that caters straightly to base nature and base.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1698
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:31.030
And then there's that music that like really inspires to do what we're talking

1699
01:45:31.031 --> 01:45:32.500
about.
Like find that emotion,

1700
01:45:32.501 --> 01:45:36.310
find that thing and really accurately describe it somehow.

1701
01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.480
Or the next person says fuck me too.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1702
01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:43.060
How did you know that about me?
How did you,

1703
01:45:43.090 --> 01:45:44.830
how did you know how to say that about me?

1704
01:45:44.831 --> 01:45:47.860
Like when you do that in a song or a joke,
you know,

1705
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:51.100
I mean half the reason the real belly laughs come from other fuckers are like,

1706
01:45:51.130 --> 01:45:55.780
oh,
I know exactly what he's talking about.
He's so fucking write about

1707
01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:00.110
<v 0>you hit some certain lyrics and people just go,
oh,
that's my fucking song.</v>

1708
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.360
That's my song.
He's playing my song.

1709
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:04.700
There's certain songs that become your song man.

1710
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.960
Like you just want to hear the [inaudible].
They give you a feeling,
you know?

1711
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:09.290
I mean,

1712
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:14.290
I can remember being a kid like right out of high school and I was at a friend

1713
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:19.160
of mine's house and a is having a little backyard party.
Everybody was laughing.

1714
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:20.270
Everybody's having a good time.

1715
01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:22.610
It was like life had not gotten too complicated yet.

1716
01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.460
I was still like only 18 and sweet home.

1717
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:29.000
Alabama came out and he had a little boombox and don't,
don't,
don't,

1718
01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.730
don't don't that fuckings

1719
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:35.290
<v 13>song.
Oh Man.
Oh,</v>

1720
01:46:35.291 --> 01:46:36.041
right away.

1721
01:46:36.041 --> 01:46:41.041
It was like we were smiling and laughing and drinking beers and talking shit,

1722
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.490
whatever sounds good.

1723
01:46:58.980 --> 01:46:59.870
<v 11>I don't know the whole song.</v>

1724
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:08.690
<v 2>I don't know.
That was a great gun.
Damn Song.
That's an all time classic.</v>

1725
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.870
I used to do one for snoop.
That was a

1726
01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.110
awesome,
that's hilarious.

1727
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:31.310
You hang out with snoop a lot.

1728
01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:35.530
<v 6>I mean,
I wouldn't say a lot because you know,
lives are lives and he's like dead.</v>

1729
01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.740
One of them dudes that's just,
he's like Dana White,
man,

1730
01:47:38.741 --> 01:47:41.710
I'm fucking wake up in a different place every fucking day of his life.

1731
01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:45.520
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I don't,
I can't,
I mean,
I love traveling and working.

1732
01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.900
There's a limit dude.
I gotta be at home,
I guess driving a car once in a while,

1733
01:47:49.901 --> 01:47:53.290
you know,
hit the hit the olive bar like I'm talking about,
you know,
y'all know.

1734
01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:58.850
<v 2>No Ryan,
we've already discussed this with him being stupid at the Ralphs.</v>

1735
01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:03.860
Yeah.
Ralphs or Gelson's sometimes has a nice foods too.
Yes.

1736
01:48:03.861 --> 01:48:07.730
Damn right.
Green Olives that you read a lot about them.
All about them.

1737
01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:12.170
Do with the kits.
Discussing what?

1738
01:48:12.171 --> 01:48:15.640
Fuck fucking you.
How about a little respect?

1739
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:21.230
Get into them.
It tastes like black licorice vegetables.
Yeah.
I love it.

1740
01:48:21.231 --> 01:48:23.120
Sounds good.
Give me more.
Good for you.

1741
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:26.420
Hard to grow to some places where they really didn't have much nutrients,

1742
01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:28.100
but they're growing these stupid olives.

1743
01:48:28.190 --> 01:48:31.340
Olives grow on the side of a dirty hill with no rain gas.

1744
01:48:31.341 --> 01:48:33.110
All the people in Greece and then the,

1745
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.720
you have to like treat them before you eat them.
Unless your dog,

1746
01:48:35.721 --> 01:48:38.320
my dogs eat them right off the fucking ground.
They're constantly and,

1747
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:42.980
and I'm like,
you creepy bitches.
And then they get diarrhea.
You know,

1748
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:47.590
that doesn't happen to me.
Dogs eating olives,
no diarrhea when you eat olives.

1749
01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.110
Yeah,
yeah,

1750
01:48:48.110 --> 01:48:51.310
but I'm talking about like some shit on the ground when a dog eats all of that

1751
01:48:51.311 --> 01:48:54.260
they found on the ground,
you're not supposed to do that.
What gives you diarrhea?

1752
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:55.663
You've got a problem.
Yeah.

1753
01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:00.390
<v 6>Jimmy direct son
said,</v>

1754
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:03.830
can it be something you're going to store it in the bank for later as well?

1755
01:49:03.831 --> 01:49:07.430
He has two questions for you.
That's what I'm,
and the other one is,

1756
01:49:07.431 --> 01:49:12.100
do you believe in bigfoot
already said who killed biggie already.

1757
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:16.100
We already did that one.
But do you believe in bigfoot is a good one?
Yeah.

1758
01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.090
The funny thing is I just watched an in depth show or one of these things called

1759
01:49:20.091 --> 01:49:20.924
a,

1760
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:25.580
it's like fucking like about this show.

1761
01:49:25.581 --> 01:49:27.660
I'm like his history,
history channel or whatnot.

1762
01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.620
It's all about connecting like the ancient world would like aliens,

1763
01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:34.160
you know what I mean?
And one of their ancient aliens,
is that what it's called?

1764
01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:35.151
And one of them,

1765
01:49:35.151 --> 01:49:40.151
they're trying to say big foot is possibly some kind of hybrid fucking like I

1766
01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.960
bred alien creatures drops you and that he's traveling interdimensionally and

1767
01:49:46.011 --> 01:49:48.190
that's why we're never catching cause he's moving

1768
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.040
<v 2>through portals of time and space that we can't possibly understand.
Well,</v>

1769
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:55.660
could be,
fuck,
let's make a show.
Didn't this Guy Die?

1770
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.590
The guy who like said he perpetrated the whole big foot thing and like they

1771
01:49:59.591 --> 01:50:03.910
found all these like crass and things he made to make floats and what am I wrong

1772
01:50:03.911 --> 01:50:07.750
about that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's,
there's more than one person.
First of all,

1773
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.320
there's been a lot,
but like a big,

1774
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:12.250
I remember a few years ago a guy died and they were like,
he says,

1775
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:14.030
everything was a hoax.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1776
01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:16.960
There's been people that have that checked out after that episode.

1777
01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.160
There have been people that have done hoaxes.
There's no question about it.

1778
01:50:21.161 --> 01:50:24.730
There's been a lot.
But if there's not one guy,
if there have been hoaxes,

1779
01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:28.450
there've been hoaxes all over the fucking country and all over the Pacific

1780
01:50:28.451 --> 01:50:29.284
northwest.

1781
01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:33.730
There's a lot of shit in the Pacific northwest where it's like monkey canyon,

1782
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.360
Ape Creek,
eight bluffs,
it's eight,
a lot of ape shit.

1783
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:41.140
And one of the reasons is because the Pacific north west coast of the United

1784
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.930
States has a long history of bigfoot sightings.

1785
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.590
Is it people are highest fuck and they just see a bear walking on two legs.

1786
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:49.150
It's possible.
Who the fuck knows?

1787
01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.330
Is it possible that there was a big primate that used to live in the woods?

1788
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.670
That's possible to me.
Oh yeah,
that's fine.
I don't,

1789
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:57.010
but I don't say it's impossible.
I'm just saying at this point,

1790
01:50:57.250 --> 01:51:00.340
really all the technology I phones this,

1791
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:02.600
that nobody's caught a flick and the dude,
no,

1792
01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:06.100
we think that he was gonna Flick and if they do catch a flick it's like,

1793
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:07.360
it's like fucking,

1794
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.930
I just saw something on Yahoo or something just in the last couple of days about

1795
01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:13.930
a guy who says he caught the best picture ever of the loch ness monster.

1796
01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.950
And it was like a little kind of spine.
And even in the article it says,

1797
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:19.420
it looks like it was a manatee or something.

1798
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:23.350
And if the loch ness monster was real,
even if it was a real thing,

1799
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:27.250
it wouldn't fuck with a like a great white shark.
Great White Shark,

1800
01:51:27.251 --> 01:51:31.120
which is a real thing,
is way crazier than this stupid loch ness monster.

1801
01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:34.470
The lochness monster is not killing anybody.
Jack Jack,

1802
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:37.200
they had a shut down the beaches in Santa Barbara and less the ness.

1803
01:51:37.210 --> 01:51:38.140
Is that Dragon Joe?

1804
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:40.930
It would if it the loch ness was a dragon that could actually has like fire,

1805
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.960
like it just,
there's no been no evidence last dragon.
Okay.

1806
01:51:43.961 --> 01:51:46.340
Well what if it was a unicorn?
Okay.

1807
01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.870
But my point is too much of that game of Thrones,
man.

1808
01:51:49.871 --> 01:51:52.910
That's what it's greatest show of all time.
It's up there.
I haven't,

1809
01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:56.650
I haven't tied with,
right.
See,
I only got into breaking band recently,

1810
01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:59.230
like right before this new season started.
Like Danny boy,

1811
01:51:59.231 --> 01:52:00.940
you'd always been trying to tell me.
That's a great show.

1812
01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.190
I got so bored on my last tour traveling.

1813
01:52:03.191 --> 01:52:06.760
I downloaded like all the seasons and they had like a special deal,

1814
01:52:06.761 --> 01:52:09.730
like 30 bucks and you get all four seasons.
I was like,
screw it.
I'll buy it.

1815
01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.860
I started watching it.
I did not stop for like six days watching breaking bad.

1816
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:17.920
I have to get back to it cause I did it from this whole right tattoo.

1817
01:52:17.921 --> 01:52:20.050
My rights leave the whole time I did it.

1818
01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.320
Oh did Aaron Dellavedova grew Tattoo Holla at your boy?

1819
01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:25.430
He a while he was doing it.

1820
01:52:25.431 --> 01:52:29.830
I listened to or watched rather the whole first season I was like God damn this

1821
01:52:29.831 --> 01:52:32.880
is,
it gives better do this and he hasn't.
They haven't let me down yet.

1822
01:52:32.881 --> 01:52:36.850
Like I'm waiting for the like it's,
it's,
it's nice.
It's a good show.

1823
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.230
What is his name?
Bryan Cranston.
Is that his name?
The lead actor?
Yeah,
I think so.

1824
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.200
God Damn that guy.
The dude who plays is the young,

1825
01:52:44.230 --> 01:52:46.100
the younger dude was in one of my videos

1826
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.440
<v 6>many years ago.
White trash.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
It's that dude.
What's his,</v>

1827
01:52:49.530 --> 01:52:51.020
what's his real name?
I forget

1828
01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:54.730
<v 1>Chatham over on the studio the other day.</v>

1829
01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:00.460
I see it with naughty show but at the last second his manager said that he can't

1830
01:53:01.811 --> 01:53:05.970
do it.
So he just had to sit here.
Yeah.
Why does he make,

1831
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:10.150
cause he's in some kind of bullying campaign so he's not allowed to do any adult

1832
01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.720
themed podcast until it like,

1833
01:53:12.730 --> 01:53:15.070
cause it's like for the kids and stuff so he's not going to sound weird.

1834
01:53:15.071 --> 01:53:17.410
Contractor is bullying you have to do with sex.

1835
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:19.760
<v 6>Aaron something or Aaron's.</v>

1836
01:53:19.761 --> 01:53:22.950
Isn't it weird how they like they can decide what your personality should be

1837
01:53:22.951 --> 01:53:25.780
like.
They can decide what you attach.
If the games,

1838
01:53:25.781 --> 01:53:29.710
when he was in one of my videos,
he played a truck driver.
Yeah.
Yeah.
White trash.

1839
01:53:29.711 --> 01:53:31.950
Beautiful.
That's the video.
Oh that's awesome.

1840
01:53:31.951 --> 01:53:34.380
Jesse sniffing fucking math in there dude.

1841
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:42.020
Yeah,
that's a unusual show.
I've heard the wire is really awesome too,
but I know,

1842
01:53:42.850 --> 01:53:47.040
I mean but that show's over,
you know that might be the best cop show ever.

1843
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.113
Never watched it.

1844
01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.300
I got washed like a couple episodes and apparently it gets really good.

1845
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:52.170
I didn't give it a chance.

1846
01:53:52.171 --> 01:53:55.560
The first two seasons I kick off really hard and then they go off into this

1847
01:53:55.561 --> 01:53:57.840
other tangent where they almost lost me at that time.

1848
01:53:57.841 --> 01:54:00.570
Like where they went off to a whole different part of the city and like did it

1849
01:54:00.571 --> 01:54:02.680
hold new store and he kind of like almost,

1850
01:54:02.681 --> 01:54:04.890
it felt like they were scrapping the whole earlier shit,

1851
01:54:04.891 --> 01:54:09.891
but it all kind of comes around into a circle and it was one of the best endings

1852
01:54:11.551 --> 01:54:15.300
I think I've ever seen him.
I won't tell you.
I'm just saying it ends well.

1853
01:54:15.301 --> 01:54:17.970
It like,
it doesn't leave you like,
ah,
it's like,
oh,

1854
01:54:17.971 --> 01:54:21.090
it felt like a complete project.
All right,
I'm going to have to get to it now.

1855
01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.560
Goddammit.
It's good.

1856
01:54:22.590 --> 01:54:27.400
Everybody says you have to wires going to have to get a chance.
Great.
I uh,

1857
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.930
I just loved that they can do shit like what they can do with game of Thrones

1858
01:54:30.931 --> 01:54:31.561
now.
I mean,

1859
01:54:31.561 --> 01:54:36.210
you could make like incredible special effects for a fraction of what it used to

1860
01:54:36.211 --> 01:54:38.640
cost and they can do it with like regular computers now.

1861
01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:42.290
I should Johnny Cash his hand in my video,
not even shake his hand.

1862
01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:45.030
I gave him a pound like Papa.
Really?
Oh yeah.

1863
01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.660
And the Folsom prison video we got probably when I made that song I like,

1864
01:54:48.661 --> 01:54:53.580
you know,
I,
I'm,
I'm like serious about shit.
Can we see that?
I went to,
uh,

1865
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.060
I went to Nashville and met with his son just to be like,
look,

1866
01:54:57.061 --> 01:54:59.160
are y'all cool with this?
Cause I was mixing it with hip hop,

1867
01:54:59.161 --> 01:55:01.620
with the Cypress Hill beat.
Right.
And like on,
on the,

1868
01:55:01.621 --> 01:55:04.410
on the version that's on the record.
So I wanted to be,
you know,

1869
01:55:04.411 --> 01:55:07.710
respectful as I could to,
you know,
Johnny Cash is legacy.

1870
01:55:07.711 --> 01:55:10.710
So I took it to them and I was like,
Yo,
you liked sewing.
Loved it.

1871
01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:14.430
And then when I was thinking of ideas to do the video,

1872
01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:19.140
we came across the stuff that I had known about it,
but I'd forgotten about it.

1873
01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.510
They had just released this DVD box set of the Johnny Cash variety show.

1874
01:55:25.230 --> 01:55:27.000
And so I bought it and started watching it.
I was like,

1875
01:55:27.001 --> 01:55:31.050
how great would it be if I was on the Johnny Cash show and there it was it just

1876
01:55:31.051 --> 01:55:35.850
behind you that
like he had his own,
he had like a variety show and like

1877
01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.440
they let us use the footage,
man.
They liked it.
I mean they,

1878
01:55:40.441 --> 01:55:44.070
that's something they could have easily been like,
hell no,
you can't use

1879
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:47.100
<v 2>that.
They,
I mean,
that's so awesome.
Look at that.</v>

1880
01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:22.280
<v 9>I like the style of the show would use,
you know what I mean?</v>

1881
01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.551
<v 2>It was like,
you know,</v>

1882
01:56:56.551 --> 01:56:59.520
but the point is like you were talking about how cheaply you can do some of this

1883
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:02.940
stuff,
man.
It really didn't cost that much at all because the technology's there,

1884
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:03.960
you know?
Did you,

1885
01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.750
when you have loved to been able to perform for a crowd like that,

1886
01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:08.690
a real crowd like that and just below that,

1887
01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.360
the very end is me and him sitting next to each other and he,

1888
01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.880
and he gives me a pound.
I've always felt like,

1889
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:18.750
what would it be like to be able to go back to the 1950s and do stand up and

1890
01:57:18.751 --> 01:57:21.720
just fucked their brains up sideways?

1891
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:24.780
They would have no idea what you're doing.
They'd be like,

1892
01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:29.460
what is this guy saying?
What?
What are you talking about?
Just cursing.

1893
01:57:29.461 --> 01:57:34.380
You'd be,
yeah.
She imagined going up and that doing that was,

1894
01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:39.120
did you imagine if you did jump around in front of the 1950s cra?
Oh,

1895
01:57:39.121 --> 01:57:43.400
that is awesome.
Oh,
it up.
Do that.
I Dunno.

1896
01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:46.840
I sat next to a dude.
I sat next to a dude and gave him what he was wearing,

1897
01:57:46.841 --> 01:57:50.810
a black jacket and gave him a pound and the next,
and you know is Johnny Cash.

1898
01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.970
Give me a pound back,
man.
That shit was crazy.

1899
01:57:57.610 --> 01:58:00.160
That's cool.
Wow.
That looks good.
And some Forrest Gump.

1900
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.800
What it was,
it was like,

1901
01:58:05.801 --> 01:58:08.080
let's get on some Forrest Gump type shit and that's how amazing.

1902
01:58:08.090 --> 01:58:09.820
Jump onto the old Johnny Cash show.

1903
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:13.310
What do you think I think would happen if you went from a 1950s crowd and did

1904
01:58:13.311 --> 01:58:16.250
jump around,
do you think?
Do you think there'd be able to take a look at it?

1905
01:58:16.251 --> 01:58:20.420
You like you were bat shit crazy man.
Like back in the futures.
No hip hop.
Okay,

1906
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:23.330
so there was no amalgamation of hip hop.
There was no,
what the fuck?

1907
01:58:23.331 --> 01:58:26.810
You guys were doing bagpipes and shit and it was all rowdy.

1908
01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.310
Just look at you like you were working them alien,
I'm sure.

1909
01:58:32.311 --> 01:58:35.240
But they'd be frightened by the sounds that the song made.
First of all,

1910
01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:39.050
if there we'd find that frightening.
Just the way you're barking out the lyrics.

1911
01:58:39.051 --> 01:58:42.130
I'm the cream of the crop and be like,
what the fuck?

1912
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:48.380
<v 4>They didn't know that there was no bragging music back then.
No.</v>

1913
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:50.180
It's like the leader of the pack.

1914
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:56.560
You imagine you come along with jump around.
God Damn.

1915
01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:01.870
It's funny how to culture just sort of evolves and changes and it's hard to

1916
01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:05.770
imagine it ever going back to where it was in the fifties or the clothes they

1917
01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:08.410
wore in the seventies or any of that shit.
So it's never going to happen.

1918
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:12.490
But you could see where back then that was what was up.
That's what was up.

1919
01:59:12.491 --> 01:59:15.040
You could see it all laid out.
You can see it all moving forward.

1920
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:18.060
We're just tired of the old shit.
We need something new,

1921
01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.430
gets more and more complicated.
What a,
what did we live in?

1922
01:59:21.431 --> 01:59:24.430
A fucking weird amaze of humanity,
man.

1923
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:28.070
Human beings are the wackiest motherfuckers of all time.
There's

1924
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:33.340
broken machines out there,
man.
He's no manuals.

1925
01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:39.010
Everybody's gets a Ferrari with no fucking owner's manual or I'll just grind the

1926
01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:43.300
gears are running into the trees,
you know,
it's not,

1927
01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:45.520
we do not figuring out how to use the mind correctly.

1928
01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.950
You've got another one for us.
I got as many as you need,
man.
I've,
I've,
I do this.

1929
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:54.190
I know.
You'd be like,
dude,
I'd be like,
Joe,
you got another joke for me?

1930
01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.790
Um,
what I'm trying to think.

1931
02:00:00.791 --> 02:00:03.160
What's the play here?
Do you do any other kind of covers?

1932
02:00:04.570 --> 02:00:07.560
I can really butcher some bill withers though.

1933
02:00:09.330 --> 02:00:12.220
This is really bad and I bad guitar playing,
but I liked this song.

1934
02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:14.300
I'll play it since you want to cover it now.

1935
02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:19.253
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1936
02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:29.333

fees.

1942

Watch it while no spank him.
File p trap.
No,

1943
02:01:48.810 --> 02:01:51.630
go home and I don't have grandma and them.

1944
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:56.120
When I get to heaven,
our little fog.

1945
02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:57.973
<v 5>Hey,</v>

<v 6>That was awesome shit.
You know,
that's one of my heroes.</v>

1948
02:02:15.610 --> 02:02:17.240
Wow,
that's beautiful man.

1949
02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:23.230
You know you were saying you've know 20th his songs like ain't no sunshine.

1950
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.340
Lovely Day then he's,
to me,
that is the shit bill withers.

1951
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:31.880
You ain't seen it.
You should check out still bill.
Yeah.

1952
02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:35.820
It's a documentary about him.
It's really good.
Is he still alive?
Yeah.
Yeah,

1953
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:39.020
but he don't,
he he,
he has a studio at his house.

1954
02:02:39.021 --> 02:02:41.750
He makes music and lacks it away.
You don't release it?
Nothing dude.

1955
02:02:41.751 --> 02:02:45.080
He just makes music.
Oh Wow.
He just,
he's just on some fuck,

1956
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:47.270
fuck the music business.
Wow.
That's great.

1957
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:50.440
What about all the people that would love to hear it?
I don't know.
I didn't,
I,

1958
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.260
you know,
I got to rewatch it.
But I remember it because I've watched,
you know,

1959
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:55.490
I watched it on the bus where you get high and watch it for a little while

1960
02:02:55.491 --> 02:02:57.200
watching a little while.
But it's like,
you know,

1961
02:02:57.201 --> 02:02:59.390
they taught his daughter's in the business,
you know,
I think he's just,

1962
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:03.860
I mean his songs,
I'm sure his catalog makes a lot of money,
man.
That crazy.

1963
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:05.900
Cause you hear his songs everywhere.

1964
02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:11.080
Every movies that use me song and ain't no sunshine and lovely day and ain't no

1965
02:03:11.421 --> 02:03:13.310
sunshine.
Who is he and what is he to you?

1966
02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.540
A man with pass try to stare me down.

1967
02:03:18.610 --> 02:03:22.940
But when he looked at you,
you at the ground,
you know what I mean?

1968
02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.350
Every woo everywhere.
Grandma's hands.
That's a classic.

1969
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:30.350
He's got a song about a Vietnam veteran called,

1970
02:03:30.351 --> 02:03:34.420
I can't write lefthanded by the guy who lost his leg,
his right arm.
Wow.

1971
02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:39.070
In the war.
And he can write lefthanded crazy deep songs.
I liked that.
Like,

1972
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:42.260
you know,
there's,
there's all the hip hop heroes I have.
And then there's like,

1973
02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:46.640
you know,
cats like bill withers,
Neil Young.
Yeah.
Tom Weights.

1974
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:50.510
Those are the cats like on the songwriting side of things that,
you know,

1975
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:54.470
tickle my fancy.
Yeah.
Neil young has written some pretty intense lyrics.

1976
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:56.780
I was a,
he's a good dude.

1977
02:03:56.870 --> 02:04:01.310
I was working at a concert venue when Neil young was playing there and a riot

1978
02:04:01.311 --> 02:04:05.360
broke out.
They had a shut the show down.
Oh Man.
Yeah.
It was in the 80s.

1979
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:11.390
There was a,
a lawn area.
It was called Great Woods and Mansfield,
Massachusetts,

1980
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:14.210
I think.
I know.
Great Woods.
And uh,
there's uh,

1981
02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:18.710
the area that's like covered by like a structure.
Yeah.
Called them sheds shed.

1982
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.970
And then there's a back area where it's like the amphitheaters.
Yes.

1983
02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.100
What they aren't yet.
Yeah.
And the grassy area,
they started fires.

1984
02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:29.470
People are cold and so they,
uh,
they lit things on fire and they stay in,
in the,

1985
02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:32.450
the security came over and told him they got to put the fire out and next thing

1986
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:35.660
you know,
all hell broke loose and it was crazy and they shut the show down.
Wow.

1987
02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:39.270
Fuck if people,
they were lighting the fires,
they were like,

1988
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:42.630
let's just start a bonfire,
you know,
here in the lawn.

1989
02:04:42.710 --> 02:04:44.310
And he's always wanting to have the fire,
you know,

1990
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.950
they were just too many people that were fucked up too.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1991
02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:50.430
it was,
it was interesting.
But it was,

1992
02:04:50.431 --> 02:04:53.190
I getting to see him on stage from like really close up.

1993
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:57.210
I was like 19 and I had that Gig is a,

1994
02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.320
it's a weird thing for a young kid to see someone that they've seen like in

1995
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:05.010
movies or on the unheard on a record and then they'll go like right there.

1996
02:05:05.011 --> 02:05:06.180
Like he's the right there.

1997
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:11.880
It's a strange thing for young people to really dig new young man.
He's,

1998
02:05:11.881 --> 02:05:13.650
you know,
my father was big on Neil Young,

1999
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:18.060
so like it's one of the things is like when you're young and you hear this music

2000
02:05:18.061 --> 02:05:18.330
and you,

2001
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:22.590
you kind of just rejected on general principle cause it's your parents music,

2002
02:05:22.591 --> 02:05:25.590
right?
Then 20 years later you reexamine it and you're like,
wow man,

2003
02:05:25.591 --> 02:05:28.500
I know all these songs and they're really good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2004
02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:32.160
That's kind of where all that comes from.
I had a good memory for the music.

2005
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:35.790
Yeah.
There was a lot of songs that I had to go,

2006
02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.430
a lot of music that I had to go back to.
Um,

2007
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.333
what is that?

2008
02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:46.510
<v 4>Listening to the time.
Slowly turning.
Who sings that?</v>

2009
02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:47.390
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2010
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:50.770
<v 4>Gosh.
Show heart ache away.</v>

2011
02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:52.990
<v 6>Moody,
Blues,
Moody,
Blues.</v>

2012
02:05:53.050 --> 02:05:55.930
My parents had that and I fucking didn't like it because my stepfather was

2013
02:05:55.931 --> 02:05:58.960
always playing it.
I'm like,
the Shit's annoying.
I want to play some kiss.
Right.

2014
02:05:58.990 --> 02:06:03.580
I couldn't get into it.
I was like,
that's his old man whacked music,
you know?
But,

2015
02:06:03.581 --> 02:06:06.080
uh,
as I got older,
I,
I,
you know,

2016
02:06:06.081 --> 02:06:08.770
would listen to like a Moody Blues Song called Mike.
God,

2017
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:13.570
that's a fucking masterpiece.
A holy shit.
Moody Blues don't get any respect.

2018
02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:18.330
Nobody is like,
Oh,
a huge Moody Blues Fan.
Yeah,
that's right.

2019
02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:22.990
It doesn't come up.
Pull that song up.
Just the beginning part of it,
because this,

2020
02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:27.700
this is a,
it's a beautiful song,
man.
And I couldn't,
I couldn't appreciate it.

2021
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:31.900
Um,
story of your eyes.
Is that it?
Don't worry.

2022
02:06:32.650 --> 02:06:36.850
I'm not a big story by story.
The biggest story in your eyes.
Moody Blues.

2023
02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:40.960
I was never a big muddy boots.
It's not even nothing.
I don't like them.

2024
02:06:40.961 --> 02:06:44.650
I honestly,
I,
I barely recognize the song you sang me.

2025
02:06:44.770 --> 02:06:47.610
<v 7>This is,
I bet you heard it.
You've heard this.</v>

2026
02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:58.870
<v 11>I've definitely heard that.
Oh fuck yeah.</v>

2027
02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.360
This is pre internet pitches.

2028
02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.820
Can

2029
02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:24.993
you feel this?

2030
02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:35.710
And I didn't do it all,
man.

2031
02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:39.533
<v 8>Okay.</v>

2032
02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:42.300
<v 2>Hey,
that's,
that's music.
You know what I mean?
I love that.</v>

2033
02:07:42.301 --> 02:07:44.280
You know what I love about that Song,
man?
First of all,

2034
02:07:44.281 --> 02:07:47.790
that dude must've got a mountain of pussy from singing that song.
Right?
I mean,

2035
02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:50.110
I want to fuck,
I'm just,
and I'm a guy.

2036
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:55.020
Years later kind of reminds me also like blue are some blue oyster cult.

2037
02:07:55.850 --> 02:08:00.460
Yeah.
I was never big on,
Oh,
I love that song,
man.
Story in your eyes.
Oh,

2038
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:04.350
ain't one of the reasons why I love it is wired.
Some dudes love old cars,

2039
02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:08.780
you know?
It's not just a song to me.
It's like a little historic ride course.

2040
02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:11.760
Yeah.
When I listen to Jimi Hendrix,
when I listen to Voodoo child,

2041
02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:14.460
it's not a song to me.
It's a historic ride.
I'm going to go,

2042
02:08:14.461 --> 02:08:16.830
I'm gonna go on and on a ride or as a dead man,

2043
02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:21.940
and he's rocking the shit out of my car on the two 10 I'm driving in my car.

2044
02:08:21.941 --> 02:08:25.890
And the dude who's been dead simultaneously transporting you to probably the

2045
02:08:25.891 --> 02:08:30.420
first time in your life where you heard that?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2046
02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:33.570
I always associated one of the reasons why I like classic rock so much.

2047
02:08:33.571 --> 02:08:36.930
It's like that's what I associate with that Leonard Skinner Song while we're all

2048
02:08:36.931 --> 02:08:41.310
at a barbecue,
like right out of high school.
Like party.
Yeah.
It's fun.

2049
02:08:41.311 --> 02:08:42.144
Fun Music.

2050
02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:44.420
<v 15>Absolutely.</v>

2051
02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:46.590
<v 0>Jimi Hendrix man,</v>

2052
02:08:46.591 --> 02:08:51.030
listening to that Shit in 2012 he's dead for decades,

2053
02:08:51.150 --> 02:08:54.660
but all you have to do is find that shit on your thing.
Press play.

2054
02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.800
<v 15>Brown,
Brown,
Brown,
Bold Paul.</v>

2055
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:05.530
<v 2>Oh No.
I don't know.
That's all I used to know it.</v>

2056
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:12.800
I used to know what Jimmy Henderson and I can't for the life of me.

2057
02:09:12.801 --> 02:09:13.634
Can't remember it.

2058
02:09:35.550 --> 02:09:36.383
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

2059
02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:45.060
<v 2>I know a little bit.
Yeah.
That's one of the things,</v>

2060
02:09:45.930 --> 02:09:50.880
one of the things you pull out for like barbecues or beach fire pits and he

2061
02:09:50.881 --> 02:09:52.470
added effect of Your Voice.

2062
02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:56.940
Is there an interesting with dudes like Hendrix is like this certain iconic

2063
02:09:56.941 --> 02:09:57.750
figures.
Yeah,

2064
02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:02.190
<v 0>like James Dean and Hendrix and Morrison,
you know,
there's like,
you know,
they,</v>

2065
02:10:02.191 --> 02:10:02.431
they,

2066
02:10:02.431 --> 02:10:06.390
they had an impact and then there are in the picture forever during the picture

2067
02:10:06.391 --> 02:10:09.450
forever.
You're never getting away from Jimi Hendrix if there's a guitar,

2068
02:10:09.451 --> 02:10:12.750
if someone's talking about guitar,
if you know,
if you want to use a sample,

2069
02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:16.710
one of my favorite songs ever is someone made a mash up of 99 problems with

2070
02:10:16.711 --> 02:10:19.620
Voodoo child.
It's fucking sensational.

2071
02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:24.480
So it's hard to fuck with because you got Jay z,
you know,
singing 99 problems,

2072
02:10:24.481 --> 02:10:25.560
which is a great song.

2073
02:10:25.561 --> 02:10:30.230
And then you got Jimmy Hendrix playing the Voodoo child soundtrack over it.
Oh,

2074
02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:32.453
that dude's,

2075
02:10:32.490 --> 02:10:37.490
but isn't it that certain dudes like there's certain parts of society where if

2076
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:40.280
you,
you have an immense amount of success and then die young,

2077
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:43.310
you're just in your,
in the vernacular forever.
You're,
you're,

2078
02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:45.070
you're one of the characters that guessing,

2079
02:10:45.210 --> 02:10:47.450
but most of the also not just the success

2080
02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.430
<v 6>those people have had.
I mean like,
um,</v>

2081
02:10:51.330 --> 02:10:53.270
there was an impact like,
no,

2082
02:10:53.710 --> 02:10:56.940
nothing sounded like Jimi Hendrix before Jimmy was right.
Because I mean,

2083
02:10:56.941 --> 02:10:59.460
even the guys at the time,
like Clapton and,

2084
02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:04.150
and Keith Richards and all these dudes were like,
jaw dropped.
Like what the eff,

2085
02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:08.930
this dude's ruining it for everybody.
You know,
that kind of thing.
Janis Joplin,

2086
02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:09.210
you know,

2087
02:11:09.210 --> 02:11:14.010
then nobody had seen a white girl saying that with that kind of just angry,

2088
02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:18.780
you know,
they,
there was at that moment,
a lot of,
you know,
what had like,

2089
02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:24.120
that era is like basically nothing.
The only thing new in the last 30 years,

2090
02:11:24.121 --> 02:11:26.580
truly new in music was hip hop.

2091
02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:29.760
And even that was recycled old stuff,

2092
02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:33.150
but it was just the delivery of it that was new.
You know what I mean?

2093
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:36.990
Everything else is,
is a recycling of blues,
music,

2094
02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:40.560
jazz music,
classical music.
It's all recycled.
You know,

2095
02:11:40.561 --> 02:11:43.920
the Beatles did everything classical to,

2096
02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:47.370
there's no trick that's been done at the Beatles.
Pride didn't pull off already.

2097
02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.810
You know,
with only eight tracks at their availability.
Wildcats.

2098
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:55.830
Today I have 5,000 tracks work.
What do you mean when you say tracks?

2099
02:11:55.831 --> 02:11:59.300
Like what did I know what that track in their day like to,

2100
02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:04.360
to have more than eight things like on separate were the quality of recording

2101
02:12:04.411 --> 02:12:08.160
depends a lot of times on how much you can separate the individual instruments

2102
02:12:08.161 --> 02:12:12.360
and deal with their balance and their,
you know,
you know the cues of them and,

2103
02:12:12.450 --> 02:12:16.650
and getting each individual sounding sharp and having what we call a shelf,

2104
02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:20.940
which means all sounds are audible,
but they all occupied different spaces.

2105
02:12:20.970 --> 02:12:21.391
You know what I mean?

2106
02:12:21.391 --> 02:12:25.230
Like each instrument is equal and feels you feel the weight the way they should,

2107
02:12:25.231 --> 02:12:26.400
but they have different shelves.

2108
02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:28.320
So if you looked at it on here with them separately,

2109
02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:30.090
the things that when you were high,

2110
02:12:30.091 --> 02:12:33.300
all of a sudden that you thought were all together that you can find the

2111
02:12:33.301 --> 02:12:34.260
separation in.

2112
02:12:34.530 --> 02:12:39.190
That's from multitrack recording and fucking being able to have those things in.

2113
02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:42.570
Otherwise you had to do everything like and what they call it.
They used to,

2114
02:12:42.571 --> 02:12:46.770
I mean and the Beatles made records with led had orchestrations in the middle of

2115
02:12:46.771 --> 02:12:50.970
them.
I mean so they were like bouncing seven tracks down to one track,

2116
02:12:50.971 --> 02:12:54.930
putting all their like so they were mixing while they were doing other things.

2117
02:12:54.931 --> 02:12:57.930
It's,
it's bananas.
When you think about what they pulled off,

2118
02:12:57.931 --> 02:13:02.931
making records with the technology that was available to them compared to like

2119
02:13:03.451 --> 02:13:06.360
now it would almost be like,
oh that's easy stuff.
Wow.

2120
02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:09.300
Back then it was like you had dad to invent ways to do what they were doing

2121
02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:11.130
literally every day.
Wow.

2122
02:13:11.131 --> 02:13:14.220
See a lot of musicians had to do that with their pedals and effects.

2123
02:13:14.250 --> 02:13:17.940
Jimi Hendrix was always had guy around and him probably told them with things

2124
02:13:17.941 --> 02:13:20.340
like how can we make this pedal sound different or this,
you know,

2125
02:13:20.530 --> 02:13:23.970
cause there was no mass marketed,
you know,

2126
02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:29.040
crybaby pedals and you know all that shit.
People made their own shit basically.

2127
02:13:29.670 --> 02:13:32.130
Wow.
What a crazy,
it's crazy.

2128
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.660
<v 4>When you think about how much it radically changed,
like in the,</v>

2129
02:13:34.661 --> 02:13:38.700
in the 60s when that came along from the 50s like what two different errors,

2130
02:13:38.701 --> 02:13:41.070
I mean have ever been separated by that much change.

2131
02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:42.900
The fifties the sixties I mean that,

2132
02:13:42.901 --> 02:13:46.290
that is a really strange time throughout human history.

2133
02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.490
Drugs came into play,
man.
I'm telling you in a major way.
Fuck yeah,

2134
02:13:50.491 --> 02:13:54.990
that's exactly what Alex and cocaine,
Lsd,
when it was illegal,
no one knew.

2135
02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:56.850
Meanwhile everybody was taken.

2136
02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:00.990
Everyone from Steve Jobs to scientists and professors.

2137
02:14:01.070 --> 02:14:02.570
<v 6>It's changed my life.
I wouldn't be,</v>

2138
02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:06.350
I wouldn't recommend it to somebody like at my stage of life to do it,

2139
02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:11.120
but when I did it,
it benefited me.
Good trips,
bad trips,

2140
02:14:11.121 --> 02:14:14.310
all that shit.
Like made my mind a stronger thing.
Yeah.

2141
02:14:14.570 --> 02:14:17.210
I also have homies that are,
what are the one of the,
you know,

2142
02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:20.260
there was a gang of us and there's also a couple of them that are still kind of

2143
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:24.710
fucked up,
you know,
little off.
But what happened to him?
Oh yeah.
You know,

2144
02:14:24.711 --> 02:14:26.570
back in the day,
he's one,
he's the guy.

2145
02:14:26.571 --> 02:14:28.400
We always call him the guy that never came back.

2146
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:30.200
That's the guy that never came back.

2147
02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:34.700
He stayed pink Floyd at a song about that and the guy,
the original guy.

2148
02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:38.480
<v 4>Yeah.
That's a scary thing.
But I was wondering,
so maybe he's just,</v>

2149
02:14:38.481 --> 02:14:41.090
can't fucking swim.
Get back over here,
bitch.
Yeah.

2150
02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.560
Get your mental swimming together.

2151
02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:45.350
No matter if it's possible that he just gave up.

2152
02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:47.850
<v 6>Well,
some people aren't prepared.
I mean Lsd,
I remember.</v>

2153
02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.610
And if there's any physicists out there or doctors didn't know different,
I,

2154
02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:54.190
I vaguely remember we read about it.

2155
02:14:54.191 --> 02:14:58.600
We were like looked it up and like that basically by the actual l 25 drug that

2156
02:14:58.601 --> 02:15:01.840
you take is gone.
By the time you're getting hallucinations,

2157
02:15:02.110 --> 02:15:06.580
it's like it triggers something in your mind,
like a gland or something in your,

2158
02:15:06.730 --> 02:15:11.260
in your mind that activates basically all the electrical outlets of your mind or

2159
02:15:11.261 --> 02:15:14.170
just kind of,
instead of being shut down,
opens it all up.

2160
02:15:14.171 --> 02:15:17.530
So basically you ain't hallucinate and nothing that's not already in your brain.

2161
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:21.840
You're not making it.
That's acid basically.
Wow.
I didn't know that,

2162
02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:25.420
that I could be wrong,
but I,
you know,
I took a lot of it when I was young,

2163
02:15:25.450 --> 02:15:28.480
but you know,
it was like,
you know,
uh,

2164
02:15:28.810 --> 02:15:32.080
I was also told once it's in comparison like to supposedly,

2165
02:15:32.081 --> 02:15:34.090
and again if this is ignorance that I'm spouting,

2166
02:15:34.091 --> 02:15:38.050
I heard it somewhere else in number repeating it.
So I am ignorant for saying it,

2167
02:15:38.051 --> 02:15:42.130
but I usually have a pretty good sense for what makes sense and what can be
true.

2168
02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:42.940
You know what I mean?

2169
02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:46.570
And then I've heard of swamis that cut the bottom of their tongues so they can

2170
02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:47.770
swallow their tongues.

2171
02:15:48.070 --> 02:15:52.570
And the reason supposedly for that is there was apparently some gland behind you

2172
02:15:52.630 --> 02:15:53.021
like you know,

2173
02:15:53.021 --> 02:15:56.800
behind this area inside your passage where they can reach up with their tongue

2174
02:15:56.801 --> 02:16:00.730
supposedly and touch it.
I just have a blast and it,

2175
02:16:00.731 --> 02:16:04.350
and he creates the same chemical effect,
touch,
hallucinate.

2176
02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:06.320
So they cut their time.
It could be,
I'm,

2177
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:10.390
I apologize for ignorance if it's ignorance,
but a I'm crazy.

2178
02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.030
I've heard you've never,
I've heard of the swamis cutting their tongue.

2179
02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:16.710
Why else would they cut it?
If not to swallow it.
Let's look it up.
That car,

2180
02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:21.580
we got to go Google shit enough.
My brain just takes any information that says,

2181
02:16:21.581 --> 02:16:26.540
I'm going to say that for a podcast one day.
That seems like,
that seems like

2182
02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:30.040
<v 4>thinking you would say when you're tripping.
Different other personality</v>

2183
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.590
<v 6>could be.
That's why I said,
hey,
this might be ignorance.</v>

2184
02:16:32.930 --> 02:16:37.060
I prequalified it so nobody can give me no shit.
That's creepy.
If that's true.

2185
02:16:37.061 --> 02:16:41.190
That's right.
I ain't going to court and swearing on that shit,
but I've,
I've,

2186
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:45.730
I've heard this and read similar things,
but who knows who wrote those things?

2187
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:48.100
You're absolutely right.
I could have been completely high.

2188
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:50.950
I had been reading like the guy next to me scribbling.

2189
02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:54.300
<v 4>Oh God,
this is a toe.
I found a terrible thing.</v>

2190
02:16:54.570 --> 02:16:58.920
It was a tongue cutting ritual that we're women pot cutoff.
Uh,

2191
02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:02.610
their tongue.
They cut off part of their tongue to honor a politician.

2192
02:17:03.130 --> 02:17:03.650
<v 6>Awesome.</v>

2193
02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:07.220
Do you know what I understand is the part of your tongue that keeps it attach

2194
02:17:07.221 --> 02:17:10.530
that little string underneath your tongue is what they cut?

2195
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:11.331
<v 4>No,
this,</v>

2196
02:17:11.331 --> 02:17:16.040
this woman actually had surgery to cut off her fucking a piece of her tongue so

2197
02:17:16.041 --> 02:17:20.390
she couldn't talk.
Awesome.
Wow.
Was there a good reason?

2198
02:17:21.470 --> 02:17:24.910
There's no good reason.
She'd have to be crazy as fuck.
Yeah.

2199
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:27.920
<v 6>It's like that episode of the twilight zone where the guy bets him,</v>

2200
02:17:27.921 --> 02:17:30.920
he can't talk for a year or something and then he like comes in and he's like,

2201
02:17:30.921 --> 02:17:33.740
I got to renege on the bed man.
Okay.
And the guy cut his tongue out.

2202
02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:38.070
<v 4>Oh.
Oh Wow.
This is the,
this,
I shouldn't be reading this.</v>

2203
02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:43.700
This woman was trying to get a job that pays $45,045 a month and she was trying

2204
02:17:44.311 --> 02:17:48.210
to cut her tongue.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Fuck is wrong with me.

2205
02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:53.400
<v 6>Well Swami Swami swelling anytime maybe I hallucinated that whole thing man.</v>

2206
02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:57.930
<v 2>Yeah,
these are all dudes cutting their tongue off cause it sucks.
You know,</v>

2207
02:17:58.590 --> 02:18:02.520
tongue swallowing,
cut his tongue out.
This guy cut his tongue.
Swallowing,
tongue,

2208
02:18:02.521 --> 02:18:04.590
swallowing,
Google that one because

2209
02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:06.780
<v 4>Butthole,
I found that one.</v>

2210
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:10.870
<v 6>Oh is that really something that came up?
He adds butthole to everything</v>

2211
02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:14.590
nowadays.
You know,

2212
02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:18.010
you put a couple of words in there in a whole list of shit comes up.
It's like,

2213
02:18:18.430 --> 02:18:21.310
is this what you were looking for is like some crazy things happening.

2214
02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:23.280
<v 2>Me Magic.
Okay.
So,
okay,</v>

2215
02:18:23.350 --> 02:18:26.530
so now what Swami is attached to a swollen tongue swallowing.

2216
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:30.520
Well a tongue glass eating razorblades.
Let's see,

2217
02:18:33.310 --> 02:18:33.701
I think,

2218
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:37.930
cause I should know if this is true or not use or something cut Tom cutting as

2219
02:18:37.931 --> 02:18:42.490
similar to what you've seen.
The amazing Jonathan Do.
He uses a uh,
no,

2220
02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:46.810
this is different.
This is like a stunt that people do like they call it Swami

2221
02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:51.930
<v 6>and there's an association there.
I'm guaranteeing it.
I believe you.</v>

2222
02:18:51.931 --> 02:18:53.850
And it's not a radical feminist one.

2223
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:58.580
<v 2>Cut your tongue,
swallow it.</v>

2224
02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:04.800
<v 4>This acid is hungry for tongues.
What page of that?</v>

2225
02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:08.980
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm not finding anything there,
but um,</v>

2226
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.300
there is a gland in the middle of your brain called the pineal gland,

2227
02:19:12.301 --> 02:19:13.980
but I don't think you can reach it with your tongue.

2228
02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:17.370
That is the gland that supposedly is the third eye.
That's what they taught me.

2229
02:19:17.550 --> 02:19:21.120
Well that's the Glen I'm referring to and I see,
I mean,
so some of my shit,

2230
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:23.310
I'm telling you.
Yeah,
to close looking,

2231
02:19:23.311 --> 02:19:27.470
keep looking because I'm telling you there's going to be something that I make

2232
02:19:27.471 --> 02:19:28.040
things up

2233
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.210
<v 6>unless they're really good.</v>

2234
02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:30.510
<v 4>Maybe I should hold Swami wrong.</v>

2235
02:19:30.630 --> 02:19:35.400
I Suppose Swami some Alami let's say Swami third eye tongue.

2236
02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:40.890
See the a band.
It should be
third I tongue.

2237
02:19:40.891 --> 02:19:45.150
Swami.
Yeah,
Swami time.
Swami,

2238
02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:48.540
have you ever thought about doing anything other than music?

2239
02:19:48.541 --> 02:19:52.650
Like if you see like Mark Mcgrath hosting some celebrity show Sudan,

2240
02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:54.960
does that make you go with the I wouldn't do that.

2241
02:19:55.330 --> 02:19:59.320
<v 6>No we didn't.
I mean like,
and I know mark,
I've known him a long time man,</v>

2242
02:19:59.321 --> 02:20:01.120
but it makes total sense for a dude like him.

2243
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:03.800
Like his personality is kind of built for those,
you know,
he's one of like,

2244
02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:07.840
I used to something like that.
Do you even you had ever even his,

2245
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.080
even the way he performs in a band is key.
You know,

2246
02:20:11.081 --> 02:20:13.510
it's kind of caters to that kind of entertainment,
you know what I mean?

2247
02:20:13.511 --> 02:20:15.740
It's like very,
he's,
you know,
he's wants to entertain.

2248
02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:19.420
When you see like Justin Timberlake doing movies and you see a lot of rappers

2249
02:20:19.421 --> 02:20:19.901
have done movies,

2250
02:20:19.901 --> 02:20:22.900
do you ever think about doing any acting or the other guys did that a long time

2251
02:20:22.901 --> 02:20:27.430
ago?
It's not my thing.
I think if you're good at it,
do it.
You know what I mean?

2252
02:20:27.431 --> 02:20:29.410
Like,
I mean,
God knows we wouldn't have,
you know,

2253
02:20:29.411 --> 02:20:32.050
Mark Walberg is a pretty good actor,
man.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2254
02:20:32.051 --> 02:20:32.920
It's very good actually.
I mean,

2255
02:20:32.921 --> 02:20:35.980
so we wouldn't have known that by his rap career though.
You know what I mean?

2256
02:20:35.981 --> 02:20:40.360
So go do what makes you feel good,
man.
Tupac was an amazing actor.

2257
02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:44.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just always wanted to know if you would personally,
I'm,
I'm,

2258
02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:49.150
I'm in my,
I was like,
you know,
the older I get,
I think about,
you know,

2259
02:20:49.151 --> 02:20:52.300
maybe you know,
some youngsters and you'll get some produce,

2260
02:20:52.301 --> 02:20:56.380
some younger acts or something.
Yeah,
that'd be great.
That's,
you know,
still music,

2261
02:20:56.920 --> 02:21:00.130
you know?
Yeah.
Right.
Stick with what you love.
Right.

2262
02:21:00.310 --> 02:21:02.920
That doesn't mean bombard me with demos either.
Please.

2263
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:06.340
Oh do you get a lot of that?
Nah,
I called people that people handed.
I don't ever,

2264
02:21:06.450 --> 02:21:10.360
you know,
I mean I try to give things respectful looks.

2265
02:21:10.361 --> 02:21:13.780
If something about it intrigues me,
but if you just start spamming me with shit,

2266
02:21:13.781 --> 02:21:16.480
I just block you.
The worst thing ever is when people want you to read

2267
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:19.700
<v 4>the scripts like pitch.
Do you know how long that takes to read a script?</v>

2268
02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:23.360
So fucking does 110 pages of this bitch.

2269
02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:25.670
You're going to read this whole thing that's a,

2270
02:21:25.671 --> 02:21:28.010
that's like asking me the road down.
If the low down,

2271
02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:30.890
you know I'm not a script reader.
What am I doing here?

2272
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:33.970
The fuck man.
We know.

2273
02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:37.190
What do you want us later swim past the breakers and watched the world die with

2274
02:21:37.191 --> 02:21:38.380
me and with my haircut.

2275
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:42.930
<v 6>Where you're at right now,
right?
You are?
What was that band?</v>

2276
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:46.940
<v 4>I don't know.
Was it everquest?
No,
whatever.</v>

2277
02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:51.320
Cause that band Santa Monica.
Oh everyone clear.
Ever clear?

2278
02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:56.070
You do.
You look like the Everclear guy
but,

2279
02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:59.050
but that dude is like you.
If you had aids with that,

2280
02:21:59.051 --> 02:22:01.970
that that guy having like a similar named at the time.
Like,

2281
02:22:01.971 --> 02:22:06.130
cause it was Kinda like weird that there was all these like ever things you
know,

2282
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:10.820
did you ever beat,
you should threaten that car will ever clearly no rape on him.

2283
02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:13.830
<v 6>It's very famous liquor.
It's weird that they would pick Everclear.</v>

2284
02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:17.660
Is there a name because he's another one evergreen.
Oh really?
Yeah.

2285
02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:19.910
Like I got a call one day speaking to Neil Young,

2286
02:22:19.911 --> 02:22:22.010
we were talking about him earlier.
I got a call one day.
Like my buddy was like,

2287
02:22:22.011 --> 02:22:26.130
Yo man,
you're playing at the forum men with Neil Young.
I was like,
what I am.

2288
02:22:26.131 --> 02:22:27.520
I was like,
Hey,
I'm in home dog.

2289
02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.450
I'm not playing at the forum and Julio and what the hell you're talking about?

2290
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:34.290
Uh,
this was on my laptop and I Google it and there's some band called Evergreen.

2291
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:36.930
I'm like,
this is my friend calling me by the way.
I'm like,

2292
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:41.700
can you fucking read man?
But that was kind of like,
Yo,
they hadn't been,

2293
02:22:41.701 --> 02:22:45.990
I mean I've been around 20 some odd years,
man.
Come on now.
It's weird though.

2294
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:48.390
It's all right.
Cause it is a different name.

2295
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:52.740
[inaudible] stole it from a fucking boxing glove,
man.
I'm going

2296
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:59.010
to write the name was Eric rocks everlasting and then uh,
you know,

2297
02:22:59.011 --> 02:22:59.520
it was like my,

2298
02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:03.930
he rocky was my original like kind of rap name and just kind of short and do one

2299
02:23:03.931 --> 02:23:07.500
day.
I was like Everlast fuck it.
It's amazing how my,

2300
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:10.470
and back then not knowing copyright laws or anything like that,
I was like,

2301
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:12.030
I already got a fucking logo.

2302
02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:16.230
I really kind of thought that I was like 17.
I was like,
yeah,

2303
02:23:16.231 --> 02:23:18.310
I already got a fucking logo.
I'll just steal that though.

2304
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:19.920
I didn't really think about it.

2305
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:22.490
Was there anybody else trying to be never ever last?
No.

2306
02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:25.560
It seems like a good name.
He seems like a name like that.

2307
02:23:25.561 --> 02:23:26.580
Somebody else might want to swipe.

2308
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:31.440
There's like a Dj that calls himself Everlast which really I find funny.
Really?

2309
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:35.340
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait,
why do I feel like I met this dude?
Oh No.
But it's kind of,

2310
02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:38.730
it's kind of a jerk off move.
That's the one that would probably piss me off.

2311
02:23:38.770 --> 02:23:41.160
I like evergreen a Everclear.
Nah,

2312
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:44.460
I feel like Tj Everlast get the fuck off my nut sack man.

2313
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:49.350
Get the fuck off my nut sack man.
That's fucked up.
Yeah,
I met this dude.

2314
02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:52.440
I,
I'm pretty sure I met him and meet him again and give him a little smack.

2315
02:23:52.470 --> 02:23:55.980
Give him a little smack like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
what have you met a dude?
And he's like,

2316
02:23:55.981 --> 02:23:59.580
Yo man,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm a a fro Rogan man.

2317
02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:04.260
I'm a comedian dude.
Gj Everlast music.

2318
02:24:04.261 --> 02:24:09.030
He's on my space when tight that sees on mice,
mice space.

2319
02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:12.870
Dude,
I've even looked at my face.
I'm like six years weird.

2320
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:16.010
My space is still there though.
I still have one on my,

2321
02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.380
but my manager is the only people who even go near probably.

2322
02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:22.740
But how strange it really stop and think about the fact that it's still there

2323
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:27.240
and nobody goes there anymore.
Like what did they do to fuck it up so bad?

2324
02:24:27.241 --> 02:24:30.270
And they kind of set it all off.
It's like,
yeah,
they set it all off.

2325
02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:34.080
They may Dane Cook if it wasn't for my space,
didn't mean my speed was literally,

2326
02:24:34.081 --> 02:24:37.300
there was an article I will never forget it was in people magazine is they're

2327
02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.700
responsible for Tila Tequila.
Oh yeah.
They jumped her fuck off.

2328
02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:44.720
Thank God she's here for us now,
man.

2329
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.560
She had a provider's entertainment and the first female Juggalos whatever.
Yeah,

2330
02:24:49.561 --> 02:24:51.120
it's a,
it's a,

2331
02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:55.650
my space was the shit at one point in time for for clubs like to want to
promote.

2332
02:24:55.651 --> 02:24:58.650
Like we had a Gig,
he would go on my space.
That's how you'd promote your gag.

2333
02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:02.520
Good luck now bitch.
Joey Dee has stopped using it.

2334
02:25:02.521 --> 02:25:06.390
Even when Joey Dee has stopped using my expat to silver because that's how he

2335
02:25:06.391 --> 02:25:09.480
was writing his blogs.
Writing them all on my space.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't,

2336
02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:11.460
I have not literally even looked at it.

2337
02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:15.340
I haven't even thought to look at it and I'm like,
I wonder what,
it's just an,

2338
02:25:15.390 --> 02:25:19.920
it's an ancient thing.
To me it is,
but it's so amazing that it happened so fast.

2339
02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:24.040
It was within a couple of years.
It was,
it was giant.
Everybody was using it and

2340
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.270
<v 1>it was like,
Facebook's better fuck this.
And they just all left my own,</v>

2341
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:31.210
my space.
It's still there.
Wow.

2342
02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.800
That's hilarious dude.
Well,
it's funny is my picture was like,

2343
02:25:35.801 --> 02:25:40.660
I had the same avatar for the longest time and then when I left my space I just

2344
02:25:40.661 --> 02:25:42.610
took myself out of the picture.

2345
02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:45.570
Like I used to be standing in front of this painting right here.
Oh.

2346
02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:47.130
And then I just took it

2347
02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:54.070
<v 6>brides on here,
man.
Jenna Jamison.
Yeah.
It was a strange thing.</v>

2348
02:25:54.071 --> 02:25:58.810
My space,
I don't know where takes off.
Everybody's on it and then it goes away.

2349
02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:04.510
And then Facebook and then Twitter.
The thing about it,

2350
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:06.400
the crazy part is like fucking,

2351
02:26:06.401 --> 02:26:09.280
if you remember like Facebook really wasn't that big man.
Wow.

2352
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:12.880
And then nothing will happen that changes these things like crazy world events

2353
02:26:12.881 --> 02:26:17.350
change these things.
I,
at least this is the my perception of it,
you know,

2354
02:26:17.351 --> 02:26:20.920
which is,
you already heard my swami story so I could be way off fuck off here,

2355
02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:23.260
but like if I remember correctly,

2356
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:27.520
not too many people were messing with Facebook's until that Virginia Tech

2357
02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:28.690
shooting really?

2358
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:32.310
And then like they started the news was like the guy has a Facebook page and

2359
02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:35.560
then it's like all of America.
I mean that's when Facebook was around,

2360
02:26:35.561 --> 02:26:39.820
people were messing with it,
but I'm talking about it didn't go nuts.

2361
02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:41.500
And so after that event

2362
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.240
<v 16>cut to Alex Jones going,</v>

2363
02:26:43.241 --> 02:26:47.980
well what happened was Facebook engineer the shooting,
they got him,

2364
02:26:47.981 --> 02:26:51.820
it was a Manhattan project type event.
It was top,

2365
02:26:51.821 --> 02:26:53.840
top secret and they brought him out to the desert.

2366
02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:54.870
<v 6>I'm not selling you that,</v>

2367
02:26:54.871 --> 02:26:59.340
I'm just selling you that when you hear Facebook 4,000 times on every 24 hour

2368
02:26:59.341 --> 02:27:01.230
news network,
you get curious about it.

2369
02:27:01.231 --> 02:27:05.070
And people started looking and probably wanted to see the fucking disturb

2370
02:27:05.071 --> 02:27:09.300
fuckers page.
Maybe people want to see that kind of shit.
Then Twitter,

2371
02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:11.960
Twitter was on the bubble.
It was,
it was.

2372
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:13.620
I'm not saying these things weren't around.

2373
02:27:13.621 --> 02:27:16.380
I'm talking about when did they crack and go fucking global.

2374
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:20.790
Twitter was the fucking,
these little,
this fucking,
uh,
Arab spring

2375
02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:25.560
<v 1>I heard friends stirs offices was in tower seven like,</v>

2376
02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.040
like the office of Friendster was in tower seven when it went down or were,

2377
02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:30.570
you know,
dude,

2378
02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:36.150
<v 6>yeah man.</v>

2379
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:40.920
I remember finding dudes in the news that like killed that one got by before I

2380
02:27:40.921 --> 02:27:42.450
even knew about that kind of shit.

2381
02:27:42.451 --> 02:27:46.080
Like Friendster was old when I first heard of it.
Yeah,
same here.

2382
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:47.190
It's like compuserve.

2383
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:52.120
<v 1>I remember that.
Yeah.
Do you remember that?
Yeah.
The uh,
I think,
yeah.
Product.</v>

2384
02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.750
Did you ever have an angel fire website?

2385
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:57.170
<v 6>No.
No,
but one of my homies went and like I was,</v>

2386
02:27:57.171 --> 02:27:59.930
he came home in studio and had to grab something out of it is like email or

2387
02:27:59.931 --> 02:28:04.340
something and he fired up America at AOL.
I was like,

2388
02:28:04.341 --> 02:28:07.360
I heard that.
That's exactly what I heard.
You got mail.
I was like,
man,

2389
02:28:07.361 --> 02:28:11.430
it sounded just like that.
I was like,
man,
you're still on America Online.

2390
02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.350
That's crazy,
man.
I mean,
but you know,
says the guy with an earthlink address,

2391
02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:19.210
earthlink,
earthlink.
Dot Net I wonder who was the guy that did the voice for,

2392
02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:20.360
you've got mail.

2393
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:23.600
I whenever it's probably not even a real human is probably cool to date.

2394
02:28:23.601 --> 02:28:26.300
That dude didn't have sex at that dude during the time of the AOL boom.

2395
02:28:26.301 --> 02:28:29.420
He'd probably had some fun things to say in bed.
Did you think he was doing that?

2396
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:31.310
I was just doing that voice everywhere.
That was a shit.

2397
02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:34.370
I'm gonna fuck you in the end.
He was like Max head room.
Yeah.

2398
02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:39.470
Max head room.
Oh look career doing that for a while at a movie off his phone.

2399
02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:42.860
You've got mail,
you've got nail.

2400
02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:45.440
Do you remember when the dude would do something like kill somebody or something

2401
02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:50.080
and you would,
you could go to his myspace page and your point about like,

2402
02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:53.930
that's what like that Virginia Tech Shit did for fun cause it was all college

2403
02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:55.250
and all's they talked about,

2404
02:28:55.251 --> 02:28:57.380
I remember on the news was like the guy wrote his whole,

2405
02:28:57.381 --> 02:29:00.620
like this whole thing on his Facebook page and Facebook page and the logo was up

2406
02:29:00.621 --> 02:29:03.680
and that's when it went big.
Man,
I'm telling you one,
if you're right,

2407
02:29:03.730 --> 02:29:06.500
it makes sense.
Well,
I made sure,
certainly,
certainly helped,

2408
02:29:06.890 --> 02:29:07.701
certainly made people,

2409
02:29:07.701 --> 02:29:10.640
but I think Facebook offered what my space was already offering.

2410
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:13.880
Just they did it way better.
They made it way less clunky.

2411
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:16.760
It's just like they said on the thing too.
It's way more exclusive.
Yeah.

2412
02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:20.470
Well there's no glitter 10 times,
you know,
only 5,000 on it.

2413
02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:23.210
That'd be gotten out of control on my space tour.
It was like,

2414
02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.140
I have 400,000 friends.
Like not even famous people like,
you know what I mean?

2415
02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:31.520
Like regular people that go on up there on these trolls for more friends.
And,
uh,

2416
02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:35.990
it's like,
I don't care.
I don't even look at my Facebook really.
You know,

2417
02:29:35.991 --> 02:29:38.570
I'll be honest,
when I started using my Facebook fan page,

2418
02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:42.050
I post my shows on it and I look at it,
but I don't,

2419
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:46.760
I don't get into a lot of exchanges with people like Dana's philosophy,

2420
02:29:46.761 --> 02:29:48.980
like I was talking and he's like,
man,
you want to be our big on the Twitter.

2421
02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:50.900
Just go at it with some of these fuckers.
I'm like,
man,

2422
02:29:50.901 --> 02:29:54.080
I ain't got the energy for that shape.
Somebody writes some dumb shit to me.

2423
02:29:54.081 --> 02:29:58.160
It's just like easy.
Let me go to your page right here.
Oh,
block.
You buy.
Yeah.

2424
02:29:58.161 --> 02:29:59.540
I don't need that in my life,
man.

2425
02:30:00.050 --> 02:30:04.400
I write blocked and retweet them or retweet to win.
Right.

2426
02:30:04.401 --> 02:30:08.450
Blocked.
It's gotta be funny,
Amy,
to retweet it.
If it's just like stupidity,

2427
02:30:08.451 --> 02:30:10.280
I'm not going to retweet it.
It's funny and it's bad.

2428
02:30:10.281 --> 02:30:13.340
I don't care if it's bad about me.
If it's funny,
I'll be like,
okay,
here you go.

2429
02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:16.280
I will do it.
Because I don't think people realize how stupid,

2430
02:30:16.281 --> 02:30:19.610
what they're riding sounds respond to it.

2431
02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:22.850
But then they just do it just to get it wrong.
I bet you're wrong.
I bet.

2432
02:30:22.851 --> 02:30:25.280
What happens is,
first of all,
I blocked him after I retweet them.

2433
02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:26.330
And then second of all,

2434
02:30:26.331 --> 02:30:31.331
when when you get the negativity back thrown at you by all these people think

2435
02:30:31.821 --> 02:30:33.500
you're an asshole for saying something stupid,

2436
02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:36.350
then you realize what it's like and you're like,

2437
02:30:36.351 --> 02:30:38.720
what the fuck am I doing causing problems in my life for no reason.

2438
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:42.470
I did that to the Sony people and like I felt bad because like some people were

2439
02:30:42.471 --> 02:30:47.060
like,
why is it going to record online bags?
Bitch.
Hey Bitch.

2440
02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:52.000
Hey fuckers.
It's like,
Whoa,
whoa guys.
I'm just trying to get the record up.
Yeah,

2441
02:30:52.090 --> 02:30:54.950
you got to give a very specific instructions on how to attack.

2442
02:30:55.570 --> 02:30:57.350
Can just let them go.
Look down.
I didn't know.

2443
02:30:57.351 --> 02:30:59.180
I kind of called them Douche bags and I was like,

2444
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:02.630
call these assholes until he's Douche bags.
We put my record.
I don't know.

2445
02:31:02.631 --> 02:31:05.970
Well it's my fault.
Yeah,
you started at Man.
Yeah.

2446
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:09.200
So is the industry people man.
And you know,

2447
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:12.530
if you're in the music industry,
in my opinion,

2448
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:17.630
and this goes for anybody working for me,
that falls under this category,

2449
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:18.800
gets the same description.

2450
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:23.370
If you're in the music industry and you don't make music,

2451
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:26.340
produce music,
record music,

2452
02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:28.440
<v 17>or uh,</v>

2453
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:33.200
<v 6>somehow puts your hands on music,</v>

2454
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:37.730
you are Leech and uh,
and uh,
uh,
uh,

2455
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.450
parasite of,
of,
of cat proportions.

2456
02:31:42.470 --> 02:31:46.430
Has it always been like that though?
It's set up,
the game is set up,

2457
02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:50.960
the game is set up.
It's the own.
And not only are you a parasite,

2458
02:31:50.961 --> 02:31:51.970
but you're the only parent.

2459
02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:55.850
If you're in the music business and you don't make music,
you mean,

2460
02:31:55.890 --> 02:31:57.830
then you're living off another one organism.

2461
02:31:57.831 --> 02:32:00.530
So I'm not being even a dick when I call you a parasite.

2462
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:04.940
But I'm saying what makes you the worst kind of parasite is you're the only

2463
02:32:04.941 --> 02:32:09.380
parasite that's figured out how to eat before the host organism

2464
02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:12.590
you day.
Yeah,
I see what you're saying.

2465
02:32:12.650 --> 02:32:16.430
Like they all are getting their money's the complete disproportion and by the

2466
02:32:16.431 --> 02:32:20.360
time it gets to the person who generated all the monies,
in most cases,

2467
02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:22.460
it's nothing.
You know,

2468
02:32:22.461 --> 02:32:26.570
that's why you see some of these sad stories of cats that should have it all and

2469
02:32:26.571 --> 02:32:31.550
don't cause by the time it got to them,
nobody helped him.
First of all,
you know,

2470
02:32:31.551 --> 02:32:33.500
if you're young and somebody hands you a ton of money,

2471
02:32:33.501 --> 02:32:35.150
I mean I'm surprised I'm alive.

2472
02:32:35.151 --> 02:32:37.490
The amount of money they handed me when I was young,
you know what I mean?

2473
02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:39.110
How does it work?
Um,

2474
02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:44.140
without collusion that they keep the rates so high amongst people I've had.

2475
02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.780
I don't know.
It's just cause the only excuse you get is,
is,

2476
02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:52.730
is that's how it's always been done.
Now I don't buy in to people.
I,
I'm,

2477
02:32:52.731 --> 02:32:53.061
you know,

2478
02:32:53.061 --> 02:32:55.580
I'm telling you I've been doing it long enough where I do it the way I want to

2479
02:32:55.581 --> 02:32:57.800
do it.
If I don't.
What were the options when you first started?

2480
02:32:57.801 --> 02:33:01.300
There was no other options.
You said you started before the Internet.
What was it?

2481
02:33:01.340 --> 02:33:05.090
What was it like when you,
we also used to sell records shall your own record.
No,

2482
02:33:05.091 --> 02:33:06.470
no,
no,
no.
I'm just saying in general,

2483
02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:09.260
you moved a lot of units before the Internet.
You know what I mean?

2484
02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:10.440
If you had any kind of,
you know,

2485
02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:13.400
even if it was just so nice to him playing cat videos over there,

2486
02:33:14.390 --> 02:33:18.440
so there was more,
more money period.
Yeah.
Well I mean it's just like,
you know,

2487
02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:22.940
you had to,
if you wanted some music you had to buy it and bootlegging was like,

2488
02:33:22.941 --> 02:33:23.420
you know,

2489
02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:26.780
a guy on the block buys the record and two of his friends gets to the cassette,

2490
02:33:26.781 --> 02:33:27.920
tape it from him.
You know what I mean?

2491
02:33:28.250 --> 02:33:32.090
Right now it's like a guy on the block buys the download and 5,000 goes on some

2492
02:33:32.091 --> 02:33:36.240
site and 5,000 people get a copy of it.
You know what I mean?
That's so,

2493
02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:39.950
you know,
well even distribution is moving to a digital model,

2494
02:33:39.951 --> 02:33:42.660
so it's almost like you don't need that anymore with things like I tell him,

2495
02:33:42.661 --> 02:33:44.900
he still level record in my hands,
don't you know,

2496
02:33:44.901 --> 02:33:48.410
I like to have a CD in my hands and unfolded and look at it and that's just me.

2497
02:33:48.411 --> 02:33:50.690
That's the generation I come from.
Oh yeah.
I listened to,

2498
02:33:50.691 --> 02:33:52.960
I remember when we went to cds,
I missed her albums.

2499
02:33:52.970 --> 02:33:56.600
I used to love album artwork and that was a big part of the record.

2500
02:33:56.601 --> 02:33:59.600
There used to be a grammy category and I don't think it is anymore.

2501
02:33:59.601 --> 02:34:03.260
It used to be best album cover.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They don't even do that anymore.

2502
02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:06.350
I remember,
I remember teaching Sean's big bamboo.
It would open it up.

2503
02:34:06.410 --> 02:34:09.370
It was like a giant rolling paper.
It's fucking true.

2504
02:34:09.371 --> 02:34:13.490
Me Real actually rolled a joint comparable to the size of that paper.

2505
02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:18.190
I believe it.
Yeah.
Smoke.
I think he's still got the road which is like this

2506
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:22.240
<v 0>long and like that fat like in a frame thing and his house.</v>

2507
02:34:22.270 --> 02:34:26.710
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Big Bamboo was a classic.
And there was uh,
the,

2508
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.490
the album cover itself as part of the whole experience.
What do you do?

2509
02:34:30.491 --> 02:34:34.330
Both that and they didn't have music videos though,
you know,
or rarely,
you know,

2510
02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:38.950
you rarely saw any,
any,
anything visual put to the music.
It was,

2511
02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:42.370
music was like a completely audio experience.

2512
02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:47.230
Internet killed the video star did it though.
Cause it Kinda expanded things too,

2513
02:34:47.231 --> 02:34:49.750
man.
It made like an opportunity to like this.

2514
02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:54.070
One of the coolest things about this Gig is being able to have guys like you and

2515
02:34:54.071 --> 02:34:58.420
we have this band,
honey honey came in and play and it's the coolest thing ever.

2516
02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:02.060
It would be like have a three person concert.
Yeah.
You know,

2517
02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:06.310
<v 6>it's fun.
I like I that's,
you know,
I was like,
I gotta bring the guitar.
I know.</v>

2518
02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:07.610
So this is the Internet though.

2519
02:35:07.611 --> 02:35:09.740
This is the same thing that can cause the same thing,
man.

2520
02:35:09.741 --> 02:35:14.210
I'm make a lot of my bread off and go with my,
you know,
my fans are loyal cats.

2521
02:35:14.211 --> 02:35:18.080
They buy my records,
they buy my downloads.
I mean I keep a steady stream.

2522
02:35:18.081 --> 02:35:20.150
You know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not a hater,

2523
02:35:20.151 --> 02:35:22.910
but at the same time you realize it's just changing.

2524
02:35:22.970 --> 02:35:25.730
It's just changing and things are getting weird.
Like,
no,

2525
02:35:25.970 --> 02:35:28.430
it's not that it's changing.
Here's the thing is like

2526
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:34.240
before the Internet,
I,
I guarantee you I was,

2527
02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:36.950
there is no record I would have ever made that wouldn't have moved at least a

2528
02:35:36.951 --> 02:35:40.970
couple hundred thousand units.
Right now on this last record,

2529
02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:43.700
I think I've moved about 50,000 you know what I mean?

2530
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:46.670
That's completely independent.
I don't,
you know,
it's good,
good money.

2531
02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:47.533
I'm not tripping.

2532
02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:51.920
But what I'm saying is you're not going to tell me that those same other hundred

2533
02:35:51.921 --> 02:35:56.720
50 200,000 people ain't checking for me.
Right.
They're getting the record.
Yeah.

2534
02:35:56.770 --> 02:35:59.120
You know what I mean?
I figured for every one you sell,

2535
02:35:59.390 --> 02:36:03.230
four or five people are just taking it.
So you sound like your problem.

2536
02:36:03.350 --> 02:36:06.680
You're selling it on your own,
like out of your own websites.
I said No.
I mean,

2537
02:36:06.681 --> 02:36:11.540
I have a distributor with emi records,
but I owned my own master's.

2538
02:36:11.541 --> 02:36:14.930
I owned my entire label.
I mean,
they just helped me distribute my record.

2539
02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:17.330
So when it's,
when,
when you say they help you distributed,

2540
02:36:17.331 --> 02:36:20.770
that means physical record.
I mean otherwise,
like iTunes and all that I do,

2541
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:23.810
you know,
you don't need even need a distributor anymore.
You just go to them.

2542
02:36:23.810 --> 02:36:24.920
It's available through them.

2543
02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:29.150
So when you say 50,000 you mean 50,000 people bought an actual CD albums.
Yeah,

2544
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:32.660
actual album.
And then there's,
I mean,
but then a lot of people,
there's a,

2545
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.860
I mean I can't even,

2546
02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:36.980
I don't even know the numbers on like people that just come in by individual or

2547
02:36:36.981 --> 02:36:39.160
two or three songs off the record,
you know?
And that's it.

2548
02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:42.350
So that confuses numbers too.
That's kind of cool though.
He could do that.

2549
02:36:42.351 --> 02:36:44.780
I'm not complaining at all,
but don't ever want anybody to get it twisted.

2550
02:36:44.781 --> 02:36:46.880
I live a real good life,
you know?
Like I said,

2551
02:36:46.881 --> 02:36:50.510
I'd like to meet that hedge fund fan superfan and ones that helped me

2552
02:36:50.650 --> 02:36:51.850
<v 0>be super rich.</v>

2553
02:36:51.851 --> 02:36:54.760
Say that it's going to take into place where he's been cloning babies.

2554
02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:58.550
Show you what's up,
you got to keep secrets.
I'm cool with that man.

2555
02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.300
You go with that.

2556
02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:00.133
<v 6>Maybe</v>

2557
02:37:02.270 --> 02:37:06.200
depends on what they do to the babies once they clone him,
I guess.
Yeah.
You know,

2558
02:37:06.270 --> 02:37:08.390
if they're just cloning babies,
I mean like bringing them to,

2559
02:37:08.391 --> 02:37:10.100
they're going to good homes.
I mean,
hey

2560
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:16.030
everlasting in a mansion and the East Hamptons.
What?
Fuck,
where

2561
02:37:16.050 --> 02:37:20.490
<v 0>the fuck do you get this place man
investment that I got.</v>

2562
02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:25.640
There's something crazy about the people that made billions off the internet and

2563
02:37:25.641 --> 02:37:29.510
the beginning,
you know,
when the Internet dotcom boom was taken off,

2564
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:32.810
people sold websites are crazy amounts of money and mark Cuban,

2565
02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:36.890
one of these guys and he's a billionaire from that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2566
02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:41.030
He's managed to stick around though.
So He's,
he's smart.
He's a very nice guy too.

2567
02:37:41.031 --> 02:37:44.450
Very normal guy right down to earth guy.
Remember he was,
um,

2568
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:48.650
he was evolved I think in some fight organization.

2569
02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:51.470
I think maybe he was involved in affliction in some way too.

2570
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:56.540
And he had to HD net year and he put on the name of that reason.
It's access TV.

2571
02:37:56.750 --> 02:38:00.620
Those are the,
it's still his though.
It's partly his,
I think.

2572
02:38:00.621 --> 02:38:04.880
And Brian's see cresses and recorded a show for that channel.

2573
02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:09.740
It is for like a live show showing it a lot too.
Those are great.
Yeah.
They,

2574
02:38:09.890 --> 02:38:11.210
I don't know why they had to change the name.

2575
02:38:11.211 --> 02:38:14.480
I thought HD net was a great name and they're big on the fights man.

2576
02:38:14.481 --> 02:38:17.980
They have the MMA weekly and all that.
So what boss?
I love that show and yeah,

2577
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.890
that's what I was going to say.

2578
02:38:18.891 --> 02:38:22.820
They're the best as far as like one channel that covers all sorts of different

2579
02:38:22.821 --> 02:38:23.481
fighting sports.

2580
02:38:23.481 --> 02:38:28.481
Like they have k one the smallest shows in little towns like really they're

2581
02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:32.720
doing naming me.
Oh yeah,
they'll put on,
did they go to like,
uh,
you know,
uh,

2582
02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:36.650
all these different small organizations at very few people have ever heard of

2583
02:38:36.651 --> 02:38:40.370
and they'll put on those fights and they'll put on all the best kickboxing too.

2584
02:38:40.371 --> 02:38:44.720
It's real hard to get good kickboxing in America.
It's only that access TV.

2585
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:46.820
Nobody else even shows it.
You don't,

2586
02:38:46.821 --> 02:38:51.140
you can't see like the high level Moy Tai and high level kickboxing like k one

2587
02:38:51.141 --> 02:38:53.600
style.
It's the only them,
but the only ones providing it.

2588
02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:55.550
They always showed the dream shows and all that.

2589
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:59.690
That is the one thing when I always tell people if there's one untapped market

2590
02:38:59.691 --> 02:39:02.990
in the sports entertainment world,
it's high level kickboxing.

2591
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:05.750
Somebody has never capitalized on that.

2592
02:39:05.930 --> 02:39:09.050
While boxers are making fucking millions of dollars,

2593
02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:11.600
MMA fighters are making millions of dollars.

2594
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:16.220
These kickboxers are still languishing and these mother fuckers are so exciting,

2595
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:19.220
like real high level Moy Thai kickboxing,

2596
02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:22.250
it has not been exposed to the masses.

2597
02:39:22.251 --> 02:39:24.710
People don't realize how God damn exciting it is due.

2598
02:39:24.711 --> 02:39:28.820
It's kicking each other in the fucking legs and the head and flying elbows and

2599
02:39:28.821 --> 02:39:32.450
knees and shit like that is a crazy,
exciting sport.

2600
02:39:32.451 --> 02:39:34.400
Like Muay Thai is really exciting.

2601
02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:37.370
It's just hasn't been exposed to America correctly.

2602
02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:42.260
It's up a huge moneymaker just waiting to happen of UFC proportions.

2603
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.210
If somebody,
some rich dudes,

2604
02:39:44.211 --> 02:39:48.710
some investment type character had the balls to put together some really high

2605
02:39:48.711 --> 02:39:51.110
level kickboxing and start showing that shit in America,

2606
02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:55.460
they would make mad loot because one of the things that everybody loves about

2607
02:39:55.461 --> 02:39:58.790
the UFC is that anything can happen,
but the other thing,
they love his knockouts,

2608
02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:01.790
people fucking loved knockouts.
They love submissions,

2609
02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.250
but when it comes to like what they would choose,

2610
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:07.130
they choose to rather see somebody to get kicked in the face.
It's clarity.

2611
02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:09.110
It's something crazy about it.

2612
02:40:09.410 --> 02:40:12.320
When a dude just like the Donald Serone fight last weekend,

2613
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:14.970
Donald's right Shawnee head kicks go lard.

2614
02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:19.260
And then as he's Ouab limb comes in with the fucking death blow and Kaos him on

2615
02:40:19.261 --> 02:40:23.280
the way down.
I mean that's what people want to say.
It wasn't mean tremendous,

2616
02:40:23.281 --> 02:40:26.800
tremendous.
That's,
that's not available in kickboxing,
unfortunately.

2617
02:40:26.801 --> 02:40:29.220
You can't hit a dude in the face while he's going down.
You know,

2618
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:31.470
the referee was separate,
so you get a standing eight count,

2619
02:40:31.740 --> 02:40:34.140
which is actually kind of the worst way to fight.

2620
02:40:34.170 --> 02:40:37.320
It's actually like more dangerous to be allowed to recover.
You know,

2621
02:40:37.321 --> 02:40:39.010
it's better for the referee to come over and save.

2622
02:40:39.011 --> 02:40:42.420
You have to do punches you one or two more times than you to sort of get your

2623
02:40:42.421 --> 02:40:46.950
wits back and then get properly k the fuck out,
you know?
But in,

2624
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:50.640
in k one kickboxing and in Moitai,
that's all.
That's all the standup fighting.

2625
02:40:50.641 --> 02:40:53.250
It's all kicking and punching.
It's all the woods.

2626
02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.970
Probably the most important shit or the most,
uh,
exciting shit to watch.

2627
02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:01.590
No one's ever really capitalized on it.
It's weird.
You know,

2628
02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:02.723
you don't give a fuck.

2629
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:07.580
<v 6>I do.
I love kickboxing,
man.
I'm still feeling the effects from earlier,
Diane.</v>

2630
02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:11.180
I've been stuck on stupid for a while though.
That weed is no,

2631
02:41:11.181 --> 02:41:14.340
it's actually sitting here reflecting on the whole Swami thing and I'm like,
man,

2632
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:18.540
I'm just going to get it today over this Swami.
No.
People are gonna be like,

2633
02:41:18.541 --> 02:41:22.080
we can never retarded shit.
Is that cutting her tongue in my brain?
What?

2634
02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:27.030
I hope somebody proves me right as all otherwise,
I'm like,
man,

2635
02:41:27.031 --> 02:41:31.860
that was a good hallucination because deep in like page five of Google,
you know,

2636
02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:35.670
a good hallucination of an explanation though,
man.

2637
02:41:35.970 --> 02:41:40.280
I was thinking of foster I lyric a good hallucination of an explanation.
Yeah.

2638
02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:43.860
Maybe you could just combine them in your head in some strange way.

2639
02:41:43.890 --> 02:41:46.950
I'm sure something like that happens.
If it's not coming up on Google,

2640
02:41:46.951 --> 02:41:50.340
we all know how reliable the Internet is.
I mean,
it's,
everything's on there.

2641
02:41:50.341 --> 02:41:53.370
And how do the beauty of podcasting is that people get to see,

2642
02:41:53.371 --> 02:41:57.300
talk a little shit and not be correct.
It's not edited.
It's like,

2643
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:59.010
this is why I like you.
I don't have like,

2644
02:41:59.011 --> 02:42:04.011
you know a war room like laptop and in my n in front of me.

2645
02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:08.880
Yeah.
This is a manly laptop.
Look at that.
Yo,
man,
that's a Goddamn Shit.
Yo Man.

2646
02:42:08.881 --> 02:42:12.750
I thought she was gonna.
I thought that was a briefcase.
It runs on coal.

2647
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:15.680
Think as a nuclear reactor.
You're in

2648
02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:17.440
<v 0>the center of it.
Yeah.
This is,</v>

2649
02:42:17.470 --> 02:42:20.360
we started using these because they support them and then runs on the board out

2650
02:42:20.361 --> 02:42:23.600
of the innocent.
It's slowly,

2651
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:27.680
slowly tapping into your soul and it's been staring at me for a while,
dude.

2652
02:42:27.681 --> 02:42:31.370
It's isn't it?
The eyeballs are starting to the lady bug.

2653
02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:34.880
It's us in the future is what it is,
man.
That's what the alien is.

2654
02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:36.680
We know that's the future.
That's inevitable.

2655
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:38.210
That's what we're going to look like.
Really.

2656
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:40.880
If we used to look like monkeys and this is what we look like now,
that's next.

2657
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.920
No doubt about it.
The atmosphere is going to road.

2658
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:46.250
So we're going to have big black guys like permanent sunglasses and that's what

2659
02:42:46.251 --> 02:42:47.930
I'm thinking.
Permanent Sunglasses,

2660
02:42:47.931 --> 02:42:49.610
because we're going to deal with a hostile environment.

2661
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:51.980
You're not going to really talk anymore.
So you have a giant head,

2662
02:42:51.981 --> 02:42:53.300
a little tiny slit of a mouth.

2663
02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:56.870
You're probably gonna get all your nutrients through fucking some cream you rub

2664
02:42:56.871 --> 02:42:58.910
on you or something.
It's probably not even going to have to eat anymore.

2665
02:42:59.110 --> 02:43:02.000
They're going to invent orgasm pills.
Your Dick's can shrink away to nothing.

2666
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:05.060
So you'd be like that man in a suit.
It let's skinny thing.

2667
02:43:05.061 --> 02:43:08.210
You don't need your muscles because you're controlling the universe with your

2668
02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:09.044
brain.

2669
02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:13.840
You speaking telekinetically so you don't a language anymore outside of actual

2670
02:43:13.930 --> 02:43:18.280
information.
You can my jobs,
my job is obsolete then.
No,
I'm going to,

2671
02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:22.850
I'm a mentally telepathically sing to you.
Well that's what I think.
Um,

2672
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:26.480
that's why I think the idea of simulation theory is,

2673
02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:31.330
is actually plausible and that simulation theory is like real legit scientist

2674
02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:32.253
have.

2675
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:37.740
They've offered up the possibility that if someday someone created an artificial

2676
02:43:38.081 --> 02:43:38.914
reality,

2677
02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:43.630
some day someone created something that was a controlled,

2678
02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:47.860
it was something generated by a computer,
but it was undetectable from reality.

2679
02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:51.820
It seemed real.
Is it possible that they could get to that level someday?

2680
02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:54.850
And the reality is yes,
yes,
it is possible.

2681
02:43:54.851 --> 02:43:58.480
If the advent of technology and technological innovation keeps moving in the

2682
02:43:58.481 --> 02:44:00.610
same direction,
everything gets better.

2683
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:04.810
So if you look from now to a thousand years from now or a thousand years ago,

2684
02:44:04.990 --> 02:44:07.930
you look at what we're capable of now and extrapolate what a thousand years from

2685
02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:10.750
now,
we're going to be capable artificial realities a given,

2686
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:13.630
it's going to be easy.
So the idea is are we already there?

2687
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:17.690
Are we already in that artificial reality is,
is it possibly matrix?

2688
02:44:17.770 --> 02:44:21.490
Is it possible that these aliens,
this is what we really look like dog,

2689
02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:26.320
but this is whack.
This is a stupid way to live.
Nobody's getting a dick sucked.

2690
02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:30.220
No one's car makes him cool noises.
Nobody could play some badass music.

2691
02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:35.460
Everything is is like evolved in telekinetic and everything is,

2692
02:44:36.401 --> 02:44:38.890
you know,
without sin over that.
But there's no whiskey.

2693
02:44:39.310 --> 02:44:43.900
There's this notion of Tongan,
no one farts on you,
you know,
don't unplug.
Yeah.

2694
02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:49.180
There may be.
This is why,
you know,
our life is so crazy.

2695
02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:53.770
Maybe this is why life is so chaotic and ridiculous and it would seem like the

2696
02:44:53.771 --> 02:44:58.600
type of being with the brain to build something like New York City would have

2697
02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:01.540
everything else completely wrapped up too.
I mean,

2698
02:45:01.541 --> 02:45:05.260
it takes an amazing amount of innovation,

2699
02:45:05.261 --> 02:45:10.261
thinking computation and construction and just just amazing amount of

2700
02:45:11.051 --> 02:45:14.710
sticktuitiveness to build something.
Build something like a New York City.

2701
02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:18.010
You would think an organism that can do that.
Well,
they got everything wired.

2702
02:45:18.250 --> 02:45:21.550
This whole thing is what they've,
they,
they're,
they're from the future.

2703
02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:24.430
They figured out the whole thing.
They look what they can do.

2704
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:27.070
They can do impossible technical tasks.

2705
02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:30.160
Surely socially they would have it all together.

2706
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:35.340
Surely they wouldn't be this crazy mix of hypocritical bullshit and pro fucking

2707
02:45:37.541 --> 02:45:39.850
propaganda on television and nonsense.

2708
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:42.070
There's no way they would be that stupid if they,

2709
02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:45.250
how would they make satellites and B,
that's fucking stupid.
There's no way.

2710
02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:49.480
So the idea is that we are from an evolve time,
but it's boring.

2711
02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:54.520
So we've come here where Shit's fucking crazy and that's what makes it fun.

2712
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:58.570
You could be having me hi tripping on the way home like,
well you know,

2713
02:45:58.571 --> 02:46:00.370
I've gotten shit about us.
One of those,
you know,

2714
02:46:00.371 --> 02:46:04.390
the whole universe could be under your fingernails,
pubic hair.

2715
02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:08.310
The real problem is,
is starting to be substantiated with science when they're,

2716
02:46:08.311 --> 02:46:09.740
they're doing,
you know,

2717
02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:14.800
these string theories guys and these quantum physicists guys where they're doing

2718
02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:19.430
technical computations when they're trying to figure out like the,
the nature of,

2719
02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:22.070
of the,
the actual matter itself.

2720
02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:26.450
One of the things they're finding is they're finding that there's mathematical

2721
02:46:26.451 --> 02:46:28.070
programs to it all.
There's,

2722
02:46:28.071 --> 02:46:32.960
there's things in this life follow mathematical computations.

2723
02:46:32.961 --> 02:46:34.910
They follow like an algorithm.
They fall.

2724
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.240
The FIBONACCI sequence is like the way a person's face looks,

2725
02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:41.930
the way a tree grows.
Branches the way a sunflower seed,

2726
02:46:41.931 --> 02:46:44.900
it's all like mathematics in escapable mathematics.

2727
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:50.060
And then they're finding more code in,
in,
in quantum theory,

2728
02:46:50.061 --> 02:46:51.760
they're finding like the,
the,
the,
the,

2729
02:46:51.761 --> 02:46:54.270
the smaller they're getting as far as like the,

2730
02:46:54.271 --> 02:46:56.960
the smaller things that they're looking at in the universe.

2731
02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:02.030
They're finding mathematical algorithms that you could clearly track like that

2732
02:47:02.031 --> 02:47:04.220
they met,
they've,
they've measured from the 1940.

2733
02:47:04.221 --> 02:47:07.920
It's like they know what they are like,
they know this actual program.
So it's,

2734
02:47:07.970 --> 02:47:12.890
it's,
it's not outside the realm of possibility that this might be an awesome

2735
02:47:12.891 --> 02:47:13.724
simulation.

2736
02:47:16.390 --> 02:47:20.860
<v 4>That might be why it's so much fun.
Maybe.
Is this stuff that happens and you,
you,</v>

2737
02:47:20.861 --> 02:47:24.850
uh,
like get really deep into in the isolation tank?
Yeah,
that's a problem.

2738
02:47:25.270 --> 02:47:28.630
The isolation tank is only about what is real because nothing's real once you

2739
02:47:28.631 --> 02:47:31.030
get in there.
Once you on there for though if you'd done it,

2740
02:47:31.450 --> 02:47:35.200
I've experimented similarly but not full up like,
you know,

2741
02:47:35.201 --> 02:47:39.310
like nighttime in my pool with my ears plugged into my eyes covered.

2742
02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:42.730
That's all growing.
That's all grove and everything.
But you need a real one.

2743
02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:45.070
You need one.
Yeah.
Everybody needs one.

2744
02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:49.150
It's one of the biggest injustices that people that are interested in thinking

2745
02:47:49.151 --> 02:47:51.190
and creating don't have one of these things.

2746
02:47:51.390 --> 02:47:53.350
Cause if you're in the simulated reality,

2747
02:47:53.351 --> 02:47:55.870
you're probably already laying in some sort of liquid.

2748
02:47:55.871 --> 02:47:59.350
So you're bringing yourself back almost to your assets.

2749
02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:03.640
If you're doing that or nothing is real and your,
your,

2750
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:07.720
your consciousness has been downloaded into some sort of a gigantic computer.

2751
02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:11.830
Hmm.
That one's,
there's gotta be some kind of organic matter.
You think so.

2752
02:48:11.930 --> 02:48:15.850
Oh yeah.
Well what if I'm of what if technology is organic?

2753
02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:17.073
What if we just,

2754
02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:20.200
we think of it as in organic because we create it because we create a phone.

2755
02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:21.590
<v 0>What if you look at it?</v>

2756
02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:24.440
What if it's an actual life form that's independent of us,

2757
02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:27.140
but we have this weird symbiotic relationship with it where,

2758
02:48:27.141 --> 02:48:31.190
where are the method that it's evolving through and it is going from being a

2759
02:48:31.191 --> 02:48:34.220
fucking toaster.
Do you remember star Trek shirt on or something?

2760
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:37.910
You're going to start talking about the Borg or something in a minute.

2761
02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:40.920
Well if you really stop and think about it,
we are,

2762
02:48:40.930 --> 02:48:43.430
we're connected to electricity.
We talked about that earlier,

2763
02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.390
but then we just the power,
but we would panic if the power goes out.
I panicked.

2764
02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:50.890
I don't have my phone.
I panic if my car doesn't work.
You're like,
Shit,
you,

2765
02:48:50.990 --> 02:48:53.840
we are already connected to certain aspects of technology.

2766
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:56.090
I leave the house without my phone.
I feel pretty fucking naked.

2767
02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:58.880
I would rather walk out of the house with no shirt on than I would with no
phone.

2768
02:48:59.450 --> 02:49:01.820
You know,
I feel like,
I feel like less of a freak.

2769
02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:03.253
<v 18>Wow.</v>

2770
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:07.040
<v 0>My phone is more important to me than clothes.
Like I need,</v>

2771
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:08.940
I need to be able to talk to people.
Yeah.
It's strange.

2772
02:49:09.150 --> 02:49:11.310
It's not strange from out there in the wild.

2773
02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:14.640
What of my fuck fucking car breaks down?
What am I have to walk to a tow truck?

2774
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:16.560
Where's the tow truck and what direction do I know?

2775
02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:20.040
Do I walk around naked and as people,
come on man,
Hey,
I need that fucking phone.

2776
02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:24.390
Actually in that scenario would have been naked.
It doesn't make any sense.

2777
02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:31.980
It'd be a good time for new song with uh,
we have by way five minutes.
Okay.

2778
02:49:32.430 --> 02:49:34.770
You got a song,
guys got time limits,
Huh?
Well,

2779
02:49:34.771 --> 02:49:38.820
at three hours we turn into a pumpkin.
Yeah,
it's bad for iTunes.

2780
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:42.330
Something happens.
Oh,
no one more for you.
Okay.

2781
02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:46.800
Uh,
do this one's called long time.

2782
02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:51.900
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

2783
02:51:49.810 --> 02:51:54.810
<v 7>[inaudible] [inaudible] swears the older one</v>

2784
02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:06.130
for the,
for the damage

2785
02:52:09.810 --> 02:52:10.920
was faithful.

2786
02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:15.880
Sad,
sad,

2787
02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:21.640
sad sack.

2788
02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:28.120
Spin down since

2789
02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:34.420
it's been lounge.
Same Sabz painful

2790
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:38.980
spin,

2791
02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:44.650
spin lounge,

2792
02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:52.390
downtime.
Since I was grateful.

2793
02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:05.060
<v 2>Dude.
Thank you very much man.
Anytime man,
thank you for coming here.
Anytime you,</v>

2794
02:53:05.061 --> 02:53:07.800
you know you want to come back,
anytime you feel like playing some songs,

2795
02:53:07.801 --> 02:53:12.720
please just Holler at me.
That's what I did.
I said I'm ready.
Let's go.
Yeah,

2796
02:53:12.721 --> 02:53:15.390
it was beautiful,
man.
That's beautiful.
Thank you very much man.

2797
02:53:15.391 --> 02:53:19.050
Very rational phone.
When I first came on this motherfucker,
man,

2798
02:53:19.710 --> 02:53:24.150
I just quit.
My Twitter or guy just started,
restarted after quitting Twitter,
man.

2799
02:53:24.151 --> 02:53:27.900
You know what I mean?
And,
and there's like damn near 30,000 people on it now.

2800
02:53:27.901 --> 02:53:28.530
So you know,

2801
02:53:28.530 --> 02:53:31.380
that's all love from coming and a lot of it coming from your direction,
man.

2802
02:53:31.381 --> 02:53:34.440
So all that well listen man,
that's beautiful.
And every time you're on it,
man,

2803
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:37.950
we appreciate the fuck out of it.
We get a million positive tweets already.

2804
02:53:37.980 --> 02:53:40.620
I'm looking at it right now.
My Twitter's blowing out.
People loved it.

2805
02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:43.230
They had a great fucking time as always.
Oh Gee.

2806
02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:45.470
Everlast can shake me out just to say,
oh yeah,

2807
02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:48.260
I got a bone to pick with you on your fans.
We have,
oh,

2808
02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:50.430
some mother fucking pictures on Instagram dog,
Nigga.

2809
02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:54.180
There's one and it's a minute.
I don't understand that.
Instagram,

2810
02:53:54.181 --> 02:53:57.360
everybody is like really into his pictures outside of like Twitter picture.

2811
02:53:57.361 --> 02:54:01.320
I don't get it.
I'll try to use it.
I'll try it.
You just set it up so it,
it's you.

2812
02:54:01.350 --> 02:54:04.520
When you,
when you,
when you put it on Instagram,
you hit one button and it'll,

2813
02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:07.690
it'll,
it'll go right to your Twitter.
Okay.
I'll hook it up there.

2814
02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:11.280
They're mad at you,

02:54:15.091 --> 02:54:18.540
You got one and there's like 30,000 people.
All right.
I'll put some more,

Ever last fall.
I'm on Twitter.

2819

I think Kenya,

2825
02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:53.590
can you turn him into cds or you can burn it to a CD,
right?
Yeah,
it is encrypted,

2826
02:54:53.591 --> 02:54:57.400
but you PR,
you can burn it to a CD.
Ken Burns and you did.
Okay.
I believe that's,

2827
02:54:57.401 --> 02:55:01.240
I mean I haven't done that in awhile,
but in these audible,
yeah,
