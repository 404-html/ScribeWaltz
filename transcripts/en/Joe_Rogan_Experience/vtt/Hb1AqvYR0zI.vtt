119
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.074
<v Speaker 2>About sex robots really have come far </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are people who fall in </v>

120
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 2>love with these sex robots and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking taxi driver,</v>

121
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Johnny on the spot from total recall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

122
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy like animatronic chucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese,</v>

123
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:40.564
<v Speaker 2>bass player was kind of get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it can totally mimic you and he's </v>

124
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>going to get to a point where it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like blade runner,</v>

125
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.563
<v Speaker 2>is that what they are now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one I thought about buying a </v>

126
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 2>dude one to do Jujitsu with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to order clearly.</v>

127
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake and butthole</v>

128
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 3>proportions are perfect because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>doll.</v>

129
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 3>It's Bubba dummy the practice </v>
<v Speaker 3>submissions on,</v>

130
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's super stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this,</v>

131
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 3>but he beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You basically can drill the moves,</v>

132
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the same as drilling and on</v>
<v Speaker 3>an anatomically correct body.</v>

133
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 3>If you had an AMA anatomically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to practice Jujitsu on,</v>

134
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 3>you can get some fucking tight moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't wait,</v>

135
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 3>can't wait til the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're announcing for robot fights,</v>

136
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zero interest.</v>

137
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they live or die,</v>

138
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.233
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing about fighting is that </v>

139
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 3>there's some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic thing at stake.</v>

140
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>You can fuck one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

141
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you can fuck with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

142
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Would you watch two robots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

143
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would if there was like some sort of a</v>

144
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:43.724
<v Speaker 3>program that they were running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to see like what the program </v>

145
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they could do it.</v>

146
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be a jack material.</v>

147
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.463
<v Speaker 3>We completely be fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would probably talk to each other </v>

148
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 3>and numbers and they would both be dudes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would both be.</v>

149
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 3>There was one that they just made a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar.</v>

150
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

151
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 3>this just happened that there's videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

152
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 3>The robot sort of speaking like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>code to each other.</v>

153
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 3>These were like fucking like straight up</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck dolls.</v>

154
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Skynet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

155
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.033
<v Speaker 3>And they would turn them on and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of speaking and would seem </v>

156
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 3>like a code and people were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking out about this.</v>

157
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Speaker 3>They had these computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

159
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.183
<v Speaker 3>There were there were linked together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started communicating to each </v>

160
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 3>other in a language that the coders </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't understand and they shut it off.</v>

161
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.993
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

162
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Just simply tell them plugged in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I heard that my version of it that I</v>

163
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:29.654
<v Speaker 3>just said might be the most spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 3>version sounding but might not be </v>

164
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 3>accurate and that what do they might've </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten is like they might have got stuck</v>

165
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 3>in like a feedback loop and just been </v>
<v Speaker 3>making jibberish.</v>

166
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that too.</v>

167
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.163
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's confirmed way too fucking </v>

168
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 3>stupid to know who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just hope it's that second one.</v>

169
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 3>The first one I just want sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening scene in terminator,</v>

170
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 3>but at the same terms as the solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>

171
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.950
<v Speaker 3>don't plug that in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again man,</v>

172
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.263
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a podcast with Sam Harris </v>

173
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:10.271
<v Speaker 3>about it and he is terrified of ai and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's far smarter than me.</v>

174
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 3>So whenever I talked to him about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

175
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

176
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 3>And he's terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrified.</v>

177
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:15.764
<v Speaker 3>That's what freaks me out is when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>way smarter than me are terrified about </v>

178
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:18.681
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

179
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:19.514
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

180
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Eli muskets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrified Stephen Hawkins,</v>

181
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Stephen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

182
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.661
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

183
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:23.841
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

184
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 3>this is going bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

185
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're too close to it,</v>

186
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.773
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like some people also get too </v>

187
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 3>bogged down to the details when you live</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life very ignorantly,</v>

188
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 3>like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no fear of AI technology guy.</v>

189
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.064
<v Speaker 3>So I'll be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just self driving tesla already kill </v>

190
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>somebody or just self driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taxi rower.</v>

191
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.753
<v Speaker 3>She did something very reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She walked right into traffic and she </v>

192
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 3>might've been homeless lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might've been on drugs.</v>

193
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not exactly sure.</v>

194
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the results of the autopsy</v>
<v Speaker 3>route yet.</v>

195
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watched the video,</v>

196
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>she basically just walks right in</v>

197
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 4>front of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The car is going down the road.</v>

198
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 4>So a person driving wouldn't have made </v>
<v Speaker 4>much difference maybe.</v>

199
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

200
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 4>It was hard to tell whether or not you'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to react.</v>

201
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.840
<v Speaker 4>But I guess the technology is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it have,</v>

202
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.763
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology of stopping quick enough </v>

203
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 4>to not hit somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to make it safer?</v>

204
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:13.764
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>

205
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.143
<v Speaker 4>But I think it is right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's more human error when </v>

206
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with people drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed,</v>

207
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to their cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost would rather just trust,</v>

208
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if there's a few deaths per year,</v>

209
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.004
<v Speaker 4>there's way more deaths per year with </v>
<v Speaker 4>just laid out the logic for why the </v>

210
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 4>robots are going to the lady in black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I trust them.</v>

211
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 4>I trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was a black lady.</v>

212
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be fine.</v>

213
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.354
<v Speaker 4>There's another video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just stopping perfectly for a white </v>

214
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:42.561
<v Speaker 4>woman who ran the test needs to reflect </v>
<v Speaker 4>on anything dark in the Mediterranean.</v>

215
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.433
<v Speaker 4>It just fucking run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Tesla stops it all of stops it </v>

216
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Persian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turns out just through science it has</v>

217
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 4>like the same racism of like the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties where they're like,</v>

218
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 4>we'll give the Italians have passed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of you guys.</v>

219
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:02.784
<v Speaker 4>There's two different types of Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 4>is those Oscar de la Hoya Mascot </v>

220
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.383
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other Mexicans that </v>

221
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 4>look like Indian or the mustache starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the edge of the lip.</v>

222
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Where would it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where would it go with them?</v>

223
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

224
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 4>that's what the comment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what Mexico is essentially,</v>

225
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:18.114
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a combination of the native </v>

226
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Americans and Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

227
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 4>And I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the Spanish ones are like,</v>

228
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:24.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

229
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.400
<v Speaker 4>they're the ones who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look down at the locals,</v>

230
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.180
<v Speaker 4>but at this point they're all kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed I think.</v>

231
00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:30.790
<v Speaker 4>But there's still just a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>shape.</v>

232
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 4>That's a real Canelo Alvarez.</v>

233
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

261
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:46.164
<v Speaker 4>If you smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why you would go to the Caribbean and </v>

262
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 4>not just go to Jamaica every single </v>

<v Speaker 5>I've never been.</v>

267
00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.553
<v Speaker 5>Well actually I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was just like a stop on a cruise </v>

268
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 5>and I didn't really thought about doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>a skanks cruise.</v>

269
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

270
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to actually do that.</v>

271
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.010
<v Speaker 5>We do our comedy festival every summer </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we thought about doing your weight.</v>

272
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.083
<v Speaker 5>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the festival was influenced by the </v>

273
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:17.760
<v Speaker 5>cruise because we did these cruises and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is you can't escape the,</v>

274
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bands can't escape the cruise ship.</v>

275
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 5>You're hanging out the whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

276
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.283
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like you're going to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy festivals in 10 different </v>

277
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 5>locations.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So everybody's hanging out and drinking.</v>

282
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 5>We're doing it this year at a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>called Brooklyn bazaar in greenpoint.</v>

283
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.210

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:35.914
<v Speaker 5>middle of the day.</v>

300
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.280

<v Speaker 5>But I think the idea is we're all </v>

303
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be playing this.</v>

305
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.073
<v Speaker 5>like a do Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you come in here and you created an </v>

306
00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 5>environment to play every day and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

307
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 5>that's success today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

308
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 5>Like it to do what you want to do every </v>
<v Speaker 5>single day.</v>

309
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 5>Play with the toys you want to play </v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 5>Hanging out the people you want to play </v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

311
00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 5>And I think everyone thinks like when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have money,</v>

312
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 5>you think when you get money.</v>

313
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:04.210

<v Speaker 5>But then I've watched so many people who</v>

314
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 5>do get money and then they're like,</v>

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.603
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely a minimalist for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the flip phones a decision because </v>

<v Speaker 5>he has to carry around like an extra </v>

<v Speaker 5>people doing it.</v>

349
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 5>And now every time I see people doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

350
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 5>I sort of judged them now.</v>

351
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is true.</v>

352
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:31.964
<v Speaker 5>I mean people live in their cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>every single day and you lose the </v>

353
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 5>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are,</v>

354
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.530
<v Speaker 5>it sends a message like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you dude,</v>

355
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:37.364
<v Speaker 5>this person over here is more important </v>
<v Speaker 5>than the person that's sitting right in </v>

356
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 5>front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

357
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 5>it's just the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

358
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 5>that light is addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's addictive.</v>

359
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Looking at the images,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

360
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 5>you know what happens when a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>sees a TV.</v>

361
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:48.674
<v Speaker 5>You ever see that little kid walks in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>room with a TV and commercials going on </v>

362
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 5>in the kids like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just staring at it because it fucks with</v>

363
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 5>the way you take in like visual </v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

364
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.423
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing like that in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something like a big screen tv </v>

365
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:01.810
<v Speaker 5>in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

366
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Like that image of Super Bowl on a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>screen,</v>

367
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 5>TV and hd and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

368
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 5>You're looking all the green light.</v>

369
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 5>All the guys running around smashing </v>
<v Speaker 5>into each other.</v>

370
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:10.934
<v Speaker 5>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't get that in a real life thing </v>

371
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:15.120
<v Speaker 5>unless you're about to get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:15.963
<v Speaker 5>We'd like to take that serious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we've evolved to like see that and </v>

373
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 5>treat it like a big cat running at you </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>

374
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.010
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is,</v>

375
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.220
<v Speaker 5>but it's on your phone and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching youtube videos like,</v>

376
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.260

<v Speaker 5>Moving around on my phone.</v>

<v Speaker 5>to where my trick pointed out the other </v>

378
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:35.240

<v Speaker 5>if we.</v>

379
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 5>If we ever sit down at a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like don't take food to go and sit down,</v>

380
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.753
<v Speaker 5>how quickly I pull out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're playing family feud so it's </v>

381

<v Speaker 5>my phone,</v>

382

<v Speaker 5>let's do something right.</v>

383
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.010

384

<v Speaker 5>Let's just play family feud.</v>

386
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.010
<v Speaker 5>If you give yourself a day in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you make it even worse.</v>

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.573
<v Speaker 5>And I live in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said we all do and like they sort of </v>

389
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 5>doing like little signs in the subway </v>
<v Speaker 5>that lets you know how long it is before</v>

390
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 5>the subway is going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's pretty.</v>

391
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:08.350
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

392
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.570
<v Speaker 5>when I first moved there in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would just go.</v>

393
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:10.941
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

394
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:13.280
<v Speaker 5>I might be here for 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be here for two minutes.</v>

395
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 5>Who knows when the next subway is going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to come.</v>

396
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 5>But now for subway sign is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't wait on that platform.</v>

397
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:22.220

<v Speaker 5>get a taxi or whatever because I'll lose</v>

398
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:23.054
<v Speaker 5>my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just wondering when that calf is going </v>

399
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:24.944

<v Speaker 5>whereas before you would just chill out </v>

400
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 5>and wait because you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't have the option to.</v>

401
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.590
<v Speaker 5>So now I feel like you have that option </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be on your phone at all times,</v>

402

<v Speaker 5>thing in the world.</v>

427
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.304
<v Speaker 5>I know that actually reads the books </v>
<v Speaker 5>puts in the time in and it's kind of </v>

428
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:41.281
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We say where,</v>

429
00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 5>where people get their news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't really get their news.</v>

430
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 5>They read the headline and then they act</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're getting their fucking news.</v>

431
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.364
<v Speaker 5>They're not putting in the time that </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't reading the books and actually </v>

432
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 5>going and reading a real newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 5>reading you,</v>

433
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that gentleman pisses what pisses me off</v>

434
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:55.794
<v Speaker 5>about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's the only thing where </v>

435
00:18:57.031 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 5>like if you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you don't,</v>

436
00:18:58.981 --> 00:18:59.814
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

437
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 5>if Lewis doesn't watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>basketball@allandj.watches</v>

438
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.473
<v Speaker 5>every single sixers game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's like a thing coming up </v>

439
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 5>where like something about a basketball </v>
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>

440
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 5>Louis won't just start arguing with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

441
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

442
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.703
<v Speaker 5>they need to play this defense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to go into a zone because </v>

443
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:12.631
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

444
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know about that.</v>

445
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.970
<v Speaker 5>But for some reason with politics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

446
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 5>No matter how much anybody's not read </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>

447
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 5>they don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have no problem.</v>

448
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:23.170
<v Speaker 5>Just having a hard core strong opinion </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

449
00:19:23.171 --> 00:19:23.580
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use.</v>

450
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Because I'll see you</v>

451
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.000
<v Speaker 6>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

452
00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 6>So when someone's like super </v>
<v Speaker 6>argumentative about it,</v>

453
00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:29.061
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

454
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:29.894
<v Speaker 6>you're not even well informed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is most of the case with people </v>

455
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:34.790
<v Speaker 6>that are really super aggressive about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

456
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 5>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

457
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Speaker 5>do they have this thing where they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>interviewing people at the fucking march</v>

458
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:40.914
<v Speaker 5>for life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they called it the gun control </v>

459
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.160
<v Speaker 5>march.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How feel just now?</v>

460
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:44.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

461
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 5>they were like all owners in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different cities that we saw it,</v>

462
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:49.350
<v Speaker 5>but it happened at a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>cities.</v>

463
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 5>I think the big ones were in DC and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think there was one out here like that.</v>

464
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.813
<v Speaker 5>There was this guy just interviewing </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and he'd go around and ask them </v>

465
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

466
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 5>if they are for an assault weapons ban </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'd be like,</v>

467
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:00.751
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he'd go,</v>

468
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:01.584
<v Speaker 5>what's an assault weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's amazing how many people just </v>

469
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:05.310
<v Speaker 5>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not even.</v>

470
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Whatever your take on an assault weapon </v>
<v Speaker 5>ban is,</v>

471
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.483
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could you be for banning something </v>

472
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.950
<v Speaker 5>that you can't even define as?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just hold on a second.</v>

473
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

474
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they know that this is what it does.</v>

475
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.693
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

476
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.300
<v Speaker 6>a rifle that shoots people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a semiautomatic.</v>

477
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.350
<v Speaker 6>It's on a hunting gun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So rifle is designed to shoot people,</v>

478
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 6>like in a military situation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what it looks like.</v>

479
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.203
<v Speaker 6>So they're raw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't know what an ar 15 versus an </v>

480
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 6>or whatever versus like what's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's semiautomatic,</v>

481
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:36.780
<v Speaker 6>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll know all the details,</v>

482
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 6>but they do know that these are guns </v>
<v Speaker 6>that kill people with.</v>

483
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.923
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

484
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.853
<v Speaker 5>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like there's like a thing </v>

485
00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:45.160
<v Speaker 5>where there'll be like one for a ban on </v>
<v Speaker 5>semiautomatic weapons,</v>

486
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.780
<v Speaker 5>so you want to ban handguns soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

487
00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:47.960
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want a bad hand guns,</v>

488
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.990
<v Speaker 5>but guns are semiautomatic weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like if you're gonna protest,</v>

489
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 5>read a book on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just having a passive opinion.</v>

490
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:58.670
<v Speaker 5>You're like out marching to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

491
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 5>they want to move the ball down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>field though,</v>

492
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 5>and the more people that come here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have kids,</v>

493
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 5>literally kids that are in the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 5>grade walking out of their classrooms.</v>

494
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 5>They don't fucking know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about or what they're doing.</v>

495
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 5>Their task sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a girl with armpit hair,</v>

496
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 5>you want to fuck me?</v>

497
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 5>That's true or dirty Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harry.</v>

498
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Every tone mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how many of these kids,</v>

499
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.683
<v Speaker 5>this is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many kids are against putting kids </v>

500
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.043
<v Speaker 5>on psychotropic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting kids on unnecessary psychiatric </v>

501
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:30.964
<v Speaker 5>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Parents dope their kids up all the time </v>

502
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 5>because they don't want to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some hyperactive kid.</v>

503
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 5>Some kid has got some fucking power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some energy.</v>

504
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 5>He said I saw the walls on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in.</v>

505
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 5>We were embracing the other day right </v>
<v Speaker 5>before the show we did.</v>

506
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.093
<v Speaker 5>And there was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he must've had autism or or </v>

507
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 5>something or some extreme case of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

508
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.180
<v Speaker 5>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

509
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 5>he was having some sort of violent </v>
<v Speaker 5>episode,</v>

510
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was just a dad,</v>

511
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.863
<v Speaker 5>like calm as day just sitting on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>corner with this kid with the kid face </v>

512
00:21:57.981 --> 00:21:58.814
<v Speaker 5>down as a kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like screaming and shaking and kicking </v>

513
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 5>his arms and legs.</v>

514
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 5>And then I was just holding the kid down</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was so hard to like,</v>

515
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 5>I almost wanted to say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know.</v>

516
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I know they don't ever really tell you </v>
<v Speaker 5>what to do,</v>

517
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on in that situation.</v>

518
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.364
<v Speaker 5>And I kind of watched it for a minute </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it looked like he was abusing </v>

519
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:16.980
<v Speaker 5>the kid for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you kind of realize that like,</v>

520
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.823
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid was gonna like hurt himself or </v>

521
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's like a,</v>

522
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 5>that's like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really hard thing.</v>

523
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

524
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 5>I can accept more in the real extreme </v>
<v Speaker 5>cases where kids have like severe,</v>

525
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 5>severe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>severe problems,</v>

526
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.620
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like they're just happy to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like anyone's like,</v>

527
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.770
<v Speaker 5>hyperactive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just this kind of loose thing.</v>

528
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 5>So no matter all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a one or a zero.</v>

529
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's,</v>

530
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.040
<v Speaker 5>there's varying stages of issues that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids are going to have and some kids are</v>

531
00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:43.390
<v Speaker 5>going to need some kind of medication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're definitely over prescribing.</v>

532
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew my neighbor had a kid.</v>

533
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a fucking kid.</v>

534
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
<v Speaker 5>And they put him on Ritalin or adderall </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a drug man.</v>

535
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.111
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

536
00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:56.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

537
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I give it to my five year old.</v>

538
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.253
<v Speaker 5>We snorted together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If people don't get enough attention or </v>

539
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 5>they don't have an outlet and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what to do with themselves,</v>

540
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:07.683
<v Speaker 5>they get wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean you need to give them </v>

541
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:10.234
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of these people have legitimate </v>

542
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 5>issues and they probably do need </v>
<v Speaker 5>medication and some of these people just</v>

543
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 5>need to find something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting in life.</v>

544
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think what you were saying before</v>

545
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:21.124
<v Speaker 5>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't these kids look into that </v>

546
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:22.624
<v Speaker 5>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of times it's just like </v>

547
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.920
<v Speaker 5>people want the simple thing and got to </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

548
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.390
<v Speaker 5>This is a really difficult question to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get into this stuff.</v>

549
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

550
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:30.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm against guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's easy.</v>

551
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.270
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same thing as when </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are just offended it.</v>

552
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 5>It's like you don't really have to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>read a lot.</v>

553
00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:38.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just easy to be right and you've got</v>

554
00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 5>the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's laziness.</v>

555
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.920
<v Speaker 5>People can just pick a side very easily </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go,</v>

556
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:42.754
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's already defined was on that </v>

557
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:44.351
<v Speaker 5>side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

558
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did my work right,</v>

559
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.303
<v Speaker 7>and it's the same being a parent parent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of parents are really lazy and </v>

560
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you watch it happen when they give their</v>

561
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 7>kid an ipad or I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

562
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.590
<v Speaker 7>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>put them in front of the computer.</v>

563
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 7>That whole thing just happened with Elsa</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gate,</v>

564
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 7>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

565
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.170
<v Speaker 7>borderline hilarious that parents were </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting trolled into their kids watching</v>

566
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.400
<v Speaker 7>really fucked up like cartoon.</v>

567
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of it.</v>

568
00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy.</v>

569
00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:10.560
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about that a bunch of times</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the babies with the broken bottles</v>

570
00:24:10.561 --> 00:24:14.520
<v Speaker 3>over their head up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the same scene play out.</v>

571
00:24:14.521 --> 00:24:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Kids would get drunk whether they were a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

572
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:19.950
<v Speaker 3>mice or kill ducks or they would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

573
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.933
<v Speaker 3>A bottle would go flying through the air</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hit the baby in the head and blood </v>

574
00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:25.800
<v Speaker 3>would be everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a baby's nightmare to.</v>

575
00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Those videos were so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Lynch,</v>

576
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 7>it was a punishment for shitty parents </v>
<v Speaker 7>who weren't watching their kids and what</v>

577
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:36.854
<v Speaker 7>they're putting on their tv because if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you were just paying attention for a </v>

578
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.733
<v Speaker 7>minute you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying right it you have to stop </v>

579
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:43.010
<v Speaker 7>paying attention for a couple of hours </v>
<v Speaker 7>for a kid to get there,</v>

580
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 7>so it was only really shitty parents </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we're dealing with that.</v>

581
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 7>Is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's dude.</v>

582
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:48.824
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was no way to like land on that </v>

583
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 7>just by googling spiderman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That wasn't the first one was coming up.</v>

584
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.830
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would.</v>

585
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 7>I think there were like paying to get in</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a loop of certain videos.</v>

586
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.704
<v Speaker 7>Like it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was obsessed with it for like a week </v>

587
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.453
<v Speaker 7>and I just couldn't stop going on under </v>
<v Speaker 7>that subreddit page and it was freaky </v>

588
00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:04.470
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

589
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 3>They weren't really porn spiderman ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these.</v>

590
00:25:11.921 --> 00:25:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I think they took some of them down but </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

591
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.140
<v Speaker 3>But then it gets to this place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

592
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:17.974
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you taking it down because it's </v>

593
00:25:18.761 --> 00:25:22.000
<v Speaker 3>targeting children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you taking it down because you can't</v>

594
00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:25.990
<v Speaker 3>show cartoon babies getting hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head with bottles because if that's what</v>

595
00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

596
00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:30.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fucking south parks </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not gonna be able to show.</v>

597
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot,</v>

598
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:32.970
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

599
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.030
<v Speaker 3>little show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

600
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.864
<v Speaker 3>Where's the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you think this is creepy and is </v>

601
00:25:37.691 --> 00:25:41.410
<v Speaker 3>luring kids in versus the just the act </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it was a funny,</v>

602
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.570
<v Speaker 3>you know Tim and Eric Sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

603
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 3>And a cartoon baby got hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bottle.</v>

604
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:47.050
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

605
00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:48.640
<v Speaker 3>These guys are nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you'd say.</v>

606
00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.990
<v Speaker 3>But you wouldn't be like saying this has</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be removed off of Youtube.</v>

607
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to see the intention because </v>

608
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.730
<v Speaker 3>you could easily say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well South Park is a cartoon,</v>

609
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that appealing to kids?</v>

610
00:25:58.991 --> 00:25:59.824
<v Speaker 3>But I think to Lewis his point that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution isn't that this shit needs to </v>

611
00:26:02.051 --> 00:26:02.884
<v Speaker 3>be banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The solution is just like let parents </v>

612
00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:09.181
<v Speaker 3>know always the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single time we talk about Louis.</v>

613
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.713
<v Speaker 3>What was the other one we watched?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh father your father with two kids and </v>

614
00:26:13.931 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 3>it's really just creepy issue happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

615
00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:18.970
<v Speaker 3>so this is another one of those like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

616
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.640
<v Speaker 3>The kids are watching that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch it for a second,</v>

617
00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:22.474
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

618
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.990
<v Speaker 7>I pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a dad and his channel,</v>

619
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

620
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.670
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I forget the name of the channel,</v>

621
00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:27.504
<v Speaker 7>but he had his two little girls who were</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably seven and nine years old and </v>

622
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:32.060
<v Speaker 7>they were doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just kind of weird shit dude.</v>

623
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:32.894
<v Speaker 7>They're like eating chocolate bars and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it'd be chocolate all over their face </v>

624
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.643
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'd make weird sounds and they'd </v>

625
00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:39.510
<v Speaker 7>climb up stairs and they'd show it from </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

626
00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 7>behind there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it was very fucking pedophilia cut.</v>

627
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.394
<v Speaker 7>Don't even know</v>

628
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.413
<v Speaker 5>it was fucked up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this guy is channel got taken down </v>

629
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 5>and the guy's like doing interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

630
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:48.811
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>his house with this channel.</v>

633
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they shut the whole channel now.</v>

634
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 5>And what did he say when you interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>

635
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read some thing when it was just kinda</v>

636
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:00.541
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we're trying to get our channel back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

638
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:05.610
<v Speaker 5>he was just like very innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was another thing the same again.</v>

639
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 5>So fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on my own time.</v>

640
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 5>I got to go to Vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

641
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 5>but the same when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff that was mom's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Kmart.</v>

644
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the channel,</v>

645
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:22.554
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm youtube terminates toy freaks </v>

646
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 5>channel amid broader crackdown on </v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbing kids content.</v>

647
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is very,</v>

648
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 5>like what Jay said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very David Lynch type vibe.</v>

649
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.594
<v Speaker 5>Like you feel like you're in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>nightmare world where everyone's just </v>

650
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:40.350
<v Speaker 5>acting not the right human way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That eight point $5 million subscribers,</v>

651
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.443
<v Speaker 5>gold plaques that you have amongst her </v>
<v Speaker 5>top most 100 most viewed channels on </v>

652
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

653
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Either pacifiers in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

654
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking bizarre.</v>

655
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 5>You gotta somehow somehow got to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>level before.</v>

656
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 5>Can we watch some of this and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>show it.</v>

657
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 5>You can't show it on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we watch it?</v>

658
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way we can not see it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're about to get rated.</v>

659
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 5>You get what you figured out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

660
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't know what the problem is.</v>

661
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 5>Whenever we put something on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shouldn't be on youtube,</v>

662
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.693
<v Speaker 5>we get flagged this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like mommy bloggers and they </v>

663
00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:19.464
<v Speaker 5>would like have a video of them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>their daughter going to the supermarket </v>

664
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:22.820
<v Speaker 5>and it'd be like 500 views.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

665
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 5>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

666
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.653
<v Speaker 5>If I was thinking of Youtube flags it so</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one else could see it on another </v>

667
00:28:29.471 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 5>website.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

668
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.103
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

669
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.693
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Louis what?</v>

670
00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.320
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

671
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.153
<v Speaker 5>So then they do another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same mommy blogger would do one </v>

672
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:36.804
<v Speaker 5>called bath time and she's like bathing </v>
<v Speaker 5>her five year old and it's not anything </v>

673
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 5>more than her like sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bathtub.</v>

674
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.253
<v Speaker 5>But those videos were getting millions </v>
<v Speaker 5>of views and then the mom would disable </v>

675
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 5>the comments and turn off the thumbs up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the thumbs downs.</v>

676
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.363
<v Speaker 5>So they were just monetizing pedophiles </v>
<v Speaker 5>jerking off to their daughters in a </v>

677
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 5>bathtub and it was just like a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>subculture that was happening on youtube</v>

678
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.823
<v Speaker 5>that was sort of just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was really talking about it and </v>

679
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 5>they kind of made it go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't even a big deal.</v>

680
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching this.</v>

681
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.860
<v Speaker 5>It's not disturbing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just dumb.</v>

682
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.293
<v Speaker 5>They just eating weird food and then and</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting like whip cream and ice cream </v>

683
00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 5>and cake and nachos altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well here's what happens.</v>

684
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is really targeted towards babies.</v>

685
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 5>They liked the colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what happened?</v>

686
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Like they see these flashing crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>colors.</v>

687
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:25.914
<v Speaker 5>Then I'm packaging candy and cake and </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating cake and two year olds love this </v>

688
00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep on clicking on it,</v>

689
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.770
<v Speaker 5>but pedophiles are also jerking off to </v>
<v Speaker 5>these girls putting chocolate bananas in</v>

690
00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was sort of the issue.</v>

691
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.900
<v Speaker 5>So they got the parents will subscribe </v>
<v Speaker 5>to whatever because the kids,</v>

692
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.240
<v Speaker 5>they want to put their kid in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the TV and have the TV babysit them,</v>

693
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 5>but it was also another big part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are watching this.</v>

694
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 5>You see the comments and sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>comments were like encrypted and like in</v>

695
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 5>different languages and they were using </v>
<v Speaker 5>code words.</v>

696
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.780

697
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.570

<v Speaker 5>If you make a big complaint though about</v>

698
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 5>something you have to draw a conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

699
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 5>it really makes it seem like you're the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person thinking that you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I didn't notice.</v>

707
00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:27.281
<v Speaker 5>You say what can and can't be on TV </v>
<v Speaker 5>though or on video or on,</v>

708
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.623
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When do you say they're going to want </v>

709
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know.</v>

710
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whose day?</v>

711
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we've all.</v>

712
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.013
<v Speaker 5>We've all got this weird thing about </v>
<v Speaker 5>free speech because if it wasn't for </v>

713
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 5>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we wouldn't be able to do anything,</v>

714
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be able to do podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be able to do comedy,</v>

715
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.293
<v Speaker 5>get in trouble for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very important to be able to </v>

716
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 5>express your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what if those ideas are,</v>

717
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.230
<v Speaker 5>you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a pedophile.</v>

718
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Like what if?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about that?</v>

719
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Are you allowed to do pedophile anime?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how it would.</v>

720
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where's the line and why?</v>

721
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 5>Why are we able to draw that line?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

722
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:02.310
<v Speaker 5>I draw a Dick Right now when I will </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive deck.</v>

723
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:03.303
<v Speaker 5>Here's a deck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now if I say this is a four year old </v>

724
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.340
<v Speaker 5>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

725
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

726
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I'll just say that four year olds got a </v>
<v Speaker 5>big Dick.</v>

727
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.043
<v Speaker 5>Just got a giant happy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He put a four year old posts around it </v>

728
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Speaker 5>too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you read,</v>

729
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 5>you raised a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

730
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:23.494
<v Speaker 5>I think the way it's working now is it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of whatever youtube decides or </v>

731
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 5>facebook decides because truly we </v>
<v Speaker 5>decide,</v>

732
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.663
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

733
00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll have these kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>vague policy guidelines,</v>

734
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 5>but then you'll see some people violate </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it's not a problem,</v>

735
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 5>but if it's a message that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

736
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.650
<v Speaker 5>then that seems to be the one that gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken off.</v>

737
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

738
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

739
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I honestly,</v>

740
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.993
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would defend free speech toward </v>

741
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.610
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

742
00:31:45.611 --> 00:31:48.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're inciting violence,</v>

743
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.173
<v Speaker 5>just legally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a defendant like you got to be allowed </v>

744
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 5>to say anything.</v>

745
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.353
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's like I wanna fuck kids or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's really disgusting like </v>

746
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:55.384
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're not actually fucking </v>

747
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not doing anything.</v>

748
00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.900
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotTa have fuel,</v>

754
00:32:10.181 --> 00:32:11.014
<v Speaker 5>be words that are bad that you're not </v>

<v Speaker 3>The only state that requires only of one</v>
<v Speaker 3>parent for 15 year old to marry has made</v>

787
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.470
<v Speaker 3>the state a popular destination for </v>
<v Speaker 3>child bride.</v>

788
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 3>That is so good job to the best child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broad Getaway,</v>

789
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.213
<v Speaker 3>Missouri in Missouri is defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time they've ever been </v>

790
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:47.880
<v Speaker 3>referred to as a popular destination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're.</v>

791
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.640
<v Speaker 3>They're doing what they can to attract </v>
<v Speaker 3>tourists.</v>

792
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's dark.</v>

793
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 3>That's dark because those places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

794
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:54.524
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professions are like moss gathering and </v>

795
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 3>making some sort of sap juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

796
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't marry a 15 year old though.</v>

797
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.380
<v Speaker 3>They can marry each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd imagine it's statutory rape is that,</v>

798
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a state where male to female,</v>

799
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 3>the girl had to be 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but male to male,</v>

800
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 3>the boiling had to be 13.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

801
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 3>that's a little bit of a gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the states where they were</v>

802
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.483
<v Speaker 3>pedophiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Catholic Church was sending </v>

803
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 3>pedophiles kind of want to say it's New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>

804
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico had some super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrely laws.</v>

805
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of childhood brides in Arizona.</v>

806
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona as child brides.</v>

807
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.263
<v Speaker 3>There's a bum fuck of every state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to Google this because </v>

808
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I think that is one of those states want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say it's New Mexico,</v>

809
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 3>but it might not have been where you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mail could be 18 or the male.</v>

810
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Could be a 13 man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's computers just going to have the</v>

811
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 3>most fucked up search history on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

812
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Where can I find a 13 year old boy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary.</v>

813
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.090
<v Speaker 3>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about male to female?</v>

814
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't that be different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of like boy to girl,</v>

815
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:11.570
<v Speaker 3>meaning like woman to to 14 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

816
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.763
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of different like </v>

817
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 3>the dogma of like there's no difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the sexes or shit like that.</v>

818
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like I don't,</v>

819
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's cool,</v>

820
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.703
<v Speaker 3>but when you hear about some hot chick </v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher who was fucking her teenage </v>

821
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:29.780
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't look at that the same</v>

822
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.230
<v Speaker 3>way that I look at some dude who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking teenage.</v>

823
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.063
<v Speaker 3>Like that's just a more fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at it as like she's a little bit </v>

824
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 3>more fucked up because I don't ever talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to women that are like,</v>

825
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 3>oh young dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm into.</v>

826
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:43.740
<v Speaker 3>And you are you talking to every dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the scenes?</v>

827
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

828
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 3>19 year old tractor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll be hot.</v>

829
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's definitely fucked up,</v>

830
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:50.120
<v Speaker 3>but those women play very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>roles in,</v>

831
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 3>in taking a young man's hand reading of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality.</v>

832
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I got molested by a 21 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old when I was 13.</v>

833
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 3>She was hot and it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>

834
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.143
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made out with me like the whole </v>

835
00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

836
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get a hard on.</v>

837
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I was a full panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't lose.</v>

838
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.600
<v Speaker 3>I was making out with this lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was she babysitting?</v>

839
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:14.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she lived down the street.</v>

840
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice person.</v>

841
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.540
<v Speaker 3>She played softball with us and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked a bunch of us when she was 21 and</v>

842
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:21.781
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

843
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 3>she was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

844
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.510
<v Speaker 3>She was fucked when she was a kid I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think could be anything.</v>

845
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 3>It's always passed down from a another </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

846
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably right.</v>

847
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.153
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

848
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.680
<v Speaker 3>She was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was very.</v>

849
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 3>She was a fun person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was fun to be around.</v>

850
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 3>We all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all liked her,</v>

851
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:41.650
<v Speaker 3>but she fucked everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

852
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.680
<v Speaker 3>So I just adore now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

853
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just grabbed my dick.</v>

854
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even get it up.</v>

855
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I panicked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't.</v>

856
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean they didn't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it up was like.</v>

857
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I think she was the first person ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>kissed.</v>

858
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 3>You didn't come back around to her </v>
<v Speaker 3>though later to see where you stepped up</v>

859
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:00.690
<v Speaker 3>and moved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved,</v>

860
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 3>we wound up moving into the next year </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I went to high school in a different</v>

861
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:05.424
<v Speaker 3>part of town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already jerking off for years at </v>

862
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 3>that point it's giving it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally jerking off from where I was,</v>

863
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:12.880
<v Speaker 3>like nine or eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started jerking off at night.</v>

864
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I about my teddy bears and my pillows.</v>

865
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same as jerking off to it?</v>

866
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.123
<v Speaker 3>Because then I would use my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like 10 and I remember I remember </v>

867
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the transition of not coming anything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I actually shot a liquid and it was</v>

868
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:32.640
<v Speaker 3>like I graduated in masturbation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd watched porn at that point,</v>

869
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's like an eighth grade </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduation.</v>

870
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:36.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not the real graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kinda like,</v>

871
00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:37.244
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to make them feel good </v>

872
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:38.544
<v Speaker 3>about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just jerk off until after I'd had </v>

873
00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

874
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start jerking off until after I</v>

875
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 3>had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why either.</v>

876
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere between 15 and 16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been 16.</v>

877
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 3>It might've been 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

878
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to feel this again.</v>

879
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to find a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is like I.</v>

880
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 3>When I started jerking off I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is what's going on.</v>

881
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my body is like,</v>

882
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 3>like completely addicted to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

883
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 17 years old or whatever the fuck</v>

884
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:16.530
<v Speaker 3>I was 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's just like girls,</v>

885
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you jerk off it's like Oh,</v>

886
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.320
<v Speaker 3>they're just just people without the </v>
<v Speaker 3>need for coming.</v>

887
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Like then you'd like them based on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>merits,</v>

888
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.220
<v Speaker 3>their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you just.</v>

889
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that literally</v>

890
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 5>when I was 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I just jerked off like what I was </v>

891
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 5>willing to tolerate with so much less we</v>
<v Speaker 5>will do.</v>

892
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:43.384
<v Speaker 5>When you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talking about the sexual robots </v>

893
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 5>before and if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we kind of got off on a.</v>

894
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 5>If pedophiles should be able to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

895
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 5>you kind of think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they have that built up pedophile,</v>

896
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:52.204
<v Speaker 5>full balls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>walking around just seeing kids just </v>

897
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 5>given up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way to fix that.</v>

898
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 5>I think their disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's like a sickness.</v>

899
00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you could like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if be able to fix them.</v>

900
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 5>I think when you even chemical </v>
<v Speaker 5>castration show like that.</v>

901
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.590
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

902
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

903
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:07.111
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

904
00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:07.944
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there are people that have this </v>

905
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:11.584
<v Speaker 5>inclination that would never act on it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and an ethics and morals they want to </v>

906
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 5>fuck anybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is also crazy.</v>

907
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

908
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like a nuclear suitcase.</v>

909
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:22.114
<v Speaker 5>He just walking around neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 5>just ready to detonate buildings and we </v>

910
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 5>just trust that he's never going to use </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

911
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing to want.</v>

912
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 5>Or if you can get like a weird video </v>
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>

913
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:32.584
<v Speaker 5>like you're hunting video game and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>just swallow up a building with a </v>

914
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.310
<v Speaker 5>suitcase once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

915
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:39.610
<v Speaker 5>like if he doesn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not a criminal,</v>

916
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 5>like if he has this thing and he fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>this demon every day and he successfully</v>

917
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.450
<v Speaker 5>slays at every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are we to come in and say,</v>

918
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't have these thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

919
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:52.320
<v Speaker 5>If anything I look at that is probably.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like quantum leap.</v>

927
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.143
<v Speaker 5>What a crazy sickness that you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>implant in someone's mind that if you </v>

00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 5>can molest them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will want to molest others.</v>

932
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.940
<v Speaker 5>to probably is where it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

933
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 5>Like stealing your joy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sucking the life out of your family less</v>

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.870
<v Speaker 5>than your kid and just being violent in </v>
<v Speaker 5>general.</v>

935
00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.960
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think most people who are like,</v>

936
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.990
<v Speaker 5>like a not violent and like the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 5>sentence,</v>

937
00:40:45.991 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 5>not in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:55.381
<v Speaker 5>assault and Kale and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I think 99 percent of the time</v>

941
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.400
<v Speaker 5>they were fucking beaten as a child.</v>

942
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.233
<v Speaker 5>They always kicks his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those guys can go play a video game </v>

943
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:03.844
<v Speaker 5>where they shoot people in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>head and they get off on that and </v>

944
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:09.370
<v Speaker 5>pedophiles don't have that same type of </v>
<v Speaker 5>outlet that those guys have.</v>

945
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting,</v>

946
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.100
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So isn't.</v>

947
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.910
<v Speaker 5>It's we look at pedophiles is almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>being worse than murder,</v>

948
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somebody wants to commit murder.</v>

949
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:20.870

<v Speaker 5>murder and we're like,</v>

950
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.270

<v Speaker 6>Jonbenet Ramsey story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the brother.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said that stories horseshit.</v>

976
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.260
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys are monsters.</v>

977
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:53.094
<v Speaker 6>My sister was fucking killed and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're blaming me and I didn't do a </v>

<v Speaker 6>goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

979
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:57.003
<v Speaker 6>he should really be upset at God because</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't look like a guy who fucked </v>

980
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:00.600
<v Speaker 6>and killed his sister.</v>

981
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.320
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Poor bastard.</v>

982
00:43:04.321 --> 00:43:05.154
<v Speaker 6>Magic grown up your whole life knowing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that someone fucked and killed your </v>

983
00:43:07.381 --> 00:43:08.214
<v Speaker 6>sister.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>he's got a crazy big uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

985
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.493
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it be jealous too because they give her </v>

986
00:43:11.911 --> 00:43:13.620
<v Speaker 6>more attention the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like Marcia,</v>

987
00:43:13.621 --> 00:43:14.311
<v Speaker 6>Marcia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Marcia,</v>

988
00:43:14.311 --> 00:43:16.140
<v Speaker 6>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my favorite.</v>

989
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:21.200
<v Speaker 6>My favorite theory is the brother did it</v>
<v Speaker 6>by accident and the parents try to cover</v>

990
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:22.284
<v Speaker 6>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's just my favorite documentary </v>

991
00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:26.910
<v Speaker 6>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They connected the handwriting.</v>

992
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:27.773
<v Speaker 6>They were trying to connect the </v>
<v Speaker 6>handwriting of the ransom note or </v>

993
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:34.530
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one whatever note was left behind.</v>

994
00:43:34.531 --> 00:43:35.364
<v Speaker 6>There was a note left behind and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>said it was really similar to the </v>

995
00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:41.020
<v Speaker 6>mother's handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They cuddled ticket.</v>

996
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.140
<v Speaker 6>They made a conclusive decision about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

997
00:43:43.141 --> 00:43:43.974
<v Speaker 6>but that's like what if you have normal </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand writing somebody else's normal </v>

998
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.023
<v Speaker 6>handwriting and they kill your kid and </v>
<v Speaker 6>now people think you killed your kid </v>

999
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:50.670
<v Speaker 6>because you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Normal.</v>

1000
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.690
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How,</v>

1001
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.523
<v Speaker 6>like you got to defend the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>like put a little curve on the younger </v>

1002
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.180
<v Speaker 6>your is handwriting Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean does it.</v>

1003
00:43:57.181 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Speaker 6>That is it that good?</v>

1004
00:43:59.010 --> 00:43:59.843
<v Speaker 4>I didn't find a handwriting expert that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you pay them enough they'll say that </v>

1005
00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 4>it's not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all bullshit guys and whoever</v>

1006
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 4>you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's gotta be some science behind</v>

1007
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:08.084
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There must be looped if you ever like </v>

1008
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.263
<v Speaker 4>seen them analyze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's I've seen like undocumented is and </v>

1009
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 4>how they analyze it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they loop it that way the same</v>

1010
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all at the same angles,</v>

1011
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.650
<v Speaker 4>but they will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will use that in courts.</v>

1012
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:19.484
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think it's substantial </v>

1013
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Polygraphs,</v>

1014
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.683
<v Speaker 4>like there's some science to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like you can't get </v>

1015
00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 4>convicted off that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe anybody that passed a</v>

1016
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 4>polygraph test.</v>

1017
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.050
<v Speaker 6>You'd see it up on the screen up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's</v>

1018
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:32.893
<v Speaker 3>a Jonbenet Ramsey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Ramsey's ransom note and patty </v>

1019
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:41.391
<v Speaker 3>Ramsey and you watch how she writes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch how rent Patty Patsy,</v>

1020
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Patsy Ramsey writes and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1021
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.150
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't even try to hide it.</v>

1022
00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she writes the same way,</v>

1023
00:44:49.551 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 3>the ages of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the end of the age yet,</v>

1024
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.190
<v Speaker 3>we'll look at the size of the a's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seas.</v>

1025
00:44:55.191 --> 00:44:56.024
<v Speaker 3>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very uniform in size from hers to the </v>

1026
00:44:59.181 --> 00:45:01.670
<v Speaker 3>ransom note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very different than John's</v>

1027
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.980
<v Speaker 3>like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a like,</v>

1028
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.240
<v Speaker 3>it's her handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now I see it.</v>

1029
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.140
<v Speaker 3>She killed us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have those words and it looks.</v>

1030
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really looks like she wrote that note.</v>

1031
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.773
<v Speaker 3>So the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patsy Ramsey at ransom note in the </v>

1032
00:45:17.411 --> 00:45:19.090
<v Speaker 3>middle is the one where she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1033
00:45:19.091 --> 00:45:20.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not my handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>daughter was dead and she was at a </v>

1149
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.130
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1150
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 2>She made them stop looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1151
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that than religion though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1152
00:50:35.581 --> 00:50:36.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sit there and the person that's </v>

1153
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 2>doing that on a dumb fucking stage more </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal.</v>

1154
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no religion.</v>

1155
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.770
<v Speaker 2>You are basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1156
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 2>you're projecting these ancient stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1157
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1158
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you're giving lessons in these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

1159
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>but when you're actually doing it to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single person that seems way worse.</v>

1160
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:56.264
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very focused and also religion </v>

1161
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 2>people get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are good intentions.</v>

1162
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:00.763
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's tradition and stuff where you </v>

1163
00:51:03.111 --> 00:51:04.400
<v Speaker 2>grow up that way and you just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1164
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.230
<v Speaker 2>But I know that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1165
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.153
<v Speaker 2>that's predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for someone to make </v>

1166
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 2>money by exploring like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible thing about their life in terms</v>

1167
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 2>of is it truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both equally probably,</v>

1168
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bullshit,</v>

1169
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.223
<v Speaker 2>but one is directly targeting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with somebody also probably </v>

1170
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.423
<v Speaker 2>killed millions and millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people and these people are </v>

1171
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.340
<v Speaker 2>just fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few idiots out of there.</v>

1172
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 2>But those idiots deserve to be duped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1173
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:31.094
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wounded antelopes should not go to the </v>

1174
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 2>waterhole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it goes.</v>

1175
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:36.550
<v Speaker 2>You get jack everything isn't antelope </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy.</v>

1176
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.473
<v Speaker 2>You Gel well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is dumb as they're supposed to get </v>

1177
00:51:40.161 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 2>taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

1178
00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you watch the documentary and honest</v>

1179
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:45.464
<v Speaker 2>liar about the amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy would go pick apart those </v>

1180
00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.940
<v Speaker 2>televangelists and like interrupt their </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency and expose their tricks.</v>

1181
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of those to a Uri Geller.</v>

1182
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:57.760
<v Speaker 2>He just tried to end him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

1183
00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Steve Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the entire.</v>

1184
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:01.583
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1185
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's all based off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they try to intercept that signal,</v>

1186
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but he did it with a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uri Geller,</v>

1187
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 2>the bending spoons guy made him go away </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about 20 years.</v>

1188
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this a million dollar challenge</v>

1189
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 2>and I believe Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look up the randy challenge.</v>

1190
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.033
<v Speaker 2>It's to show him any evidence of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of telekinetic powers or psychic </v>

1191
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:27.560
<v Speaker 2>abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any measurable psychic abilities and you</v>

1192
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:30.290
<v Speaker 2>can win a million bucks because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>can show shit.</v>

1193
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

1194
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.870
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a study,</v>

1195
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:33.704
<v Speaker 2>I believe at Princeton University that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him all this money to have these </v>

1196
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 2>guys come.</v>

1197
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

1198
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 2>he hired three other magicians and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to have them come sit there for days</v>

1199
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:42.284
<v Speaker 2>and try to figure out how to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy telekinetic thing and then they </v>

1200
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 2>ended up doing it and there was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>press conference and he was like,</v>

1201
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>they're all magicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no telekinesis goes,</v>

1202
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just show that it was a trick.</v>

1203
00:52:51.321 --> 00:52:52.154
<v Speaker 2>They all did and they got like 10 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those guys are fucking </v>

1204
00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:56.610
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1205
00:52:56.611 --> 00:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I did that show Joe Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1206
00:52:58.791 --> 00:52:59.624
<v Speaker 2>We did an episode on psychics and we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy named bandit check and he's a </v>

1207
00:53:02.871 --> 00:53:05.810
<v Speaker 2>vegas magician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a wizard dude.</v>

1208
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:10.400
<v Speaker 2>He does all the spoon bending shit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you and you know what it is,</v>

1209
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:11.151
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1210
00:53:11.151 --> 00:53:13.100
<v Speaker 2>he didn't explain it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go and Google it.</v>

1211
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not really the same metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some metal that if you just heat it</v>

1212
00:53:17.151 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 2>up by moving your hands back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just bends.</v>

1213
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I used to want to be a magician as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1214
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

1215
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.420
<v Speaker 2>if you take it like a cheap enough spoon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you literally just a,</v>

1216
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>you could bend</v>

1217
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 3>it like a few times and it'll just look </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

1218
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.513
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just use your finger and you make </v>

1219
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:31.704
<v Speaker 3>it melt away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is a very specific kind of </v>

1220
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:34.720
<v Speaker 3>metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do this too.</v>

1221
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1222
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.560
<v Speaker 3>But aluminum is like super weak in some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some forms,</v>

1223
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 3>not like car frame forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in some forms of not alloys.</v>

1224
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:43.973
<v Speaker 3>Aluminum is it scratches easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's metals that are like </v>

1225
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 3>our lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of lead scratches easier.</v>

1226
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of metal that's pliable.</v>

1227
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 3>You can bite into a gold coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1228
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:57.750
<v Speaker 3>You can actually see teeth marks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all people knew.</v>

1229
00:53:57.751 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 3>The goal was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This shit.</v>

1230
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Speaker 3>He just rubbed your fingers and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>droops.</v>

1231
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 3>It just gives in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent.</v>

1232
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:05.703
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys made this remarkably well for </v>

1233
00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:12.190
<v Speaker 3>four microphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

1234
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.520
<v Speaker 3>That would've never happened in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years.</v>

1235
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.560
<v Speaker 3>It was just screaming at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faggot for them.</v>

1236
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:23.500
<v Speaker 3>We're on our best behavior right now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is church Sunday for us.</v>

1237
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.070
<v Speaker 3>After you faggots first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1238
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine like precise science,</v>

1239
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.560
<v Speaker 3>how much people got freaked out by </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who like new magic or new,</v>

1240
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 3>some type of slight of hand like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you can look at Google,</v>

1241
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.540
<v Speaker 3>you can google that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1242
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:37.374
<v Speaker 3>there's a different type of metal that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can burn them and just like he is </v>

1243
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:40.194
<v Speaker 3>communicating with those people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to ask you questions that are </v>

1244
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 3>leading you into telling them the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>

1245
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those techniques to that.</v>

1246
00:54:51.691 --> 00:54:52.524
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Penn Jillette about that </v>

1247
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>once and he was explaining to me how </v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone talks to you,</v>

1248
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:57.383
<v Speaker 3>they get you to give them the answer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they say the answer and it makes </v>

1249
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:01.880
<v Speaker 3>them look like a wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just,</v>

1250
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 3>they've gone through these patterns so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

1251
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have problems with their</v>

1252
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:06.444
<v Speaker 3>dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people have a brother that </v>

1253
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:09.000
<v Speaker 3>died?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people you know,</v>

1254
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's someone missing.</v>

1255
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Who is my brother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1256
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1257
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 3>And this is not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

1258
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.880
<v Speaker 3>I see that he loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he misses you and he's very sad that</v>

1260
00:55:24.881 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get to say goodbye.</v>

1261
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he comes home.</v>

1262
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:30.234
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1263
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 3>she knew about my brother getting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dummy.</v>

1264
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.670
<v Speaker 3>You knew about your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

1265
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.600
<v Speaker 3>She'd tell you about some shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't happened yet.</v>

1266
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.733
<v Speaker 3>She's telling you about some shit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>already know because you're a dumb ass </v>

1267
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.580
<v Speaker 3>and you're playing checkers with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies playing chess on you.</v>

1268
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.323
<v Speaker 2>My friend who I stayed with when I'm out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here has a very good friend who's a </v>

1269
00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:52.960
<v Speaker 2>psychic medium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy,</v>

1270
00:55:52.961 --> 00:55:53.794
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she really wants to believe in him so </v>

1271
00:55:55.271 --> 00:55:59.410
<v Speaker 2>much and I'm farm the way he does is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining thing.</v>

1272
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:01.780
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe it at all.</v>

1273
00:56:01.781 --> 00:56:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's why I don't believe it.</v>

1274
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:08.680
<v Speaker 2>If you have fucking powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also like,</v>

1275
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:09.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to target because you need </v>

1276
00:56:10.211 --> 00:56:11.021
<v Speaker 2>shampoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1277
00:56:11.021 --> 00:56:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it would be a burden to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live with the gift of magic powers.</v>

1278
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:16.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1279
00:56:16.451 --> 00:56:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll swing by Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little hungry for a snack.</v>

1280
00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It all stems from US walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't</v>

1281
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 3>it be much if I knew exactly</v>

1282
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.083
<v Speaker 7>what was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>knew who these people who's good and </v>

1283
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 7>who's bad when that'd be better than </v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody has that feeling,</v>

1284
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 7>but nobody has those abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you go on knowledge and instincts and</v>

1285
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:35.584
<v Speaker 7>life experience and you compile it </v>
<v Speaker 7>altogether and some people are really </v>

1286
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 7>good at it and some people suck at it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the people that suck at it,</v>

1287
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.363
<v Speaker 7>they'd go to someone else for advice and</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the ways they go to advice that </v>

1288
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:46.330
<v Speaker 7>lady with the neon sign,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Psychic,</v>

1309
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:45.460
<v Speaker 7>supposed to survive invented some shit </v>

<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

1316
00:57:58.391 --> 00:57:59.224

<v Speaker 7>That none of us really know what the </v>

1317
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:01.084
<v Speaker 7>fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all like to to comfort ourselves by </v>

1318
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:04.414
<v Speaker 7>thinking we know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then if someone else can convince </v>

1319
00:58:06.341 --> 00:58:07.810

1323
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 7>People are followers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what it is.</v>

1324
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.310
<v Speaker 7>We should look at these psychics like we</v>
<v Speaker 7>look at coyotes,</v>

<v Speaker 7>out with dummies.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like the reference where he's like,</v>

1375
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.600
<v Speaker 2>we made a multicultural movie that </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed races working together too long.</v>

1376
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Dudes of just about like Bikini.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Maxim magazine,</v>

01:00:57.941 --> 01:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fast cars.</v>

1378
01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:01.210
<v Speaker 2>A Bikini to one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One six,</v>

1379
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:04.810
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the last one.</v>

1380
01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the budget was $250.</v>

1381
01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Million Dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1382
01:01:09.101 --> 01:01:12.020
<v Speaker 2>So they made three quarters a male solid</v>

1383
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 7>budget on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not even fucking crazy.</v>

1384
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 7>It's cars driving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got ludicrous.</v>

1385
01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>He must have a lot of special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Budget.</v>

1386
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:24.310
<v Speaker 2>That's shit's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to launch cars through the air.</v>

1387
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:26.710
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that they do is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

1388
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:27.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of it's CGI and </v>

1389
01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.460
<v Speaker 2>how much of it they're really dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with cars,</v>

1390
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.820
<v Speaker 2>but as a person who loves muscle cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts my heart.</v>

1391
01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Watching those cars get fucking launched</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the air.</v>

1392
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Much more so many of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only made so many 1969 chargers,</v>

1393
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feels that they're destroying them.</v>

1394
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I like the Dukes of hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many fucking chargers did they wreck</v>

1395
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.930
<v Speaker 2>for the Dukes of Hazzard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Launching them across a bridge landing.</v>

1396
01:01:52.931 --> 01:01:53.764
<v Speaker 2>I'm nose down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the car bend drive away like </v>

1397
01:01:56.051 --> 01:01:56.884
<v Speaker 2>nothing's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How Louis Myeloma noticed and they kill </v>

1398
01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:00.634
<v Speaker 2>like 15 years.</v>

1399
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 7>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That movie.</v>

1400
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 7>You remember the movie my own Otis?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1401
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:08.330
<v Speaker 7>Pug nose pop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>little orange cat.</v>

1402
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.160
<v Speaker 7>Fucking grateful that I got to be honest</v>
<v Speaker 7>with you.</v>

1403
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:11.643
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it holds up the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 7>pugs and kittens that died during the </v>

1404
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:15.284
<v Speaker 7>making of this film.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to watch it because otherwise </v>

1405
01:02:17.011 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 7>otherwise they died in vain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They took the,</v>

1406
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 7>like it was</v>

1407
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 5>another movie that was made in like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan or China or somewhere in Asia.</v>

1408
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they didn't give a fuck.</v>

1409
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 5>There was no walls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1410
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:27.780
<v Speaker 5>how you treat a cats and dogs in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

1411
01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 5>They don't care how you treat humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>back there.</v>

1412
01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 5>So there's a scene where the dog is </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting off a bear and this bear,</v>

1413
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean they must have just went through </v>
<v Speaker 5>30 pugs with this bear scene alone,</v>

1414
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.250
<v Speaker 5>but there's no confirm numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>deaths.</v>

1415
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.170
<v Speaker 5>But there was like a bunch of other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you watched the movie,</v>

1416
01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:44.970
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1417
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:45.803
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did they get that dog to fight with </v>

1418
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:47.574
<v Speaker 5>that bear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

1419
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.980
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we lost like $300.</v>

1420
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:53.530
<v Speaker 5>That's how we did a Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really a bunch of.</v>

1421
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.030
<v Speaker 5>There's a scene where he's in the water </v>
<v Speaker 5>swimming,</v>

1422
01:02:56.650 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 5>maybe eight of them right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many dogs tied?</v>

1423
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 5>We looked it up one time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget a lot.</v>

1424
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 5>I know Dudley Moore narrated at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight in that scene.</v>

1425
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is so crazy.</v>

1426
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 5>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at the elks head behind you.</v>

1427
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 5>Damage more value that elc has done a </v>
<v Speaker 5>puppy.</v>

1428
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.170
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we put so much more value when</v>
<v Speaker 5>a puppy's life versus that elk slide.</v>

1429
01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.640
<v Speaker 5>Cute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cute,</v>

1430
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 5>cute privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like you'll swap out mosquito.</v>

1431
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only care about human swat mosquitoes.</v>

1432
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good point.</v>

1433
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.023
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kill plants which are living right and </v>

1434
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only care about humans and dogs.</v>

1435
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Love peanut butter off your dead cats </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

1436
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I do enjoy cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never liked cats,</v>

1437
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 5>but then my girlfriend brought her mom's</v>
<v Speaker 5>cat to live with us for a little bit and</v>

1438
01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 5>I got attached to that fucking cat </v>
<v Speaker 5>fiance kind of animals.</v>

1439
01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:54.084
<v Speaker 5>I love them in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love them and I just love them in </v>

1440
01:03:56.641 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 5>their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's.</v>

1441
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.823
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a weird thing that we've gotten </v>

1442
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 5>totally accustomed to that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>just get out of this studio right now.</v>

1443
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 5>You could drive 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 minutes over to Pang cane.</v>

1444
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 5>Get out of your car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>walk 300 yards into the woods and you're</v>

1445
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:13.470
<v Speaker 5>just living with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating animals.</v>

1446
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.330
<v Speaker 5>You are basically in another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's eagles when there's not too many</v>

1447
01:04:18.331 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 5>eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of hawks that fly around,</v>

1448
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:21.563
<v Speaker 5>they're just constantly looking for some</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit to Jack and if either there at the </v>

1449
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:24.264
<v Speaker 5>right time you could see it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see a coyote snatch a rabbit or </v>

1450
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.553
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different animals just constantly </v>

1451
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 5>looking for something else to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>

1452
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're so removed from it.</v>

1453
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:35.730
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to be like,</v>

1454
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:38.670
<v Speaker 5>well you put yourself out there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big difference between New York</v>

1455
01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:39.504
<v Speaker 5>and La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like la is the city where there's </v>

1456
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.693
<v Speaker 5>beautiful nature within it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York's like just the city and then </v>

1457
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:45.780
<v Speaker 5>you've got to leave to go to any </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful.</v>

1458
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's almost like you can be,</v>

1459
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.970
<v Speaker 5>but I mean just the fact that we just </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1460
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 5>you go to a grocery store and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship with animals is like,</v>

1461
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 5>there's a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me pick it up and buy it.</v>

1462
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.910
<v Speaker 5>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them like,</v>

1463
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:57.023
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this came from fucking killing a cow in </v>

1464
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.900
<v Speaker 5>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever go to Malibu once?</v>

1465
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.400
<v Speaker 5>There's places in Malibu that it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like ranches,</v>

1466
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:09.150
<v Speaker 5>like they're really long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's something like 30 something</v>

1467
01:05:09.151 --> 01:05:12.090
<v Speaker 5>miles of coast and along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like up in the hill,</v>

1468
01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:15.750
<v Speaker 5>there's like Alpaca farms and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and that shit.</v>

1469
01:05:15.751 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 5>You could just get in your car and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

1470
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 5>you're in La and</v>

1471
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.860
<v Speaker 6>then get in your car and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in the Alpaca farm.</v>

1472
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 6>That nature you're describing those </v>
<v Speaker 6>scares the shit out of the hamster ball.</v>

1473
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:25.303
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to show the dog tell that </v>

1474
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 6>none of this is the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is from the movie,</v>

1475
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 6>but this is actually having that bear </v>
<v Speaker 6>killed that dog.</v>

1476
01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is so crazy.</v>

1477
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 6>And the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bear dog fights off the bear.</v>

1478
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.593
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's so crazy that they allowed </v>

1479
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 6>this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1480
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 6>Like you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh man,</v>

1481
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 6>they must have had the best animal </v>
<v Speaker 6>trainers.</v>

1482
01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nope.</v>

1483
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 6>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We threw a dog versus a bad God.</v>

1484
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:51.574
<v Speaker 6>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine what the fucking pugs looked </v>

1485
01:05:55.421 --> 01:06:00.410
<v Speaker 6>like to after bears just ripping apart.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it that it was.</v>

1489

<v Speaker 6>broke.</v>

1491
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 6>It's back and the Moose just goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A Moose.</v>

1492
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 6>Moose are so big.</v>

<v Speaker 6>that they're so powerful that swatting </v>

<v Speaker 6>Just dragging it through the woods.</v>

1500
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.400
<v Speaker 6>Those fucking animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you want.</v>

<v Speaker 6>a beating up this bear,</v>

1506
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.833
<v Speaker 6>and then it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a famous video of a bear just </v>

1507
01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:13.354
<v Speaker 6>killing a deer in the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in the deer is making them as </v>

1508
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:15.994
<v Speaker 6>awful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horrible sound you'll ever hear her </v>

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 6>entire life and Louis goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the deere makes a come back,</v>

1510
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.150
<v Speaker 6>wait for it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait for it,</v>

<v Speaker 6>watch the deer being mauled alive with </v>

1512
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:27.490
<v Speaker 6>the most horrible sound and then let it </v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

1513
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.463
<v Speaker 6>That's the old frank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was hoping there was like a dude's </v>

1514
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:32.410
<v Speaker 6>dick somewhere in the help too.</v>

1515
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.480
<v Speaker 6>To be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of has pranks.</v>

1516
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:37.140
<v Speaker 6>Do have a dude's Dick and it somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this one is just barren,</v>

1517
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.033
<v Speaker 6>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:38.943
<v Speaker 6>That's how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bears are different than other animals </v>

1519
01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.950
<v Speaker 6>in that they eat a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They eat a lot of berries,</v>

1520
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 6>a lot of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they also eat animals.</v>

1521
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 6>Whatever they get ahold of so they don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>kill the animal first.</v>

1522
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.190
<v Speaker 6>There are also real sturdy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're.</v>

1523
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.960
<v Speaker 6>They're not like a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like cats are really powerful,</v>

1524
01:07:55.961 --> 01:08:00.961
<v Speaker 6>but cats are more flexible and pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A bears more of a just a fucking machine</v>

1525
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.850
<v Speaker 6>or bears more of like a like cats are </v>
<v Speaker 6>like hoists.</v>

1526
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:04.601
<v Speaker 6>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bear's,</v>

1527

1528
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:09.520

1529
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 6>Melvin manhoef.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just a powerhouse.</v>

1530
01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 6>Dave Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a hairy gay guy.</v>

1531
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not the different kind</v>

1532
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.190
<v Speaker 3>of bare pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson.</v>

1535
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:23.583
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually more like brock because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've learned with Frank Mir describe </v>

1536
01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:26.001
<v Speaker 3>rockland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Top of him.</v>

1537
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:26.834
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a car that was slowly onto </v>

1538
01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.400
<v Speaker 3>him and he couldn't push it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1539
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine a bears on you.</v>

1540
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 3>You're just like sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1541
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:36.640
<v Speaker 3>it's got my shoulder blade and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that my shoulder blade and I'm.</v>

1542
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing you can do.</v>

1543
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you went,</v>

1544
01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:40.923
<v Speaker 3>you're the adrenaline will kick in where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't feel the pain or do you </v>

1545
01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:44.270
<v Speaker 3>think it would be the most horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

1546
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 3>He definitely wouldn't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd feel it.</v>

1547
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.593
<v Speaker 3>It would hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you would be so terrified of death </v>

1548
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:50.924
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be so overwhelmed with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking neurochemicals to be </v>

1549
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:58.550
<v Speaker 3>flying through your synapses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be out of your mind.</v>

1550
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.620
<v Speaker 4>You'd feel like the pressure of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happening.</v>

1551
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.353
<v Speaker 3>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd.</v>

1552
01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:09.780
<v Speaker 3>There'd be so much adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be in another dimension before you</v>

1553
01:09:09.781 --> 01:09:10.614
<v Speaker 3>knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a trigger that seems </v>

1554
01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>like the worst way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a guy who got bit real bad and came</v>

1555
01:09:16.381 --> 01:09:17.214
<v Speaker 3>back and had a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a selfie and talked about what </v>

1556
01:09:20.641 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just walking,</v>

1557
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.510
<v Speaker 3>hiking down a trail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scouting,</v>

1558
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:28.590
<v Speaker 3>and he came upon A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a female grizzly and her cubs,</v>

1559
01:09:28.591 --> 01:09:31.740
<v Speaker 3>which is the worst scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A male grizzly doesn't really,</v>

1560
01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.740
<v Speaker 3>unless he's really old and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>late in the season.</v>

1561
01:09:34.741 --> 01:09:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Usually they'll just get the fuck away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you,</v>

1562
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.493
<v Speaker 3>but the females will fuck you up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this female fucked him up and tore his </v>

1563
01:09:40.951 --> 01:09:45.720
<v Speaker 3>scalp right off of his skull and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like packed down with a baseball hat,</v>

1564
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:46.973
<v Speaker 3>like try to try to hold it in place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his arm snapped and he had big bite </v>

1565
01:09:51.211 --> 01:09:52.044
<v Speaker 3>marks in his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy was like a Montana dude </v>

1566
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.940
<v Speaker 3>like in the Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough.</v>

1567
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.833
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1568
01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:59.040
<v Speaker 3>vitals are intact.</v>

1569
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Might be broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on up there.</v>

1570
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking yoga teacher in La.</v>

1571
01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There he is.</v>

1572
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Down his head.</v>

1573
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 4>The grizzly with two cubs you can barely</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

1574
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:27.011
<v Speaker 4>but the right side of his ear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his head is basically ripped apart.</v>

1575
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I'll save my watch though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He put the hat on to make himself like,</v>

1576
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.480
<v Speaker 4>you know my fucking kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never got my daddy's wash.</v>

1577
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 4>He drove himself to the hospital after </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking three miles to his car.</v>

1578
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll.</v>

1579
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.703
<v Speaker 4>I'll be damned if I'm not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gosh darn best facebook live video </v>

1581
01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:49.990
<v Speaker 4>the hole in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My God,</v>

1582
01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:50.691
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>

1583
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:53.480

<v Speaker 4>a fucking Montana dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1599
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.970
<v Speaker 3>look at the power in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it grabs her lunch,</v>

1600
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 3>imagine how terrified she must've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone's slapping it,</v>

1601
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 3>bitch slapping it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The host is getting in there.</v>

1602
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.553
<v Speaker 3>Why would the host get in there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you crazy dudes wrestling with a </v>

1603
01:12:08.981 --> 01:12:13.090
<v Speaker 3>bear that is a Russian who's that good </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique?</v>

1604
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 3>That guy has to be rushed and look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power in his fucking getting.</v>

1605
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>He's almost got the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's almost got the bear out.</v>

1606
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is so crazy.</v>

1607
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 3>And the bear still holding onto that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person was fucking that personnel also,</v>

1608
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 3>not even the hardest day of her life in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

1609
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made.</v>

1610
01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 3>She must've got fucked up by that bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1611
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bear.</v>

1612
01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Didn't use great technique to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the team,</v>

1613
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:36.383
<v Speaker 3>but he just kind of powered out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that saved her life is </v>

1614
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.950
<v Speaker 3>that that bear had a muzzle on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

1615
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:45.951
<v Speaker 3>He looks at her like she said something </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive you can't predict and that's a</v>

1616
01:12:46.891 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 3>brown bear that's similar to a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

1617
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Probably the Russian version of a brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

1618
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:55.330
<v Speaker 3>They have big ass bears over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that dude.</v>

1620
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Fuck bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1621
01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:57.774
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a real grizzly bear in the wild </v>

1622
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.740
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like 30,</v>

1623
01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 3>40 yards and looked me in the eyes and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember thinking,</v>

1624
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different look.</v>

1625
01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:08.254
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

1626
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.093
<v Speaker 3>It's jewelry wasn't even a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only like a six foot tall </v>

1627
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:12.750
<v Speaker 3>grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not a big grizzly,</v>

1628
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.280
<v Speaker 3>but it looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked.</v>

1629
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:16.320
<v Speaker 3>They looked through you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>

1630
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1631
01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.560
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it safe to safe?</v>

1632
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:20.543
<v Speaker 3>They have their brains calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a weapon on you or you have </v>

1633
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.373
<v Speaker 3>two shotguns and two bows and arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still I'd probably take a while to </v>

1634
01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 3>shotguns and one bone arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a shotgun.</v>

1635
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 3>My Tas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would take a while.</v>

1637
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1638
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big animal.</v>

1639
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Even a six foot one is probably probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds.</v>

1640
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big animal,</v>

1641
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's the way they look at you that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1642
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.133
<v Speaker 3>Like I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen black bears in the wild and </v>

1643
01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:48.840
<v Speaker 3>they look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>

1644
01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>

1645
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Grizzlies look right through you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look right through you.</v>

1646
01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:57.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird like dead look like there's</v>

1647
01:13:57.271 --> 01:14:00.360
<v Speaker 3>no fear of you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do I do here?</v>

1648
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 3>They just trying to figure out whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not you're a meal.</v>

1649
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You're just wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagined piano.</v>

1650
01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.160
<v Speaker 3>300 pound animal that just has to wander</v>
<v Speaker 3>around looking for shit to eat.</v>

1651
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to the life of big Joe.</v>

1652
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:12.963
<v Speaker 2>Can you please stop describing the wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals conventions I've been in my </v>

<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a fucking crazy bear.</v>

1654
01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you see this thing come and run </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it will eat.</v>

1655
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:26.701
<v Speaker 2>You are human being 300 pounds that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming at you.</v>

1656
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:30.710

<v Speaker 2>put it out of their misery animal.</v>

1657
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred pounds that is hungry.</v>

1658
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 6>Imaginary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no stores</v>

1659
01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.250
<v Speaker 2>looking for hunters and slipping.</v>

1661
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.230
<v Speaker 6>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1662
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.203

<v Speaker 6>she's the guide and she smacked a </v>

1663
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:50.014
<v Speaker 6>fucking tree with the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She picked up the stick and crack this </v>

<v Speaker 6>They new fuck bitch ass.</v>

1666
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:06.370
<v Speaker 6>Bear Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we saw a couple of them,</v>

1667
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:08.590
<v Speaker 6>so one of them we think on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the road,</v>

1668
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 6>it's got to be terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but with the weapons,</v>

1669
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 6>you're like it sorta on still,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1670
01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.590
<v Speaker 6>you don't know how many are out there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you have them out there,</v>

1671
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:18.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've,</v>

1672
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.183
<v Speaker 6>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've seen one way bigger than the </v>

1673
01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:21.550
<v Speaker 6>ones I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1674
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:22.384
<v Speaker 6>what about people that say this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always like the people that are </v>

1675
01:15:24.491 --> 01:15:24.791
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1676
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:25.960
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you think you're a real man,</v>

1677
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:26.794
<v Speaker 6>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll give you a knife and you go out </v>

1678
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 6>there and then you try to hunt a bear.</v>

1679
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 6>I always feel like even if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>gun,</v>

1680
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 6>it's going to not be that easy to just </v>
<v Speaker 6>go and fucking kill a bear.</v>

1681
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.673
<v Speaker 6>But you know why all these people say </v>
<v Speaker 6>that shit is because they don't </v>

1682
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:40.540
<v Speaker 6>understand what a bear really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in their head.</v>

1683
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.673
<v Speaker 6>They feel like a bear is like some </v>
<v Speaker 6>mythical creature who lives in the </v>

1684
01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:49.501
<v Speaker 6>forest so she'd be left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is you can't just leave them</v>

1685
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.004
<v Speaker 6>alone because they're so powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're so hungry and they eat so much </v>

1686
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:58.480
<v Speaker 6>that if there's nothing that keeps them </v>
<v Speaker 6>in check,</v>

1687
01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.573
<v Speaker 6>they're gonna just run rampant and </v>
<v Speaker 6>destroy all the deer and the Moose and </v>

1688
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 6>all those other things you like to look </v>
<v Speaker 6>at as well.</v>

1689
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.210
<v Speaker 6>They're going to kill all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were to kill 50 percent of</v>

1690
01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.540
<v Speaker 2>just you can</v>

1691
01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.050
<v Speaker 6>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1692
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.713
<v Speaker 6>you're also like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to keep the populations </v>

1693
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.113
<v Speaker 6>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's very tricky and humans are </v>

1694
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 6>supposed to play a part in this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's.</v>

1695
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.313
<v Speaker 6>We don't like to think we play a part in</v>
<v Speaker 6>it because we can communicate and we </v>

1696
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:26.854
<v Speaker 6>discuss things and we rationalize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have culture and those are all those </v>

1697
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:30.934
<v Speaker 6>things are all correct,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we've always kept predators and </v>

1698
01:16:34.001 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 6>check because when they start killing us</v>
<v Speaker 6>that means,</v>

1699
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to do something now,</v>

1700
01:16:38.321 --> 01:16:39.154
<v Speaker 6>and then we killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's always been the case with </v>

1701
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:45.190
<v Speaker 6>villages and Jaguars and people who live</v>
<v Speaker 6>in towns and wolves.</v>

1702
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.470
<v Speaker 6>It's always been the case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There is a food chain.</v>

1703
01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:50.500
<v Speaker 6>We're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just have insulated ourselves from it</v>

1704
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:54.340
<v Speaker 6>with cities so thoroughly that we've </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgot about this connection,</v>

1705
01:16:54.341 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 6>so all these people that are peta </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1706
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:58.870
<v Speaker 6>a good percentage of them are living in </v>
<v Speaker 6>cities.</v>

1707
01:16:59.230 --> 01:16:59.801
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

1708
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:00.634
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about a culture that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't understand talking about a world </v>

1709
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:04.773
<v Speaker 6>that you I don't idealize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you say like we kept the </v>

1710
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 6>predators and check like not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 6>well</v>

1711
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.903
<v Speaker 5>as we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We always tried to do it and then after </v>

1712
01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:13.454
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years of this struggle </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we fucking got the upper hand and </v>

1713
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:17.323
<v Speaker 5>started dominating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was easy to sit in a city and be </v>

1714
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:19.680
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1715
01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.513
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you read your kids these books about </v>

1716
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:22.784
<v Speaker 5>nature and it's like the frog made </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends with the squirrel and </v>

1717
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 5>everything's just nice and nature were </v>
<v Speaker 5>the assholes.</v>

1718
01:17:27.261 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 5>Like people are the assholes because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>pollute and we do this.</v>

1719
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:30.321
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1720
01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:31.154
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the real fucking asshole is the </v>

1721
01:17:32.211 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 5>state of nature where your fucking kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets ripped apart by a fucking predator.</v>

1722
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.970
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the shit you don't want to do.</v>

1723
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:40.660
<v Speaker 5>Where's that fucking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bye.</v>

1724
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:42.820
<v Speaker 6>The answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1725
01:17:42.821 --> 01:17:43.654
<v Speaker 6>I think the answer is comes in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle that people have to realize the </v>

1726
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:48.023
<v Speaker 6>real problem on the side of people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>eat meat and people that don't think </v>

1727
01:17:51.311 --> 01:17:54.160
<v Speaker 6>Peta people are ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is factory farming.</v>

1728
01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:54.994
<v Speaker 6>That's what's against us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The most horrific evidence is not </v>

1729
01:17:57.971 --> 01:17:58.804
<v Speaker 6>impeded side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean in terms of like something that </v>

1730
01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.960
<v Speaker 6>they're accused of the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 6>evidenced by far.</v>

1731
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.710
<v Speaker 6>It's coming out of these factory farms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you had to pick like which side.</v>

1732
01:18:08.711 --> 01:18:09.544
<v Speaker 6>If you look at the two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like which side makes more sense with </v>

1733
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.060
<v Speaker 6>the pizza side makes way more sense than</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking factory farm people bolt are</v>

1734
01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:17.914
<v Speaker 6>extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see those videos where it's like </v>

1735
01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:24.150
<v Speaker 6>Auschwitz of cows and doing numbers into</v>
<v Speaker 6>their forearms.</v>

1736
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:27.370
<v Speaker 6>It's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think the,</v>

1737
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.210
<v Speaker 6>if the meeting population doesn't accept</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that this is,</v>

1738
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:35.800
<v Speaker 6>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's should be impossible.</v>

1739
01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.693
<v Speaker 6>It should be impossible for a civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>healthy person to accept this as a </v>

1740
01:18:40.691 --> 01:18:43.900
<v Speaker 6>reality for those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the Peta people are right about that.</v>

1741
01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:44.993
<v Speaker 6>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that you shouldn't be able </v>

1742
01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:47.940
<v Speaker 6>to eat any animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like mmm.</v>

1743
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:49.293
<v Speaker 6>I don't agree because what are you going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do with all these animals and the </v>

1744
01:18:51.731 --> 01:18:56.260
<v Speaker 6>best way in terms of like health,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best way to live is eating mammals,</v>

1745
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.183
<v Speaker 6>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eating animals and vegetables together </v>

1746
01:18:58.571 --> 01:18:59.404
<v Speaker 6>seems to be the best way to exist seems </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be when you look at all these </v>

1747
01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:04.744
<v Speaker 6>objective scientific studies that talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about nutrients and plants versus </v>

1748
01:19:08.981 --> 01:19:09.814
<v Speaker 6>nutrients and animal products or leans </v>
<v Speaker 6>very heavily towards a diet that's rich </v>

1749
01:19:13.961 --> 01:19:14.794
<v Speaker 6>in of those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no people in the world that are </v>

1750
01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.284
<v Speaker 6>fed that eat a meat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vegetables and fruit juice responsible </v>

1751
01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.513
<v Speaker 6>here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1752
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:25.530
<v Speaker 5>fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you guys are aggressive at home.</v>

1753
01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:28.140
<v Speaker 5>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like meat and vegetables and fruits.</v>

1754
01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's getting your shotgun,</v>

1755
01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:31.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all those things.</v>

1756
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:36.750
<v Speaker 5>But so six foot son of a bitches coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>right at Jason.</v>

1757
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:39.620
<v Speaker 5>Being a stick on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys,</v>

1758
01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:42.960
<v Speaker 5>don't nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

1759
01:19:42.961 --> 01:19:45.360
<v Speaker 5>And then it's also like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird shit that happens to you when they</v>

1760
01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:49.200
<v Speaker 5>go in those fucking Vegan soy diets like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie Kilstein started eating meat again</v>

1761
01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.000
<v Speaker 5>and he's fucking making sense again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally.</v>

1762
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:55.320
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he also tasted the wrath of his improper</v>

1763
01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.180
<v Speaker 6>inclinations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Me,</v>

1764
01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:58.014
<v Speaker 6>improper meaning he wasn't being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went along with his ideology because </v>

1765
01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:06.921
<v Speaker 6>he was terrified of the repercussions of</v>
<v Speaker 6>being against the stream and you know,</v>

1766
01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.193
<v Speaker 6>he saw like Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've talked about Jamie 100 times on </v>

1767
01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:12.414
<v Speaker 6>this podcast now after we did a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 6>together because he's a way more normal </v>

1768
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:19.410
<v Speaker 6>person now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's way more rational.</v>

1769
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.393
<v Speaker 6>Like when he was in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was frantic checking his twitter </v>

1770
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 6>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like constantly arguing with people,</v>

1771
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 6>calling people out of being a bigot or a</v>
<v Speaker 6>racist.</v>

1772
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:32.010
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're always trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>street cred for calling people out.</v>

1773
01:20:32.011 --> 01:20:32.844
<v Speaker 6>You're always constantly checking your </v>
<v Speaker 6>phone and see what horrible shit they </v>

1774
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:36.930
<v Speaker 6>said back to you and whether or not that</v>
<v Speaker 6>stings</v>

1775
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:40.300
<v Speaker 7>you're in a battle and that you almost </v>
<v Speaker 7>get addicted to that.</v>

1776
01:20:40.301 --> 01:20:41.134
<v Speaker 7>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I literally stopped using facebook like </v>

1777
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.233
<v Speaker 7>six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just deleted it because it was a lot </v>

1778
01:20:44.891 --> 01:20:45.724
<v Speaker 7>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't really publicly battle as much </v>

1779
01:20:46.811 --> 01:20:47.644
<v Speaker 7>on twitter with dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but on facebook I was really getting </v>

1780
01:20:49.181 --> 01:20:52.750
<v Speaker 7>into it with people for stupid shit and </v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just like,</v>

1781
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:55.690
<v Speaker 7>now that I don't do that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like just that weird,</v>

1782
01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:56.553
<v Speaker 7>nasty whatever vial feeling that that </v>
<v Speaker 7>gives you that you live in and you get </v>

1783
01:20:59.801 --> 01:21:01.330
<v Speaker 7>addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want to go back to it.</v>

1784
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.500
<v Speaker 7>It just feels so much better and Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 7>was definitely a victim of that,</v>

1785
01:21:05.501 --> 01:21:06.334
<v Speaker 7>but now you talk to them because I had </v>
<v Speaker 7>lunch with them before he even came </v>

1786
01:21:09.101 --> 01:21:09.720
<v Speaker 7>back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We talked,</v>

1787
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.550
<v Speaker 7>we had lunch in La and he almost seemed </v>
<v Speaker 7>broken.</v>

1788
01:21:12.551 --> 01:21:14.920
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He seemed like he definitely seemed like</v>

1789
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:17.980
<v Speaker 7>he was beaten down and had been through </v>
<v Speaker 7>some real fucking shit.</v>

1790
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.883
<v Speaker 6>I think the social industry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think being a social justice warrior </v>

1791
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.553
<v Speaker 6>is like exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to be looking at that hearing </v>

1792
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:27.570
<v Speaker 6>is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>

1793
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:32.380
<v Speaker 6>If inside of you give a fuck that much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty nice.</v>

1794
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:33.343
<v Speaker 6>But I mean it really is like when people</v>
<v Speaker 6>get angry about something like calming </v>

1795
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 6>people get angry back comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so like,</v>

1796
01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.213
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've had to.</v>

1797
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:40.343
<v Speaker 6>You've already through so many layers of</v>
<v Speaker 6>things to actually be angry about and </v>

1798
01:21:43.411 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 6>then some other things you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 6>angry about to get to comedy.</v>

1799
01:21:45.751 --> 01:21:46.584
<v Speaker 6>They're almost always not successful or </v>
<v Speaker 6>not as successful as they think they </v>

1800
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:50.334
<v Speaker 6>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Almost always no one who's successful </v>

1801
01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:52.854
<v Speaker 6>complaints about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one who is successful is pissed off </v>

1802
01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kevin Hart has a fucking $50,000,000</v>

1803
01:21:58.411 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 6>mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1804
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:00.463
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're absolutely right that aren't </v>

1805
01:22:02.301 --> 01:22:03.840
<v Speaker 6>doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>

1806
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:04.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1807
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.433
<v Speaker 6>and just kind of on a similar note,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think no one who's been through real </v>

1808
01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:10.380
<v Speaker 6>shit in their life gives a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 6>microaggressions.</v>

1809
01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:11.503
<v Speaker 6>Like it's literally like a privileged </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing and you don't have anything going </v>

1810
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 6>on that you actually are taking this as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a major issue,</v>

1811
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:20.760
<v Speaker 6>but you know what it also is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's evidence that you're in competition</v>

1812
01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:21.594
<v Speaker 6>with that person and unnecessarily so </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that you are deeming them to be </v>

1813
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:28.050
<v Speaker 6>unworthy of their success.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you get angry,</v>

1814
01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.293
<v Speaker 6>you're lashing out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's entirely because you feel like </v>

1815
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:33.950
<v Speaker 6>it's a race and you're so far behind the</v>
<v Speaker 6>regular folk,</v>

1816
01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.490
<v Speaker 6>the folk hart or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like whoever the fuck if the person</v>

1817
01:22:38.491 --> 01:22:42.390
<v Speaker 6>is that's way ahead of you instead of </v>
<v Speaker 6>just looking at it for what it is.</v>

1818
01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy works hard.</v>

1819
01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:44.230
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>

1820
01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:46.210
<v Speaker 7>Stressful at all in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You Go,</v>

1821
01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.920
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a really fucking fair thing.</v>

1861
01:24:12.311 --> 01:24:13.144
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you knew and all the other people </v>

1862
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:15.424
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there a nice point when you get to </v>

1863
01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:18.274
<v Speaker 2>at least where you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not miserably broke all the time </v>

1864
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 2>or you're in some at least path or lane </v>
<v Speaker 2>of where you want to go.</v>

1865
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.493
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does change your appreciation for </v>

1866
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:30.460
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It brings it back again.</v>

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 2>It brings it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just like somebody like somebody</v>

<v Speaker 7>there's like our experts,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you dumb fucking hacky shit and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>watching you the other way.</v>

1877
01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.793
<v Speaker 7>Washington Reagan and mock up Jeremiah </v>
<v Speaker 7>and just laughing your Dick off because </v>

<v Speaker 7>it's not you,</v>

1879
01:24:56.901 --> 01:24:59.330
<v Speaker 7>but it's not about your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's about what's going to tickle you.</v>

1880
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.183
<v Speaker 7>There is not about the,</v>

1881
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:03.070
<v Speaker 2>we've had this conversation a lot and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1882
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:03.953
<v Speaker 2>I think what New York lax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la embrace as much more is the silly </v>

1883
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.160
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1884
01:25:10.161 --> 01:25:11.780
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough like silly,</v>

1885
01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you do something silly or even pull </v>

1887
01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:17.570
<v Speaker 2>out a guitar for whatever reason on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

1888
01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I think there's not even a chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe wait,</v>

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.380
<v Speaker 2>this might be like a unique or guitar,</v>

<v Speaker 7>like he's making eye contact with almost</v>

<v Speaker 3>he said he didn't really say that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have distorted what he </v>

2049
01:32:48.671 --> 01:32:49.670
<v Speaker 3>originally said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2050
01:32:49.671 --> 01:32:53.070
<v Speaker 3>because he was talking like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be like the first guy ever.</v>

2051
01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:53.913
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it was Michael Douglas was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first guy ever to get mouth cancer </v>

2052
01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 3>from eating pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be like,</v>

2053
01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:58.960
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real thing,</v>

2054
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:00.003
<v Speaker 3>but it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best reason to give for having </v>

2055
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 3>mouth cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how'd you get that mouth?</v>

2056
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:03.784

<v Speaker 3>Bad Ass was eating tons of lack a </v>

2057
01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:08.864
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that trap and trailer has </v>

2058
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:12.780
<v Speaker 3>sucked it right out of that square to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hot and in the mouth like right down the</v>

2060

01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Give me a cortisone shot in this thing.</v>

2065
01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I got an 11 at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crawling off the walls.</v>

2066
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.750
<v Speaker 3>This bitch is crazy and she's hot as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sun,</v>

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:48.580
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going back to work once that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy sucked.</v>

2068
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Your doctor wants to know because </v>
<v Speaker 3>without warning,</v>

2069
01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:59.950
<v Speaker 3>wanting to get too specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular cancers caused by HPV,</v>

2070
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:04.060
<v Speaker 3>which actually comes from cunnilingus </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst other things,</v>

2071
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.920
<v Speaker 3>but he took it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't worry if stress caused my son's</v>

2072
01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2073
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.050
<v Speaker 3>stress caused by my son's incarceration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't help trigger it.</v>

2074
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sexually transmitted disease.</v>

2075
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:18.330
<v Speaker 3>It causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2076
01:34:18.331 --> 01:34:18.971
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2077
01:34:18.971 --> 01:34:20.900
<v Speaker 3>HP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to put our dicks and</v>

2078
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 3>are and shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut your mouth.</v>

2079
01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killer platform.</v>

2080
01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Get every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 60,</v>

2081
01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:29.620
<v Speaker 3>90 with my check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2082
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:32.990
<v Speaker 3>we're just given each other kids right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and it makes me a little bit harder.</v>

2083
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.823
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have like a cancer doctor has to </v>

2084
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:36.730
<v Speaker 3>charge you like smoking cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

2085
01:34:36.731 --> 01:34:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to keep eating pussy,</v>

2086
01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:39.124
<v Speaker 3>I can't see you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably exactly what it's going </v>

2087
01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:41.634
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day I just picked kiss their clit </v>

2088
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:45.190
<v Speaker 3>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

2089
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is now they have a vaccine,</v>

2090
01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 3>so now you get that hpv vaccine you </v>
<v Speaker 3>never have to worry about.</v>

2091
01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.190
<v Speaker 3>You have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2092
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:52.750
<v Speaker 3>so they're giving it to young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2093
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Good dudes and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

2094
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:57.640
<v Speaker 3>it's a vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it come a risky one.</v>

2095
01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2096
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.820
<v Speaker 6>like there's some side effects and some </v>
<v Speaker 6>people had,</v>

2097
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>depending on your biology.</v>

2098
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.310
<v Speaker 6>Some people are pretty extreme side </v>
<v Speaker 6>effects apparently.</v>

2099
01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 6>Like people who have gotten really sick </v>
<v Speaker 6>from that.</v>

2100
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:10.640
<v Speaker 6>A HPV vaccine that happens with almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the vaccines.</v>

2101
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 6>Those certain people get really sick </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

2102
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:13.223
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is the problem with this </v>

2103
01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:16.370
<v Speaker 6>whole anti vaccine movement is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not.</v>

2104
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.293
<v Speaker 6>They don't understand the nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 6>details of what it means to take an </v>

2105
01:35:22.461 --> 01:35:23.294
<v Speaker 6>entire population of 300 million people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and try to figure out a vaccine that's </v>

2106
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:32.150
<v Speaker 6>going to protect them from disease.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to work on everybody.</v>

2107
01:35:32.151 --> 01:35:34.040
<v Speaker 6>There's going to be people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>jive with it.</v>

2108
01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:34.874
<v Speaker 6>There's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>allergic to some of the stuff that's in </v>

2109
01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:39.680
<v Speaker 6>it is going to be people that have weird</v>
<v Speaker 6>biological reactions.</v>

2110
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.180
<v Speaker 6>These are the outliers and like you have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be willing to accept a certain amount</v>

2111
01:35:44.181 --> 01:35:44.810
<v Speaker 6>of outliers.</v>

2112
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:47.570
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to protect people from polio</v>

2113
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 6>and and all these different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy diseases that they've really got a</v>

2114
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:54.140
<v Speaker 6>good grip on measles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Up until recently measles,</v>

2115
01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:56.360
<v Speaker 6>they had it locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody was getting measles anymore,</v>

2116
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:57.343
<v Speaker 6>but all these fucking hippies decided </v>
<v Speaker 6>not to vaccinate their kids and now </v>

2117
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:02.270
<v Speaker 6>measles are coming back because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>worried about autism,</v>

2118
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.060
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time dads are getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>older and older.</v>

2119
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.300
<v Speaker 6>These 54 year old dudes are having </v>
<v Speaker 6>babies and you're like,</v>

2120
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

2121
01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.613
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is way more of your problem than </v>

2122
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.513
<v Speaker 6>probably most vaccinations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As soon as we statistically old sperm </v>

2123
01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.320
<v Speaker 6>mix,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kids will left hands but to vaccinations</v>

2124
01:36:21.321 --> 01:36:24.230
<v Speaker 6>have fuck people up to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like both things are true.</v>

2125
01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.990
<v Speaker 6>Like vaccinations are very important </v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers though.</v>

2126
01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.060
<v Speaker 6>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to look at it and go,</v>

2127
01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:30.060
<v Speaker 6>all right dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2128
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:31.243
<v Speaker 6>but there's also been like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's been a real extensive </v>

2129
01:36:32.961 --> 01:36:33.794
<v Speaker 6>research to disprove the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>vaccinations are the reason for the </v>

2130
01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:37.873
<v Speaker 6>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can understand it just like a </v>

2131
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:42.380
<v Speaker 6>human instinctual way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine you have a baby,</v>

2132
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:43.423
<v Speaker 6>you get your baby vaccinated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing goes more against your </v>

2133
01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:46.664
<v Speaker 6>instincts than to give your baby to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>stranger and let them prick you with </v>

2134
01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:51.563
<v Speaker 6>like everything in you is telling you </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a bad idea and then your kid's </v>

2135
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:56.600
<v Speaker 6>sick over the next year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's very easy.</v>

2136
01:36:56.601 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 6>Just psychologically it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's what fucking happened.</v>

2137
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.020
<v Speaker 4>When I gave him to that guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking prick them.</v>

2138
01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:01.893
<v Speaker 4>That's the reason my son isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumcised was because he was born at </v>

2139
01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:06.180
<v Speaker 4>three in the morning and they were going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it the next day.</v>

2140
01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:09.180
<v Speaker 4>And when I brought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had held him and I loved them.</v>

2141
01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:10.900
<v Speaker 4>I looked at him in the face if they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do it right away,</v>

2142
01:37:10.901 --> 01:37:11.671
<v Speaker 4>I like take them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cut them.</v>

2143
01:37:11.671 --> 01:37:12.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that.</v>

2144
01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.553
<v Speaker 4>But now he hit anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Squeezed at the beginning to have the </v>

2145
01:37:23.821 --> 01:37:28.410
<v Speaker 4>kids had a look at the top of squeezy </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy.</v>

2146
01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:30.720
<v Speaker 4>All you want to do with that pussy </v>
<v Speaker 4>squeeze,</v>

2147
01:37:30.721 --> 01:37:33.720
<v Speaker 4>squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>squeeze my son's fucking head.</v>

2148
01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:36.990
<v Speaker 4>You can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta squeeze it tight.</v>

2149
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ramp head hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came back the next day.</v>

2150
01:37:41.161 --> 01:37:42.360
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we going to take them now?</v>

2151
01:37:42.361 --> 01:37:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had fucking hung out with him.</v>

2152
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:48.030
<v Speaker 4>He's my son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved him at that point so much.</v>

2153
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:52.130
<v Speaker 4>So take me to a strip club already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicken also implanted in my mind all of</v>

2154
01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>these babies circumcision videos where </v>
<v Speaker 4>she made me watch and it's a thing dude.</v>

2155
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's terrible.</v>

2156
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:58.833
<v Speaker 5>It's a barbaric practice that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>only do because it was done to them and </v>

2157
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:03.900
<v Speaker 5>because we feel like it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition and I agree.</v>

2158
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:04.883
<v Speaker 5>They have these bullshit stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bell or goal hope or are you trying to </v>

2159
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:08.783
<v Speaker 5>shut up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not getting HIV that they did </v>

2160
01:38:11.751 --> 01:38:12.584
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did a study in Africa where they </v>

2161
01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:14.304
<v Speaker 5>took like a few hundred people in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking straight up a place in Africa </v>

2162
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:18.054
<v Speaker 5>where it was like one out of every four </v>
<v Speaker 5>people had aids and they proved that </v>

2163
01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:23.760
<v Speaker 5>circumcising them was stopping the </v>
<v Speaker 5>transmission of aids because there's not</v>

2164
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:24.594
<v Speaker 5>as many breaks in the for skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not as easy to transmit the </v>

2165
01:38:26.671 --> 01:38:27.504
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we were talking about a third world </v>

2166
01:38:28.501 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 5>country where they're cleaning their </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies.</v>

2167
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:33.990
<v Speaker 5>We don't live in that same type of </v>
<v Speaker 5>poverty or fucked up like disease.</v>

2168
01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 5>If you look at any of the justifications</v>
<v Speaker 5>for circumcision,</v>

2169
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:40.340
<v Speaker 5>they're all super weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them actually,</v>

2170
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.333
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll say these things where it's </v>

2171
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:41.791
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2172
01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:44.370
<v Speaker 5>you can't get cancer in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your for skin or something like that.</v>

2173
01:38:44.371 --> 01:38:45.150
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2174
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:47.550
<v Speaker 5>and if you just lopped off chicks </v>
<v Speaker 5>breasts,</v>

2175
01:38:47.551 --> 01:38:48.384
<v Speaker 5>they can't get breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're still not going to just </v>

2176
01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.633
<v Speaker 5>preemptively be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just fucking start castrating </v>

2177
01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:58.200
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It changes the sensitivity of your Dick.</v>

2178
01:38:58.201 --> 01:38:59.970
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick supposed to be slippery at the top.</v>

2179
01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while you pull that for skin away,</v>

2180
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 5>it just dries up like an old piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gum.</v>

2181
01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.393
<v Speaker 5>Not supposed to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've lived with literally change with </v>

2182
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 5>Dick's feel like when they go into </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's bodies,</v>

2183
01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:12.533
<v Speaker 5>it is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you describe an uncircumcised Dick </v>

2184
01:39:14.221 --> 01:39:15.054
<v Speaker 5>is self-lubricating you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how they got the business done </v>

2185
01:39:18.571 --> 01:39:19.950
<v Speaker 5>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a,</v>

2186
01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:24.090
<v Speaker 5>but that's the way my Dick Hangs soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could.</v>

2187
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 5>I would hate having for skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd get over it.</v>

2188
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.400
<v Speaker 5>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you rather that or no deck that or</v>

2189
01:39:31.401 --> 01:39:33.800
<v Speaker 5>no deck for a new force come back or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2190
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:34.621
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

2191

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so just let it go too.</v>

2192
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.510
<v Speaker 5>Extreme ends of the rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I live.</v>

2193
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:42.803
<v Speaker 5>If I take it back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I can go back now and </v>

2194
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 5>just write what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just take my.</v>

2195
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:47.720
<v Speaker 5>If a genie came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gas.</v>

2196
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:49.120
<v Speaker 5>Jeanie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric came in and said,</v>

2197
01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:54.520
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna have one wish and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>about your pretty specific wishes back.</v>

2198
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:56.243
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get cut again if you're </v>

2199
01:39:57.911 --> 01:39:58.744
<v Speaker 5>a crazy asshole or they also to do it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>less than it would be your decision </v>

2200
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 5>reconstructive surgery they have for it </v>
<v Speaker 5>to pull shit.</v>

2201
01:40:04.351 --> 01:40:05.570
<v Speaker 5>I've seen what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They take clothes,</v>

2202
01:40:05.571 --> 01:40:09.050
<v Speaker 5>pins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pull your dick apart down,</v>

2203
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:13.390
<v Speaker 5>stretch the skin out around your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it becomes kinda like a forest.</v>

2204
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.310
<v Speaker 5>Like instead of like being one piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>

2205
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.144
<v Speaker 5>it's like a double piece in a rolled up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like ghostface killer webster was </v>

2206
01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 5>hanging in his closet to try to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself taller.</v>

2207
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:26.803
<v Speaker 5>All the grocer shit about four skin is </v>
<v Speaker 5>accentuated by the fact that it's a </v>

2208
01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:31.074
<v Speaker 5>double.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially like the whole skin of </v>

2209
01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:35.820
<v Speaker 5>the deck has to go over the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>deck.</v>

2210
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.780
<v Speaker 5>It's outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did it.</v>

2211
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 5>They did a penn and teller bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

2212
01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's easy.</v>

2213
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:42.623
<v Speaker 5>They're so into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing we should do and </v>

2214
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 5>congratulations to you for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't circumcise your kids anymore.</v>

2215
01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:48.980
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got To stop.</v>

2216
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 5>That's really weird and fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dangerous.</v>

2217
01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 5>It's not 100 percent dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it might</v>

2218
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.813
<v Speaker 3>be one out of a thousand kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get some sort of an infection and they </v>

2219
01:40:56.681 --> 01:40:58.660
<v Speaker 3>could lose their dick that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2220
01:40:58.670 --> 01:40:59.503
<v Speaker 3>and then they do a session that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular thing that happens when it </v>

2221
01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck up their dicks circumcision,</v>

2222
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 3>they get the infection and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2223
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:08.854
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now you can have a baby with no </v>

2224
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:13.150
<v Speaker 3>dick and have it be a boy or we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual sexual reassignment to be a girl.</v>

2225
01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 3>And kids find out years later that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were born a boy.</v>

2226
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:19.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's why that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually a famous case,</v>

2227
01:41:19.571 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a famous case about that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did a botched circumcision.</v>

2228
01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:23.953
<v Speaker 3>The kids penis was removed and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to give him a sexual </v>

2229
01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:29.530
<v Speaker 3>reassignment and everyone was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified of it.</v>

2230
01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid became massively,</v>

2231
01:41:31.721 --> 01:41:34.540
<v Speaker 3>massively depressed and then wound up </v>
<v Speaker 3>committing suicide,</v>

2232
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:39.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an adult and just just felt robbed of</v>

2233
01:41:39.101 --> 01:41:39.910
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

2234
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:41.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by what,</v>

2235
01:41:41.321 --> 01:41:43.090
<v Speaker 3>by some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid,</v>

2236
01:41:43.091 --> 01:41:43.924
<v Speaker 3>avoidable ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to cut baby dicks because </v>

2237
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:48.030
<v Speaker 3>you think it looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2238
01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 3>and in the best case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when all that shit doesn't happen,</v>

2239
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:53.230
<v Speaker 3>you're torturing a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Novacane?</v>

2241
01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:59.350
<v Speaker 3>We're not saying like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if anyone,</v>

2242
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:01.030
<v Speaker 3>if you ever had a surgery like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>

2245
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:07.390
<v Speaker 3>You're so sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know what pain is.</v>

2246
01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Your little tiny one dale person when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's cutting your dick already,</v>

2247

<v Speaker 3>we don't know the type of psychological </v>

2249
01:42:18.311 --> 01:42:21.770
<v Speaker 3>damage that that causes in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real intense pain there in the</v>

2250
01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2251
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.833
<v Speaker 3>They want their mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be held against her mom's </v>

2252
01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:25.060
<v Speaker 3>breast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be feeding with their mom.</v>

01:42:25.061 --> 01:42:25.894
<v Speaker 3>They want the love right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're supposed to get and </v>

2254
01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:30.460
<v Speaker 3>you take them and you fucking mutilate </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2255

<v Speaker 3>Who knows what type of switch you turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in that fucking babies had in that </v>

2256
01:42:34.691 --> 01:42:35.524
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2257

<v Speaker 3>wars.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really good at finance and the diamond </v>

2259
01:42:43.421 --> 01:42:48.421
<v Speaker 3>business and they were like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first people to be circumcised.</v>

2260
01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Like the Jewish people you always assume</v>
<v Speaker 3>were circumcised.</v>

2261
01:42:53.111 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

2262
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.560
<v Speaker 3>It's just part of the code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no.</v>

2263
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:58.623
<v Speaker 3>No one really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any reason where I was trying to save a </v>

<v Speaker 3>the circumcision rituals they do in </v>

2266
01:43:07.241 --> 01:43:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

2267
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.580
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to get a straight </v>

<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really lit and looks like this poor</v>

2284
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:52.913
<v Speaker 6>fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Jewish ceremony where the rabbi </v>

<v Speaker 6>It's not that every Jew doesn't do that,</v>

2288
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:05.380
<v Speaker 6>but there's Dick sucked by a rabbi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2289
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:07.290

2290
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.030

<v Speaker 6>I brought this up three years ago</v>

2291
01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.860
<v Speaker 7>on the show and I'm the only person </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing any research on our show.</v>

2292
01:44:14.861 --> 01:44:15.694
<v Speaker 7>I may seem like I'm the dumbest one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I promise you right now you're </v>

2293
01:44:17.441 --> 01:44:18.740
<v Speaker 7>almost prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dumbest one.</v>

2294
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:21.010
<v Speaker 7>I'm the one doing the research.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I brought this up and everyone looked at</v>

2295
01:44:21.011 --> 01:44:21.940
<v Speaker 7>me like I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm like,</v>

2296
01:44:21.941 --> 01:44:22.601
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I swear to God.</v>

2297
01:44:22.601 --> 01:44:25.480
<v Speaker 7>Rabbis are out there sucking babies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dicks and you guys were your</v>

2298
01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 6>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you justifying it?</v>

2299
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.710
<v Speaker 6>You gave a headline thing because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to.</v>

2300
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 6>There was some serious problems with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oddly enough,</v>

2301
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.753
<v Speaker 6>because of herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because babies were getting herpes and </v>

2302
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:40.130
<v Speaker 6>dying from herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from rabbi sucking their Dick after they</v>

2303
01:44:40.131 --> 01:44:40.964
<v Speaker 6>performed this circumcision and </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently in some versions of Judaism </v>

2304
01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:46.043
<v Speaker 6>it's part of the ritual and that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy was explaining it and like in </v>

2305
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:50.533
<v Speaker 6>Yiddish and he was explaining all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>different things that what's important </v>

2306
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 6>that the rabbi or the WHO have the mo l </v>
<v Speaker 6>performs this.</v>

2307
01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.650
<v Speaker 6>I think he said it to tsetse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had like a word for it.</v>

2308
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you mean the bulls?</v>

2309
01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:04.940
<v Speaker 6>He says a nice old word for sucking baby</v>
<v Speaker 6>dicks.</v>

2310
01:45:04.941 --> 01:45:06.690
<v Speaker 6>You just cut.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

2311
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:11.830
<v Speaker 6>it's so the only in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a youtube video where you're</v>

2312
01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:15.270
<v Speaker 6>dressed like a wizard talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>sucking baby dixit.</v>

2313
01:45:15.271 --> 01:45:15.950
<v Speaker 6>You just cut and.</v>

2314
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:16.783
<v Speaker 6>Well this is a part of our tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but do you think it's an argument like </v>

2315
01:45:19.661 --> 01:45:24.350
<v Speaker 6>you're not just some fucking like dress </v>
<v Speaker 6>and like making like singing some song.</v>

2316
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:25.990
<v Speaker 6>You're actually going like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well this is what I have to.</v>

2317
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's definitely sinister?</v>

2318
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:30.700
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's retarded always.</v>

2319
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:31.543
<v Speaker 6>Or is it just like it's fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're stuck in it and someone did it </v>

2320
01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:35.324
<v Speaker 6>to him and someone did it to his dad and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they feel like they're a part of this </v>

2321
01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:39.080
<v Speaker 6>clan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking.</v>

2322
01:45:39.081 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 6>And you feel like if you were to give up</v>
<v Speaker 6>on that,</v>

2323
01:45:40.941 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 6>you're giving up on your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your family.</v>

2324
01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:43.763
<v Speaker 6>Everything's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you got to just blindly believe that </v>

2325
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:49.070
<v Speaker 6>this is what you did to retard the </v>
<v Speaker 6>progress.</v>

2326
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.290
<v Speaker 6>It retards progress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

2327
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.330
<v Speaker 6>It literally is retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in that sense,</v>

2328
01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:56.060
<v Speaker 6>like forget about the derogatory term </v>
<v Speaker 6>you used for people.</v>

2329
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 6>It's a retarded idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It retards logic.</v>

2330
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:03.650
<v Speaker 6>You're cutting a baby dick and sucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>on it.</v>

2331
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:05.960
<v Speaker 6>Then you're making a youtube video </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>

2332
01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when we thought the world was flat,</v>

2333
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:08.623
<v Speaker 6>this is how we do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We still do it this way and we like to </v>

2334
01:46:10.461 --> 01:46:13.790
<v Speaker 6>cut it and we like to fuck when we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>a name for it.</v>

2335
01:46:13.791 --> 01:46:17.420
<v Speaker 6>It's not that I make with my mouth </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's different than sucking cut baby.</v>

2336
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:22.940
<v Speaker 6>I've judged is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A rose by any other name I say.</v>

2337
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.053
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was crazy that someone could </v>

2338
01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:31.130
<v Speaker 6>sit around and justify doing some shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>to a baby's deck.</v>

2339
01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:31.964
<v Speaker 6>Just because they've always done it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think all but two have Jackie </v>

2340
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:39.610
<v Speaker 6>Mason to it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a reasonable rate.</v>

2341
01:46:40.670 --> 01:46:41.503
<v Speaker 6>Just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean is if it's any better to cut it </v>

2342
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:44.744
<v Speaker 6>and not suck it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like at least maybe it feels better for </v>

2343
01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:47.580
<v Speaker 6>the kid to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>

2344
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to stick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>give a blowjob</v>

2345
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.083
<v Speaker 3>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would definitely want somebody to </v>

2346
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:53.730
<v Speaker 3>suck your Dick after you got to cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how,</v>

2347
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a person just sucks baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks all the time.</v>

2348
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Like how many baby you took an average </v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbi.</v>

01:48:39.121 --> 01:48:39.954
<v Speaker 3>watching their families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies getting their dicks cut and then </v>

2385
01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:42.414
<v Speaker 3>such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also a whole set of </v>

2386
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:45.263
<v Speaker 3>pedophile vampires that are watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and just beating off to it all day </v>

<v Speaker 3>This is not a Jewish religion.</v>

2397

<v Speaker 3>We're not living in the barbarian times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but today people are cutting in sucking </v>

2398
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.473

01:49:54.941 --> 01:49:55.774
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stayed off every year and I'm not </v>

2410
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:59.950
<v Speaker 3>saying Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't play in traffic.</v>

2411
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not going to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't need to say anything.</v>

2414
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin is handling it for all of us.</v>

2415
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Women's history month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hispanic Saturday,</v>

2416
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:14.290
<v Speaker 3>March 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First we're celebrating.</v>

2417
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 3>So this is women's history month.</v>

2418
01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.300
<v Speaker 3>The fucked up thing is black history </v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

2419
01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:21.080
<v Speaker 3>The shortest month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:23.320
<v Speaker 3>That was definitely some passive </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive racist shit.</v>

2421
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Percent hundred percent keep dam an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra bone in the wreck.</v>

2422
01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.673
<v Speaker 3>What makes them history harder?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like at what point in time is that </v>

2423
01:50:35.771 --> 01:50:37.490
<v Speaker 3>going to end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>

2424
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:38.343
<v Speaker 3>how long in the future would it be </v>
<v Speaker 3>before we didn't have black history </v>

2425
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:41.763
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not going to have like a </v>

2426
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Moore's history month for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2427
01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.553
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying black people are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go extinct at a certain point and we </v>

2428
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:49.174
<v Speaker 3>won't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all people are going to go </v>

2429
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:51.184
<v Speaker 3>extinct at a certain point and I pray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's probably within a thousand </v>

2430
01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.660
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think so.</v>

2431
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:58.780
<v Speaker 3>I hope you don't feel are months like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking frat parties.</v>

2432
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 3>That's true too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think like what point in time</v>

2433
01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:04.740
<v Speaker 3>we're going to not care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you.</v>

2434
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:05.943
<v Speaker 3>If there's a way like let's just imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it even humanly possible to engineer </v>

2435
01:51:10.601 --> 01:51:13.180
<v Speaker 3>the education of human beings to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where there's no more.</v>

2436
01:51:13.181 --> 01:51:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Racism doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more sexism,</v>

2437
01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:17.483
<v Speaker 3>no more homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naturally we were tribes and we </v>

2438
01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 3>gravitate toward people that look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>us and we're comfortable with.</v>

2439
01:51:23.021 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I remember in kindergarten shore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 1987,</v>

2440
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.753
<v Speaker 3>we were allowed to just choose our </v>
<v Speaker 3>tables because it didn't make you sit </v>

2441
01:51:30.551 --> 01:51:31.384
<v Speaker 3>where you no assigned seats or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember all the white kids just </v>

2442
01:51:34.241 --> 01:51:35.074
<v Speaker 3>sat with the white kids and the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids sit with the black kids and </v>

2443
01:51:36.371 --> 01:51:37.204
<v Speaker 3>Hispanic and says with the Hispanic kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm half white and I was raised by </v>

2444
01:51:39.191 --> 01:51:40.024
<v Speaker 3>white people and you see little Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rican may just plopped in the middle of </v>

2445
01:51:42.251 --> 01:51:44.280
<v Speaker 3>this white table and all these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids probably like,</v>

2446
01:51:44.281 --> 01:51:45.370
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this kid doing here?</v>

2447
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:46.443
<v Speaker 3>But it was very much like everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>segregated racially and it was very </v>

2448
01:51:49.391 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a kid.</v>

2449
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about as a grown adult who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>already examined the world,</v>

2450
01:51:53.111 --> 01:51:53.944
<v Speaker 3>don't you think it's possible to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to the point where they don't do </v>

2451
01:51:55.511 --> 01:51:57.070
<v Speaker 3>that anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just let it go.</v>

2452
01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:57.993
<v Speaker 3>I think individuals can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that in terms of large </v>

2453
01:52:00.401 --> 01:52:01.234
<v Speaker 3>demographic groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there won't be any in group preference </v>

2454
01:52:03.281 --> 01:52:06.370
<v Speaker 3>and there won't be any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm not closed off to it,</v>

2455
01:52:06.371 --> 01:52:09.280
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like a real tough goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100 percent,</v>

2456
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:10.114
<v Speaker 3>but I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more leaning towards that now than </v>

2457
01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 3>ever before because of the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think people are accelerating,</v>

2458
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 3>accelerating what they understand about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the world.</v>

2459
01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:20.133
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more deep like for you've </v>

2460
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:25.390
<v Speaker 3>talked to average 20 year old today and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just way more knowledgeable than</v>

2461
01:52:25.391 --> 01:52:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I was when I was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stunningly.</v>

2462
01:52:27.521 --> 01:52:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So like even if they believe ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2463
01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:30.870
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2464
01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:31.723
<v Speaker 3>because they have the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because it's like if I like it </v>

2465
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.550
<v Speaker 3>for me to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know half the shit.</v>

2466
01:52:36.551 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 3>I know if I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2467
01:52:38.141 --> 01:52:38.974
<v Speaker 3>decades before I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to go to the library </v>

2468
01:52:40.481 --> 01:52:42.710
<v Speaker 3>every fucking care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2469
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I wasn't going to put that in,</v>

2470
01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>but when it's right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

2471
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.641
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

2472
01:52:46.641 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 7>well I guess I can spend two to 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 7>AM,</v>

2473
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:54.200
<v Speaker 7>but I think we're going towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seems like the sharing of information</v>

2474
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:55.940
<v Speaker 7>is sort of making us move away from </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2475
01:52:55.941 --> 01:53:00.170
<v Speaker 7>It seems like it's making us more </v>
<v Speaker 7>erratic and more kind of crazy.</v>

2476
01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.490
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like we don't know how to like,</v>

2477
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:02.663
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people don't know how to quickly share </v>

2478
01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:07.280
<v Speaker 7>an idea and deal with people reacting to</v>
<v Speaker 7>that idea.</v>

2479
01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.490
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as fast as it's happening.</v>

2480
01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.290
<v Speaker 7>I think it's creating a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that are,</v>

2481
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:13.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we speak of friends who like,</v>

2482
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.593
<v Speaker 7>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>owning each other on facebook and </v>

2483
01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 7>publicly been like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck you dude,</v>

2484
01:53:16.521 --> 01:53:18.320
<v Speaker 7>if you believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't ever want to talk to you again.</v>

2485
01:53:18.321 --> 01:53:18.771
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

2486
01:53:18.771 --> 01:53:19.604
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where am I supposed to talk about some </v>

2487
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 7>of the Shit I thought whatever happen to</v>
<v Speaker 7>like water cooler conversation.</v>

2488
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.533
<v Speaker 7>You weren't supposed to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 7>politics or religion or any of this </v>

2489
01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:25.664
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're kind of supposed to just leave </v>

2490
01:53:26.671 --> 01:53:27.504
<v Speaker 7>each other's lives and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and sort of like live with each other </v>

2491
01:53:30.651 --> 01:53:31.220
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2492
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:31.851
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember thinking about this when the,</v>

2494
01:53:33.261 --> 01:53:35.300
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the thing with a chick filet,</v>

2495
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:37.520
<v Speaker 7>which by the way is delicious,</v>

2575
01:56:58.831 --> 01:56:59.664
<v Speaker 3>in every generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to just experience that a </v>

2576

<v Speaker 3>little bit and know what that's about.</v>

2578
01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:06.803
<v Speaker 3>Just like when I get like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterculture movement first happened </v>

2579
01:57:09.971 --> 01:57:14.050
<v Speaker 3>and like music was just awesome and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the late sixties was like,</v>

2580
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.610
<v Speaker 3>that was just like a cool time to be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2581
01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.453
<v Speaker 3>But I have fat thighs so I could never </v>
<v Speaker 3>wear the pants that were available from </v>

2582
01:57:18.561 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 3>it at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2585
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:28.680
<v Speaker 3>That was tougher to do in the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sixties before the Internet.</v>

2586
01:57:28.681 --> 01:57:30.660
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't find your specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very true.</v>

2587
01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 3>What's up with people that want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to those arrows so bad.</v>

2591
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's like purposely bad artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to mimic a time period,</v>

2592
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:56.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's like your body is not a museum </v>

<v Speaker 4>It was a lot of people in la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New York,</v>

2655
02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:41.590

<v Speaker 4>but you were just trying to fit into </v>

2657
02:00:43.781 --> 02:00:44.660
<v Speaker 4>that girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2658
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's all the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2659
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.850
<v Speaker 4>You're just high school and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>nominated.</v>

2660
02:00:48.851 --> 02:00:49.684
<v Speaker 4>We're not goth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was borderline goth in high </v>

2661
02:00:50.951 --> 02:00:55.951
<v Speaker 4>school can be borderline goth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was because there was a goth kids.</v>

2662
02:00:57.841 --> 02:00:59.800
<v Speaker 4>It didn't really accept me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on the spectrum.</v>

2663
02:00:59.801 --> 02:01:04.801
<v Speaker 4>You've got spectrum three five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I used to wear,</v>

2664
02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 4>like Marilyn Manson tee shirts and I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>long hair and eyeliner,</v>

2665
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:09.383
<v Speaker 4>Europe of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the goth kids weren't really like </v>

2666
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:12.970
<v Speaker 4>taken in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were those my crew.</v>

2667
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2668

<v Speaker 4>the mall that shop at hot topic.</v>

2671
02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:26.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a big problem with young people </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be a part of something.</v>

2672
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:27.363

<v Speaker 6>when he was 14 and here he is now in his</v>

2678

<v Speaker 6>Like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It isn't really not even whether or not </v>

2683
02:02:04.911 --> 02:02:05.744

<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2721
02:03:40.141 --> 02:03:42.200
<v Speaker 6>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell the story.</v>

2722
02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 6>So more or less.</v>

2723
02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.753
<v Speaker 6>In Maryland there was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a school shooting or a kid </v>

2724
02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:48.050
<v Speaker 6>came into school with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they had an armed security guard.</v>

2725
02:03:48.051 --> 02:03:49.340
<v Speaker 6>He took them out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody died.</v>

2726
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:50.203
<v Speaker 6>Military Training Guy got rid of him </v>
<v Speaker 6>quick and that's what the NRA advocates </v>

2727
02:03:54.771 --> 02:03:56.330
<v Speaker 6>are saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2728
02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:57.830
<v Speaker 6>this is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We should.</v>

2729
02:03:57.860 --> 02:03:58.693
<v Speaker 6>We should have someone who's an armed </v>
<v Speaker 6>and ready responder at the school to </v>

2730
02:04:03.051 --> 02:04:06.500
<v Speaker 6>prevent this kind of shit from happening</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's a lot of veterans that would</v>

2731
02:04:06.501 --> 02:04:07.334
<v Speaker 6>take that job happily and you would have</v>
<v Speaker 6>your kids 100 percent safe and people </v>

2732
02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:12.351
<v Speaker 6>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2733
02:04:12.351 --> 02:04:14.540
<v Speaker 6>that's not the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The solution is take the guns away.</v>

2734
02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't like the idea of armed security </v>
<v Speaker 6>at school.</v>

2735
02:04:18.471 --> 02:04:19.304
<v Speaker 6>I don't like the idea of doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like the idea of arming </v>

2736
02:04:21.291 --> 02:04:22.124
<v Speaker 6>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like to just dismiss that and </v>

2737
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:25.034
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no gun control.</v>

2738
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 6>The only reasonable measure I think is </v>
<v Speaker 6>naive.</v>

2739
02:04:27.621 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 6>But just to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you were saying before,</v>

2740
02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:30.710
<v Speaker 6>I have no problem with people being </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2741
02:04:30.711 --> 02:04:32.990
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cnn shouldn't just be putting these kids</v>

2742
02:04:32.991 --> 02:04:33.824
<v Speaker 6>on without having someone to rebut it or</v>
<v Speaker 6>they shouldn't be putting this on and </v>

2743
02:04:36.171 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 6>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to go at the</v>

2744
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.780
<v Speaker 5>kid and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2745
02:04:39.781 --> 02:04:41.060
<v Speaker 5>this kid's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2746
02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:43.650
<v Speaker 5>just milking this experience like </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2747
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Any of us would do a thing like that.</v>

2748
02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:46.840
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2749
02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2750
02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:49.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have a horse in the race.</v>

2751
02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:50.214
<v Speaker 7>I don't really give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't really shoot guns and I know </v>

2752
02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 7>he's the only one I've shot guns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just been really fun.</v>

2753
02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 7>There's no part of me that like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I would swallow it a little more</v>

2754
02:04:56.701 --> 02:05:00.360
<v Speaker 7>of people that like were really a big </v>
<v Speaker 7>gun advocates,</v>

2755
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of admit that like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

2756
02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want to blow shit up.</v>

2757
02:05:03.330 --> 02:05:04.530
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2758
02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:05.733
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you get this other sort of thing </v>

2759
02:05:06.841 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 7>where I just think that you should have </v>
<v Speaker 7>people that are really trained,</v>

2760
02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.193
<v Speaker 7>really responsible and we should have </v>
<v Speaker 7>specific measures in place in order and </v>

2761
02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:15.594
<v Speaker 7>I know we do have that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but maybe we should look at it and push </v>

2762
02:05:17.461 --> 02:05:19.710
<v Speaker 7>that line back even a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 7>because yeah,</v>

2763
02:05:19.711 --> 02:05:21.300
<v Speaker 7>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even in the example of the dude,</v>

2764
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:22.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>taking out that kid in that school,</v>

2765
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.233
<v Speaker 7>I don't necessarily have an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 7>having an armed security guard at the </v>

2766
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:26.664
<v Speaker 7>school to protect children,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I kind of have an issue with </v>

2767
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:29.784
<v Speaker 7>somebody who you don't know when his </v>
<v Speaker 7>girlfriend broke up with him and when </v>

2768
02:05:32.821 --> 02:05:34.200
<v Speaker 7>this dude went bat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2769
02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.930
<v Speaker 7>So even when you have to get people's </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychological exams,</v>

2770
02:05:36.931 --> 02:05:37.764
<v Speaker 7>like when do they go crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When is there a moment where somebody </v>

2771
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:40.250
<v Speaker 7>snaps and now they're fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2772
02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:41.133
<v Speaker 7>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm</v>

2773
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 5>really against gun control of just about</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind.</v>

2774
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:47.010
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually think when people,</v>

2775
02:05:47.011 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times Republicans will go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not about gun control,</v>

2776
02:05:49.771 --> 02:05:50.604
<v Speaker 5>it's about mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's even more of a copout </v>

2777
02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:53.573
<v Speaker 5>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you even saying by </v>

2778
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:55.660
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you,</v>

2779
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's lots of,</v>

2780
02:05:56.670 --> 02:05:57.503
<v Speaker 5>when you say mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's lots of people who </v>

2781
02:05:59.191 --> 02:06:01.890
<v Speaker 5>suffer from anxiety and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these things.</v>

2782
02:06:01.891 --> 02:06:03.600
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean they're a risk to </v>
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>

2783
02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you actually going to say?</v>

2784
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:06.024
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm for unfettered gun rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everyone has to have like a </v>

2785
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:10.374
<v Speaker 5>psychological exam and it's as if </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some way that we can predict </v>

2786
02:06:12.991 --> 02:06:14.610
<v Speaker 5>who's going to shoot up a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

2787
02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.280
<v Speaker 5>And the truth of the matter is it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really fucking tough.</v>

2788
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:18.303
<v Speaker 5>It definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what you're saying is entirely </v>

2789
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:23.430
<v Speaker 5>correct because it is absolutely about </v>
<v Speaker 5>mental health and you have to be fucking</v>

2790
02:06:23.431 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 5>crazy to be a school shooter.</v>

2791
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:25.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And most of these people are on some </v>

2792
02:06:27.451 --> 02:06:31.020
<v Speaker 5>sort of psychiatric medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a giant percentage of them.</v>

2793
02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.033
<v Speaker 5>So it is in fact a mental health issue </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there are there literally on </v>

2794
02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:35.813
<v Speaker 5>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the vast percentage of them are on </v>

2795
02:06:37.951 --> 02:06:38.784
<v Speaker 5>mental health medication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the question is whether or not it's </v>

2796
02:06:42.271 --> 02:06:43.104
<v Speaker 5>the mental health medication that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>causing them to do this shit or whether </v>

2797
02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 5>or not they were already crazy and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>medication was just trying to treat this</v>

2798
02:06:49.711 --> 02:06:52.530
<v Speaker 5>disease and they got ahold of guns and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem is the guns.</v>

2799
02:06:52.531 --> 02:06:53.364
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe I didn't say that like </v>

2800
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 5>precisely enough because I agree with </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything you just said.</v>

2801
02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm just making the point that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's like,</v>

2802
02:06:57.930 --> 02:06:58.763
<v Speaker 5>oh all we know is that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 5>category of people who have mental </v>

2803
02:07:00.541 --> 02:07:03.510
<v Speaker 5>health issues and they shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to get guns is way too broad.</v>

2804
02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:04.531
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

2805
02:07:04.531 --> 02:07:07.140
<v Speaker 5>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you mentioned earlier,</v>

2806
02:07:07.141 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 5>it's like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say these.</v>

2807
02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:09.923
<v Speaker 5>Anyone who's real fucked up nowadays as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of mental health issues a lot and </v>

2808
02:07:13.501 --> 02:07:15.330
<v Speaker 5>is in school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to put them on trucks.</v>

2809
02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 5>They put anyone who's borderline on </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

2810
02:07:17.161 --> 02:07:17.994
<v Speaker 5>So the really fucked up kids on like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cocktail of drugs and no admit with a </v>

2811
02:07:21.181 --> 02:07:22.014
<v Speaker 5>lot of these antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anti psychotics that they can cause </v>

2812
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.673
<v Speaker 5>suicidal tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of you will even say they cause </v>

2813
02:07:28.021 --> 02:07:28.854
<v Speaker 5>homicidal tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's pretty reasonable that </v>

2814
02:07:32.191 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 5>maybe in some very small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them they cause you to just fucking</v>

2815
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.083
<v Speaker 3>want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they push you at least in the </v>

2816
02:07:38.081 --> 02:07:38.914
<v Speaker 3>direction of wanting to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shoot up a bunch of people to </v>

2817
02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:41.923
<v Speaker 3>relief the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relieve you of the feeling of </v>

2818
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2819
02:07:45.161 --> 02:07:45.994
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they disassociate you from whatever </v>

2820
02:07:47.531 --> 02:07:48.364
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the most disconcerting </v>

2821
02:07:50.981 --> 02:07:51.814
<v Speaker 3>things about the idea that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>has homicidal thoughts but they're </v>

2822
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:55.294
<v Speaker 3>keeping them at bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they take some pill that </v>

2823
02:07:57.161 --> 02:07:57.910
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2824
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:59.080
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

2825
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not exercising the whatever,</v>

2826
02:08:02.171 --> 02:08:06.160
<v Speaker 3>the mental processes of not killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on your own.</v>

2827
02:08:06.190 --> 02:08:08.500
<v Speaker 3>You need this thing to do it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have your medication.</v>

2828
02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 3>One day I heard you talk about this the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day was kind of interesting.</v>

2829
02:08:10.601 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I forget who was on people whose metzker</v>
<v Speaker 3>or somebody,</v>

2830
02:08:13.271 --> 02:08:15.520
<v Speaker 3>but you were talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was very calm,</v>

2831
02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:18.590
<v Speaker 3>cool and collected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxed on that episode.</v>

2832
02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:19.870
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best,</v>

2833
02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:20.704
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best advertisement for Caveman </v>

2834
02:08:22.031 --> 02:08:25.420
<v Speaker 3>nitrile you could possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will make you into a raving madman.</v>

2835
02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.030
<v Speaker 3>The Maryland school shooter was killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by his own bullet,</v>

2836
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:30.660
<v Speaker 3>not the school resource officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police said,</v>

2837
02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shot himself in the head when the guy</v>

2838
02:08:33.041 --> 02:08:34.100
<v Speaker 3>was coming after him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2839
02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.130
<v Speaker 3>But still kind of a similar moral of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story that maybe the guy behind him made</v>

2840
02:08:39.131 --> 02:08:41.830
<v Speaker 3>him shoot himself and this is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same story.</v>

2841
02:08:41.831 --> 02:08:44.050
<v Speaker 3>The story was that this arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God took him out.</v>

2842
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.071
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>

2843
02:08:45.071 --> 02:08:47.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I had heard.</v>

2844
02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.113
<v Speaker 3>I had heard a deceptive version of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>then because I heard that this guy </v>

2845
02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:55.390
<v Speaker 3>engaged in a firefight with this kid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed him instantly.</v>

2846
02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I read.</v>

2847
02:08:56.561 --> 02:08:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Like six different articles that said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2848
02:08:59.230 --> 02:08:59.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2849
02:08:59.891 --> 02:09:02.530
<v Speaker 3>So that maybe that's incorrect or </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too many things to pay attention</v>

2850
02:09:02.531 --> 02:09:03.364
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2851
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Is a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit the shooters gun in his hand.</v>

2852
02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>His shot hit the shooters gun before </v>
<v Speaker 3>having to shoot.</v>

2853
02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Shoot her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot himself.</v>

2854
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:15.940
<v Speaker 3>He shot himself with a gun that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

2855
02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 3>I said the officer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the officer shot struck rollins gun,</v>

2856
02:09:18.881 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 3>which was in the teens hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sheriff's office said,</v>

2857
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:23.920
<v Speaker 3>nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his quick action confronting rollins.</v>

2858
02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Just three minutes after the shot to </v>
<v Speaker 3>students has been credited with bringing</v>

2859
02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 3>the incident to a quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the guy did shoot the kid.</v>

2860
02:09:29.951 --> 02:09:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2861
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 3>he hit his gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killed him.</v>

2862
02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

2863
02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.340
<v Speaker 3>he shot him and then when the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After the guy shot him,</v>

2864
02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:38.540
<v Speaker 3>he just shot himself while he's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>could praise.</v>

2865
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Praise came even when it was unclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>which shot killed the teen,</v>

2866
02:09:44.730 --> 02:09:46.810
<v Speaker 3>but he definitely seems like he shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2867
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in the fire.</v>

2868
02:09:47.890 --> 02:09:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He really wasn't a firefight with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy.</v>

2869
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:51.621
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2870
02:09:51.621 --> 02:09:52.454
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's not a single answer to </v>

2871
02:09:54.251 --> 02:09:56.200
<v Speaker 3>any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is definitely a mental health</v>

2872
02:09:56.201 --> 02:09:57.460
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're not gonna.</v>

2873
02:09:57.490 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's gonna come up with a law that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to figure all this shit out.</v>

2874
02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:02.260
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't live.</v>

2875
02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.080
<v Speaker 3>I joked about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2876
02:10:04.081 --> 02:10:04.914
<v Speaker 3>I kind of lived my life in a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorance is bliss state with this type </v>

2877
02:10:07.811 --> 02:10:09.190
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2878
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2879
02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I have to guess my kid's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot to death in a school one day.</v>

2880
02:10:15.130 --> 02:10:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Knock on wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2881
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:16.631
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2882
02:10:16.631 --> 02:10:17.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible thing.</v>

2883
02:10:18.570 --> 02:10:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is I don't know if these</v>

2884
02:10:20.501 --> 02:10:21.334
<v Speaker 3>people that are so obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and just they're making it </v>

2885
02:10:22.991 --> 02:10:23.824
<v Speaker 3>their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel like they're kind of </v>

2886
02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:26.930
<v Speaker 3>missing the point if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2887
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:27.833
<v Speaker 3>my kid isn't gonna be out at a rally </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding a sign and I'm not spending my </v>

2888
02:10:29.711 --> 02:10:30.544
<v Speaker 3>days doing that with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm spending my days creating memories </v>

2889
02:10:32.021 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 3>with him and just trying to spend my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life making a good life</v>

2890
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.920
<v Speaker 7>and I'm not really politicizing anything</v>
<v Speaker 7>with my five year old.</v>

2891
02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.240
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2892
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 6>there's people that feel like they want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do something to want change.</v>

2893
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:44.150
<v Speaker 6>They don't want this to happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you lost your kid,</v>

2894
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:45.950
<v Speaker 6>he'd probably feel that way to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2895
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.701
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>

2896
02:10:46.701 --> 02:10:47.534
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's way too many of these things is </v>

2897
02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 6>way too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we got to figure out what it is.</v>

2898
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 6>I think the real issue resolved realize </v>
<v Speaker 6>rather,</v>

2899
02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:54.860
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2900
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 6>it lies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's one,</v>

2901
02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:56.953
<v Speaker 6>one giant part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's looking at the final piece </v>

2902
02:10:59.841 --> 02:11:01.820
<v Speaker 6>of the puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the final piece of the puzzle.</v>

2903
02:11:01.821 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 6>It all comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is the school shooting?</v>

2904
02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:08.740
<v Speaker 6>What gets someone to that position?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do they get to that?</v>

2905
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 6>You gotta go to step one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not to step 10.</v>

2906
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:14.540
<v Speaker 6>Step 10 is a school shooting you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa.</v>

2907
02:11:14.541 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 6>Figure out how do we get less people to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go from step one to step two?</v>

2908
02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 6>How do we keep more people happy as </v>
<v Speaker 6>young people?</v>

2909
02:11:21.051 --> 02:11:21.884
<v Speaker 6>How do we give more people support </v>
<v Speaker 6>headed when we give more people therapy </v>

2910
02:11:24.801 --> 02:11:25.634
<v Speaker 6>or exercise or recreation or friendship </v>
<v Speaker 6>or community guidance or whatever the </v>

2911
02:11:29.571 --> 02:11:30.404
<v Speaker 6>fuck we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where we alienate people to the point </v>

2912
02:11:32.031 --> 02:11:34.370
<v Speaker 6>where they literally want to go and </v>
<v Speaker 6>shoot everybody else.</v>

2913
02:11:34.371 --> 02:11:35.400
<v Speaker 6>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2914
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:39.710
<v Speaker 6>the physical equivalent of like flipping</v>
<v Speaker 6>over a game when you're losing,</v>

2915
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:40.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2916
02:11:40.710 --> 02:11:41.421
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2917
02:11:41.421 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 6>that's a great analogy by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's exactly what it is.</v>

2918
02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.051
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2919
02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:47.360
<v Speaker 6>this world is so bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well Fuck,</v>

2920
02:11:47.370 --> 02:11:50.390
<v Speaker 6>you can make it for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that.</v>

2921
02:11:50.391 --> 02:11:51.224
<v Speaker 6>Nice teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've thought I completely agree with </v>

2922
02:11:52.491 --> 02:11:54.770
<v Speaker 6>what you're saying and I think maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 6>silver lining in this,</v>

2923
02:11:54.771 --> 02:11:55.604
<v Speaker 6>like the best thing that could come out </v>
<v Speaker 6>of this and it has nothing to do with </v>

2924
02:11:57.351 --> 02:11:58.184
<v Speaker 6>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is just that kids in high school will </v>

2925
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:01.333
<v Speaker 6>think twice before they're brutally </v>
<v Speaker 6>ostracizing some other kid because </v>

2926
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:05.000
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2927
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.810
<v Speaker 6>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That kid might be the one who</v>

2928
02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:11.200
<v Speaker 7>maybe not people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kids think they're invincible.</v>

2929
02:12:11.201 --> 02:12:12.880
<v Speaker 7>They're not thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember when I,</v>

2930
02:12:13.090 --> 02:12:13.923
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>columbine was so such a big news story </v>

2931
02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:17.290
<v Speaker 7>when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was in high school,</v>

2932
02:12:17.291 --> 02:12:19.600
<v Speaker 7>I believe at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure.</v>

2933
02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:20.441
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's your birthday.</v>

2934
02:12:20.441 --> 02:12:25.441
<v Speaker 7>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My birthday real fucked up and dude,</v>

2935
02:12:26.321 --> 02:12:28.020
<v Speaker 7>it was fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was such a big deal.</v>

2936
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:30.460
<v Speaker 7>I had never seen anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>

2937
02:12:30.810 --> 02:12:32.080
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is before nine slash 11.</v>

2938
02:12:32.081 --> 02:12:34.000
<v Speaker 7>Nine slash 11 was the next big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>big thing.</v>

2939
02:12:34.330 --> 02:12:38.560
<v Speaker 7>But it happens so often now that because</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the Internet,</v>

2940
02:12:38.561 --> 02:12:39.394
<v Speaker 7>I almost feel like people are also </v>
<v Speaker 7>desensitized to like how crazy it was </v>

2941
02:12:42.161 --> 02:12:42.994
<v Speaker 7>because columbine dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was bizarre watching the images on </v>

2942
02:12:45.911 --> 02:12:47.830
<v Speaker 7>the news of the people of running out of</v>
<v Speaker 7>that school.</v>

2943
02:12:47.831 --> 02:12:48.664
<v Speaker 7>It was like haunting and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 7>watching it and my mom made this point </v>

2944
02:12:50.951 --> 02:12:52.750
<v Speaker 7>and shoot my mom a fucking drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lunatic.</v>

2945
02:12:52.751 --> 02:12:53.584
<v Speaker 7>But she had these weird little moments </v>
<v Speaker 7>in her life when she said some crazy </v>

2946
02:12:55.601 --> 02:12:56.890
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And she was like,</v>

2947
02:12:56.891 --> 02:12:57.331
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She like,</v>

2948
02:12:57.331 --> 02:12:57.851
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2949
02:12:57.851 --> 02:13:00.520
<v Speaker 7>maybe they shouldn't have fucked with </v>
<v Speaker 7>those kids just in a weird way.</v>

2950
02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:01.810
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh damn,</v>

2951
02:13:01.811 --> 02:13:04.480
<v Speaker 7>I'm really good at defending these like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you just kinda.</v>

2952
02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.820
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't defending the active people </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting killed,</v>

2953
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:09.790
<v Speaker 7>but it was sort of looking at the root </v>
<v Speaker 7>with which is what you're saying.</v>

2954
02:13:09.791 --> 02:13:10.630
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and she,</v>

2955
02:13:10.650 --> 02:13:11.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she's kind of made that point.</v>

2956
02:13:11.861 --> 02:13:12.910
<v Speaker 7>I kind of always stuck with me</v>

2957
02:13:13.590 --> 02:13:15.810
<v Speaker 6>even more than like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I get the point,</v>

2958
02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.220
<v Speaker 6>but even more than other kids bullying </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

2959
02:13:17.221 --> 02:13:19.440
<v Speaker 6>The truth is if you want to get it the </v>
<v Speaker 6>route you want to be like,</v>

2960
02:13:19.441 --> 02:13:20.274
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>parents fucking love your kids and give </v>

2961
02:13:22.141 --> 02:13:24.030
<v Speaker 6>them a really good childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's like,</v>

2962
02:13:24.031 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 6>how do you actually make that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a narrative,</v>

2963
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:29.820
<v Speaker 6>difficult natural inclination that </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals have to pick on the weaker ones.</v>

2964
02:13:29.821 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 6>It's a terrible natural of the human </v>
<v Speaker 6>beings have to avoid because chickens do</v>

2965
02:13:34.471 --> 02:13:35.250
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've chickens,</v>

2966
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:35.941
<v Speaker 6>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

2967
02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:38.780
<v Speaker 6>With the smaller chickens and the less </v>
<v Speaker 6>aggressive chickens,</v>

2968
02:13:38.781 --> 02:13:40.710
<v Speaker 6>they fucked them up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have a pecking order.</v>

2969
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.823
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it with dogs would one dog </v>

2970
02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 6>becomes the alpha of the pack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>takes over,</v>

2971
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 6>dominates the other dogs is a natural </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2972
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:48.203
<v Speaker 6>It's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's natural in every single animal </v>

2973
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:51.114
<v Speaker 6>community and it's natural with people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we're smart and we understand the </v>

2974
02:13:54.301 --> 02:13:57.840
<v Speaker 6>consequences of that and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 6>give those kids a reason to not do that,</v>

2975
02:13:58.210 --> 02:13:59.043
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's also the problem with like </v>

2976
02:14:00.151 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to school with Lebron </v>
<v Speaker 6>James,</v>

2977
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like standing next to this fucking giant</v>

2978
02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:06.260
<v Speaker 6>super athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

2979
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kinda bullshit.</v>

2980
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 6>Genetic roll the dice that I can get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This motherfucker got all aces.</v>

2981
02:14:11.941 --> 02:14:14.670
<v Speaker 6>He's got five aces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like seven feet tall.</v>

2982
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 6>He weighs 300 pounds and he moves like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>pant.</v>

2983
02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:20.600
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no basis to win.</v>

2984
02:14:20.610 --> 02:14:22.770
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that analogy specifically because</v>

2985
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:24.233
<v Speaker 4>it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a tattoo on my arm and it's just </v>

2986
02:14:25.381 --> 02:14:27.410
<v Speaker 4>a to seven off suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a poker player,</v>

2987
02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the analogy.</v>

2988
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it off.</v>

2989
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:30.260
<v Speaker 4>Take that tattoo man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2990
02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:32.390
<v Speaker 4>It's such to such a bad client.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2991
02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:33.600
<v Speaker 4>you have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2992
02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst and you thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing anything about it.</v>

2993
02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.790
<v Speaker 4>I have one cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have one that says Lou dog.</v>

2994
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:40.060
<v Speaker 4>My first one ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

2995
02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:43.410
<v Speaker 4>nobody even call me Lou dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just did sarcastically.</v>

2996
02:14:43.411 --> 02:14:48.411
<v Speaker 4>After I got that nickname it introducing</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself a nickname.</v>

2997
02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.030
<v Speaker 4>I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2998
02:14:54.031 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I need a tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What can I get in my mind?</v>

2999
02:14:56.161 --> 02:14:56.994
<v Speaker 4>Could only go to Lou dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the juiciest thing a </v>

3000
02:14:58.801 --> 02:14:59.634
<v Speaker 4>human being could do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is give themselves a neck tattoo on </v>

3001
02:15:02.071 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 4>their body.</v>

3002
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:04.870
<v Speaker 4>If you just decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3003
02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about like a pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler mean for fighters.</v>

3004
02:15:10.201 --> 02:15:12.630
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty commonplace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the average person,</v>

3005
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:14.363
<v Speaker 4>my friends call me Lou dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody calls told me their friend at </v>

3006
02:15:17.731 --> 02:15:18.564
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't good at defending any of this </v>

3007
02:15:22.051 --> 02:15:24.810
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Already been a good.</v>

3008
02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.480
<v Speaker 4>Like everything is fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arms was a fat kid,</v>

3009
02:15:31.111 --> 02:15:31.944
<v Speaker 4>so I said Lou dog and really small </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I could only afford a $60 </v>

3010
02:15:33.811 --> 02:15:34.644
<v Speaker 4>tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little petite Lou dog and then below </v>

3011
02:15:36.391 --> 02:15:38.370
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even the full thing that could</v>

3012
02:15:38.371 --> 02:15:40.800
<v Speaker 4>connect around my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a little bit of tribal,</v>

3013
02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:44.010
<v Speaker 4>just like a slipper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a two inch sliver of tribal.</v>

3014
02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:45.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is a kid in high school?</v>

3015
02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:49.920
<v Speaker 6>Most of the guys that were doing tattoos</v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't good artists.</v>

3016
02:15:50.090 --> 02:15:50.923
<v Speaker 6>There was a few good artists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You would find them in magazines and </v>

3017
02:15:52.891 --> 02:15:55.980
<v Speaker 6>Shit and he'd have to travel to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Connecticut to get a tattoo done.</v>

3018
02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:57.900
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was weird.</v>

3019
02:15:57.930 --> 02:15:58.763
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like now the artists are going from art </v>

3020
02:16:02.341 --> 02:16:07.260
<v Speaker 6>school right into tattooing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting these amazing pieces.</v>

3021
02:16:07.261 --> 02:16:10.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen tattoos like today in my</v>

3022
02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:12.330
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw one the other day.</v>

3023
02:16:12.450 --> 02:16:16.680
<v Speaker 6>Some guy had Michael Jordan tattooed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looked like a leg or an arm.</v>

3024
02:16:16.681 --> 02:16:19.920
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't tell what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like they took a photograph and</v>

3025
02:16:19.921 --> 02:16:21.310

<v Speaker 3>but you came up with this shit.</v>

3145
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:44.180
<v Speaker 3>This is the Third Reich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God with us.</v>

02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It says it's Third Reich Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

3147
02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Alexander on the Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God with us as a phrase commonly used in</v>

3148
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Harold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harold.</v>

3149
02:21:58.630 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Harold in Prussia from 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3150
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:02.420
<v Speaker 3>one and later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3151
02:22:02.610 --> 02:22:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Per pressure first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does it has its roots in Prussia?</v>

3152
02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3153
02:22:06.501 --> 02:22:09.670
<v Speaker 3>The German military during period </v>
<v Speaker 3>spanning the German empire.</v>

3154
02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen 71 to 1918.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was World War One and then the</v>

3155
02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Third Reich 1933 to 45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was in the first two bikes on.</v>

3156
02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:20.510
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just the third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most important thing is that the</v>

3157
02:22:20.511 --> 02:22:22.580
<v Speaker 3>origins are pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3158
02:22:22.581 --> 02:22:24.560
<v Speaker 3>And so he's very nationalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3159
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still couldn't be you to be luck,</v>

3160
02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:27.841
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3161
02:22:27.841 --> 02:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>today's Day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3162
02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:34.090
<v Speaker 3>we all know the swastika.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has other meetings before the Germans</v>

3163
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:36.120
<v Speaker 3>took over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't get a swastika tattoo.</v>

3164
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good one I'm talking about is</v>

3165
02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>the cry of the Swedish army.</v>

3166
02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:43.650
<v Speaker 3>See it's in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>31.</v>

3167
02:22:43.651 --> 02:22:44.484
<v Speaker 3>It was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was saying got men on Owens by </v>

3168
02:22:47.581 --> 02:22:48.414
<v Speaker 3>sabotage during the battle of Britain </v>
<v Speaker 3>field and 1631 God with us with the war </v>

3169
02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:54.900
<v Speaker 3>cry of the Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Swedish army.</v>

3170
02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:57.540
<v Speaker 3>It was the last time Sweden was picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>wars with anybody.</v>

3171
02:22:57.541 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 3>So this is probably like some Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>gang shit is what we were missing.</v>

3172
02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:01.584
<v Speaker 3>Like God is with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning God is with the Russian gang </v>

3173
02:23:03.901 --> 02:23:04.734
<v Speaker 3>members and we're just jumping into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusions because the Nazis liked it </v>

3174
02:23:06.871 --> 02:23:07.710
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3175
02:23:07.711 --> 02:23:08.544
<v Speaker 3>And we're also like in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Nazis are such a symbol of evil </v>

3176
02:23:11.341 --> 02:23:12.174
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly in his culture in </v>

3177
02:23:13.951 --> 02:23:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Russia where they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's like fucking,</v>

3178
02:23:16.441 --> 02:23:17.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler is this,</v>

3179
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:18.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3180
02:23:18.051 --> 02:23:20.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antichrist that we can make them out</v>

3181
02:23:20.131 --> 02:23:22.770
<v Speaker 3>to beat the Nazis didn't get along very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3182
02:23:22.771 --> 02:23:24.150
<v Speaker 3>They also had their own guy.</v>

3183
02:23:24.210 --> 02:23:25.043
<v Speaker 3>They had stolen just starving people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was responsible for one more deaths </v>

3184
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:31.110
<v Speaker 3>and he was responsible for their deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dabs on people.</v>

3185
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:31.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3186
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:32.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler killed a lot of Russians to </v>

3187
02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:38.460
<v Speaker 3>everybody killed Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians get fucked up,</v>

3188
02:23:38.461 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're so hardy.</v>

3189
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:42.030
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're so dangerous as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

3190
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:43.043
<v Speaker 3>Those are the survivors man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you got some cream of the crop </v>

3191
02:23:45.241 --> 02:23:49.650
<v Speaker 3>genetics over in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit in fucking in like a hundred</v>

3192
02:23:49.650 --> 02:23:50.300
<v Speaker 3>year period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

3193
02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:50.911
<v Speaker 3>not because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3194
02:23:50.911 --> 02:23:53.190
<v Speaker 3>like America was in two world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't here.</v>

3195
02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like we went and we send our boys</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go fight over there.</v>

3196
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:56.453
<v Speaker 3>Russia had two world wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're country straight up collapsed </v>

3197
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.823
<v Speaker 3>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had the Bolshevik revolution and </v>

3198
02:24:03.661 --> 02:24:04.494
<v Speaker 3>then the collapse of the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they had like just genocidal </v>

3199
02:24:08.761 --> 02:24:10.720
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship inbetween that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3200
02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:12.740
<v Speaker 3>There was just a bad time to be rushing.</v>

3201
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:13.833
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've gone through a whole bunch of </v>

3202
02:24:14.581 --> 02:24:17.040
<v Speaker 3>those in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go look at Russian history,</v>

3203
02:24:17.041 --> 02:24:17.874
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the gang is con exhibit at </v>

3204
02:24:22.471 --> 02:24:23.304
<v Speaker 3>the Reagan Library out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get to see how much of Russia </v>

3205
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:27.503
<v Speaker 3>they captured and how much of like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know that gang is Khan had the </v>

3206
02:24:31.681 --> 02:24:36.681
<v Speaker 3>biggest empire ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they literally owned all of Eurasia</v>

3207
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 3>and he was fucking like 40 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people and I mean that dude,</v>

3208
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:43.763
<v Speaker 3>there's some insane number of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are genetically related to him in </v>

3209
02:24:46.531 --> 02:24:47.364
<v Speaker 3>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like insane number at that he would </v>

3210
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:51.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do this shit where they would</v>

3211
02:24:51.031 --> 02:24:51.864
<v Speaker 3>like send like a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a while since I read about </v>

3212
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:55.410
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like they would like send it,</v>

3213
02:24:55.411 --> 02:24:57.060
<v Speaker 3>like when they were going to conquer </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a village,</v>

3214
02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:59.760
<v Speaker 3>they'd like sending a note is basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>

3215
02:24:59.761 --> 02:25:01.980
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just give up all your shit right now and</v>

3216
02:25:01.981 --> 02:25:02.814
<v Speaker 3>you'll be okay.</v>

3217
02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:04.020
<v Speaker 3>And then some of the villages would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3218
02:25:04.021 --> 02:25:05.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not giving up all their shapes.</v>

3219
02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:07.290
<v Speaker 3>And then they just come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:25:07.291 --> 02:25:09.390
<v Speaker 3>And then they do that just to like send </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking message.</v>

3221
02:25:09.391 --> 02:25:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Like even people who agreed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were brutal.</v>

3222
02:25:12.331 --> 02:25:13.164
<v Speaker 3>Brutal Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you listened to Dan Carlin's wrath </v>

3223
02:25:14.721 --> 02:25:17.740
<v Speaker 3>of the cons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about it.</v>

3224
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:20.010
<v Speaker 3>If you're a regular listener to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

3225
02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I apologize for the next couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

3226
02:25:22.170 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 3>the greatest fucking podcast series </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

3227
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:26.980
<v Speaker 3>It's all about Gaviscon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

3228
02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:27.963
<v Speaker 3>I knew he's a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like my knowledge of gang is </v>

3229
02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:33.220
<v Speaker 3>con was similar to my current knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Alexander the Great.</v>

3230
02:25:33.470 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was gay.</v>

3231
02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>He killed a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know.</v>

3232
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:39.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3233
02:25:39.471 --> 02:25:40.304
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in modern Afghanistan that that </v>

3234
02:25:41.471 --> 02:25:42.304
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about Alexander </v>

3235
02:25:43.511 --> 02:25:47.290
<v Speaker 3>the Great and that was the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with gangs con and he was a bad guy.</v>

3236
02:25:47.290 --> 02:25:50.470
<v Speaker 3>Conquered a lot of people you know who </v>
<v Speaker 3>owned the world for awhile,</v>

3237
02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:55.720
<v Speaker 3>but Dan Carlin's five part series is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn good that you just get.</v>

3238
02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:56.593
<v Speaker 3>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just really get a really accurate </v>

3239
02:25:58.391 --> 02:26:03.280
<v Speaker 3>sense of how insane life was back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what these fucking people did.</v>

3240
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:04.503
<v Speaker 3>This one story about the corps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Shaw who sent an envoy to Gin </v>

3241
02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:09.753
<v Speaker 3>China and along the way they saw in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance what they thought was a snow </v>

3242
02:26:12.701 --> 02:26:15.260
<v Speaker 3>covered mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as they got closer they realize that</v>

3243
02:26:15.261 --> 02:26:19.630
<v Speaker 3>it was a pile of bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed everyone in the city.</v>

3244
02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:24.400
<v Speaker 3>They killed a million people and stack </v>
<v Speaker 3>them up and these people were.</v>

3245
02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:29.230
<v Speaker 3>They had abandoned the road because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road was so overrun with bodies that had</v>

3246
02:26:29.231 --> 02:26:30.064
<v Speaker 3>rotten decade that people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick and dying because there were so </v>

3247
02:26:34.001 --> 02:26:39.001
<v Speaker 3>many bodies had abandoned the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's with anything anyone cares about.</v>

3248
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this goes for myself too,</v>

3249
02:26:40.931 --> 02:26:43.240
<v Speaker 3>like anyone who's into like issues or </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

3250
02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:45.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like you should always just keep in</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind we have.</v>

3251
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:46.660
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

3252
02:26:46.661 --> 02:26:50.320
<v Speaker 3>We have it so good compared to what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's happy,</v>

3253
02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:52.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's what progress is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want it so good.</v>

3254
02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:53.740
<v Speaker 3>We want it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want better,</v>

3255
02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:56.500
<v Speaker 3>we want better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to know no this no that,</v>

3256
02:26:56.501 --> 02:26:58.120
<v Speaker 3>no violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sexism,</v>

3257
02:26:58.121 --> 02:26:59.200
<v Speaker 3>no racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

3258
02:26:59.330 --> 02:27:00.790
<v Speaker 3>You want a better and better and better </v>
<v Speaker 3>and better,</v>

3259
02:27:00.791 --> 02:27:02.620
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now we got some ground.</v>

3260
02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.620
<v Speaker 3>People are getting more and more excited</v>
<v Speaker 3>about gaining more new ground yet,</v>

3261
02:27:05.621 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's like we're never going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>it be perfect.</v>

3262
02:27:07.301 --> 02:27:09.010
<v Speaker 3>So I almost was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why though?</v>

3263
02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:10.233
<v Speaker 3>Because that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The concept of never being any sort of </v>

3264
02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism,</v>

3265
02:27:13.841 --> 02:27:14.674
<v Speaker 3>racism or sexism or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's always going to perceive </v>

3266
02:27:19.211 --> 02:27:20.290
<v Speaker 3>something as being that.</v>

3267
02:27:20.290 --> 02:27:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's gonna.</v>

3268
02:27:21.210 --> 02:27:22.043
<v Speaker 3>It's the onus is almost on the quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>unquote victims sometimes to take the </v>

3269
02:27:25.061 --> 02:27:26.020
<v Speaker 3>step back and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3270
02:27:26.021 --> 02:27:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a victim right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a brown person.</v>

3271
02:27:28.331 --> 02:27:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I want to call it racism,</v>

3272
02:27:29.651 --> 02:27:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I can do it every single day of my life </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I really want to.</v>

3273
02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:32.713
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like we're never going to </v>

3274
02:27:33.601 --> 02:27:35.980
<v Speaker 3>have that because it's very addictive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a victim.</v>

3275
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It's very addictive to feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were wronged in some way.</v>

3276
02:27:38.591 --> 02:27:39.424
<v Speaker 3>And it's also very addicted to look for </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons for it that aren't really </v>

3277
02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.430
<v Speaker 3>necessarily your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3278
02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.070
<v Speaker 3>doesn't necessarily revenues of a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm helping the world that idea.</v>

3279
02:27:48.071 --> 02:27:49.590
<v Speaker 3>And people feel like they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something good.</v>

3280
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:52.180
<v Speaker 3>You'll never convince them that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter how ridiculous they might be,</v>

3281
02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you'll never convince them with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3282
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:56.800
<v Speaker 3>My biggest beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I agree with you,</v>

3283
02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you too though.</v>

3284
02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how progress happens.</v>

3285
02:27:59.411 --> 02:28:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to keep wanting to make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and better.</v>

3286
02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:06.400
<v Speaker 3>My biggest problem with say like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the like left wing activists of today is</v>

3287
02:28:06.401 --> 02:28:07.234
<v Speaker 3>that it's like they'll just go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like they want to burn it </v>

3288
02:28:09.311 --> 02:28:10.144
<v Speaker 3>down because it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just appreciate how the steps that </v>

3289
02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:17.320
<v Speaker 3>we've come and let's go the next step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't burn it down because it can be</v>

3290
02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:20.230
<v Speaker 3>a lot worse with way we hold on to ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and beliefs.</v>

3291
02:28:20.231 --> 02:28:22.670
<v Speaker 3>It takes several generations for real </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress to occur.</v>

3292
02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:27.470
<v Speaker 3>The problem right now is there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>technological progress that's aiding the</v>

3293
02:28:27.471 --> 02:28:28.304
<v Speaker 3>physical progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The progress is taking place far faster </v>

3294
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:30.884
<v Speaker 3>than they can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like going down hill in the </v>

3295
02:28:32.901 --> 02:28:34.730
<v Speaker 3>snow and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus.</v>

3296
02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you're in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drive,</v>

3297
02:28:36.111 --> 02:28:36.944
<v Speaker 3>a downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the smells like you kinda can hit </v>

3298
02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:39.410
<v Speaker 3>the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are they really going to work?</v>

3299
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:42.500
<v Speaker 3>You're ahead of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have full control.</v>

3300
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:43.423
<v Speaker 3>And I think as a human species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the currently the state we're at </v>

3301
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:47.660
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people were trying to force things</v>

3302
02:28:47.661 --> 02:28:48.494
<v Speaker 3>down people and we're trying to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>change and change normally takes a long </v>

3303
02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:55.460
<v Speaker 3>ass time to really settle in and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening so quick,</v>

3304
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:57.030
<v Speaker 3>we can't really keep up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3305
02:28:57.100 --> 02:28:59.240
<v Speaker 3>that's the old rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3306
02:28:59.241 --> 02:29:00.074
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have the same way to </v>

3307
02:29:00.471 --> 02:29:01.304
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get an idea across the world </v>

3308
02:29:02.631 --> 02:29:04.680
<v Speaker 3>instantly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3309
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:05.533
<v Speaker 3>so I think that people are reacting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and they don't know how to really </v>

3310
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:08.170
<v Speaker 3>deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3311
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:09.043
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to know how to share an </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea with somebody that might not agree </v>

3312
02:29:11.301 --> 02:29:12.134
<v Speaker 3>the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do because you turn up yourself </v>

3313
02:29:13.001 --> 02:29:14.820
<v Speaker 3>when you go to the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever's,</v>

3314
02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:16.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing next to online,</v>

3315
02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:18.770
<v Speaker 3>we get along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're cool no matter what.</v>

3316
02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Our backgrounds are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we believe.</v>

3317
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:21.710
<v Speaker 3>We're just coexisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3318
02:29:21.711 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 3>well that's like the shit I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>before about chick flavors,</v>

3319
02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:24.653
<v Speaker 3>other businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well just I'm sure there's some guy who </v>

3320
02:29:25.821 --> 02:29:27.620
<v Speaker 3>just believes shit that I find </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrifying,</v>

3321
02:29:27.621 --> 02:29:28.281
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3322
02:29:28.281 --> 02:29:29.490
<v Speaker 3>let me get a water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me get a dog.</v>

3323
02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:31.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't even think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit,</v>

3324
02:29:31.251 --> 02:29:31.671
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3325
02:29:31.671 --> 02:29:33.650
<v Speaker 3>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do exist in this world.</v>

3326
02:29:33.651 --> 02:29:35.960
<v Speaker 3>We like come together and do all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit all the time,</v>

3327
02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:36.973
<v Speaker 3>but then you can kind of like pretend </v>
<v Speaker 3>online that you have this like we're </v>

3328
02:29:40.821 --> 02:29:41.654
<v Speaker 3>worlds apart and I would never do </v>
<v Speaker 3>business with this problem is </v>

3329
02:29:44.511 --> 02:29:47.210
<v Speaker 3>communicating online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shitty way of communicating.</v>

3330
02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:51.290
<v Speaker 3>People shouldn't have conversations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of each other where they look each</v>

3331
02:29:51.291 --> 02:29:55.580
<v Speaker 3>other and you can work through stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast for real,</v>

3332
02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:58.820
<v Speaker 3>your harvest and write about it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have an opportunity to be wrong.</v>

3333
02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Find out why you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>

3334
02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:03.220
<v Speaker 3>process it as opposed to editing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion down and going.</v>

3335
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very specific,</v>

3336
02:30:05.091 --> 02:30:08.600
<v Speaker 3>perfect version where it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>really what your opinion is.</v>

3337
02:30:08.601 --> 02:30:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just how people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive it.</v>

3338
02:30:10.371 --> 02:30:12.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a game you play in a word game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3339
02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:13.123
<v Speaker 3>the word games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing board sports in trying to when </v>

3340
02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:15.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a real problem with people </v>

3341
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:18.194
<v Speaker 3>that aren't good at communicating one on</v>
<v Speaker 3>one because that's really the most </v>

3342
02:30:21.591 --> 02:30:24.170
<v Speaker 3>valuable form of communication used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in front of each other.</v>

3343
02:30:24.171 --> 02:30:25.004
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to write you an email </v>

3344
02:30:25.731 --> 02:30:26.990
<v Speaker 3>because I can't really talk to you about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3345
02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:27.913
<v Speaker 3>And then you get this crazy email </v>
<v Speaker 3>accusing you of all sorts of shit and </v>

3346
02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:31.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're reading the tone.</v>

3347
02:30:31.221 --> 02:30:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could call him up.</v>

3348
02:30:32.631 --> 02:30:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Hey Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this email?</v>

3349
02:30:34.020 --> 02:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Like this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this shit didn't happen.</v>

3350
02:30:35.991 --> 02:30:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Then you get together and have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about it.</v>

3351
02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Like let's talk person to person big </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay.</v>

3352
02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:41.773
<v Speaker 3>We just got into the thing one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was and we just as </v>

3353
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:45.260
<v Speaker 3>we've been like fucking brothers for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3354
02:30:45.261 --> 02:30:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decade and a half almost,</v>

3355
02:30:47.001 --> 02:30:48.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like real close friends.</v>

3356
02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:49.593
<v Speaker 3>We've got to a thing where I just wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>him a long email so I'm going to write </v>

3357
02:30:51.441 --> 02:30:54.530
<v Speaker 3>it in form of an email and then he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the tone like very wrong,</v>

3358
02:30:54.531 --> 02:30:55.364
<v Speaker 3>so then he writes me back and email kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of shitty and now we're like in a </v>

3359
02:30:57.621 --> 02:30:58.454
<v Speaker 3>fucking fight and the reality was it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to communicate like road </v>

3360
02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:02.210
<v Speaker 3>dates or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so stupid.</v>

3361
02:31:02.211 --> 02:31:03.044
<v Speaker 3>You're like one conversation away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the whole thing and just like </v>

3362
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.640
<v Speaker 3>text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emails,</v>

3363
02:31:07.641 --> 02:31:08.474
<v Speaker 3>so much is left to interpretation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>depending upon how you're receiving </v>

3364
02:31:11.301 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a good mood,</v>

3365
02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's just busy.</v>

3366
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:15.110
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a good guy.</v>

3367
02:31:15.111 --> 02:31:17.260
<v Speaker 3>He'll get back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Downplay.</v>

3368
02:31:17.290 --> 02:31:18.770
<v Speaker 3>So like this motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always on,</v>

3369
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:24.230
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always on your terms to man call you and</v>

3370
02:31:27.091 --> 02:31:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't talk to me.</v>

3371
02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear this bitch ass shit</v>

3372
02:31:32.761 --> 02:31:36.750
<v Speaker 3>like people where people get angry if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're busy like oh my God,</v>

3373
02:31:36.810 --> 02:31:39.330
<v Speaker 3>it's always on your terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't know I'm busy.</v>

3374
02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:41.610
<v Speaker 3>And while you're saying it's on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms,</v>

3375
02:31:41.611 --> 02:31:43.980
<v Speaker 3>so much of that has to do with like your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking lie,</v>

3376
02:31:44.010 --> 02:31:44.843
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in a fight with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>chick and you don't have the job you </v>

3377
02:31:46.561 --> 02:31:48.760
<v Speaker 3>want to have and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then some guy doesn't return your.</v>

3378

3380
02:31:51.241 --> 02:31:53.280
<v Speaker 3>But if everything's going good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see what I was like,</v>

3381

<v Speaker 3>It's just not a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

3397
02:32:24.250 --> 02:32:25.051
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's all.</v>

3400
02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.000
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for it.</v>

3401
02:32:30.001 --> 02:32:30.834
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for express.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's good for fun to say shitty </v>

3402
02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:33.330
<v Speaker 3>things to each other.</v>

3403
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:36.780
<v Speaker 3>If you know for a fact that you real </v>
<v Speaker 3>good friends and yes,</v>

3404
02:32:36.781 --> 02:32:38.760
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3405
02:32:38.761 --> 02:32:39.990
<v Speaker 3>is good for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3406
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.670
<v Speaker 3>it's good for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3407
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:44.880
<v Speaker 3>if you want to check out something cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to www.cool</v>

3408
02:32:44.881 --> 02:32:46.580
<v Speaker 3>stuff.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not good for like,</v>

3409
02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:51.360
<v Speaker 3>let me explain to you my take on </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxation or worse,</v>

3410
02:32:51.361 --> 02:32:54.570
<v Speaker 3>your take on a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about your take on a person,</v>

3411
02:32:54.571 --> 02:32:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to have.</v>

3412
02:32:55.441 --> 02:32:58.420
<v Speaker 3>You're obviously you like to say some </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician or what have you.</v>

3413
02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.540
<v Speaker 3>You are absolutely related to have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion on them,</v>

3414
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:05.990
<v Speaker 3>but you're not really talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you really do know them,</v>

3415
02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:07.173
<v Speaker 3>we just sit like there's always a </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitation if looking at someone from </v>

3416
02:33:09.901 --> 02:33:10.734
<v Speaker 3>afar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3417
02:33:11.130 --> 02:33:15.090
<v Speaker 3>And if you could sit down in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

3418
02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.070
<v Speaker 3>some politician that you agree with or </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with,</v>

3419
02:33:17.071 --> 02:33:17.904
<v Speaker 3>and then have a conversation with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you would find out who the fuck </v>

3420
02:33:21.181 --> 02:33:21.870
<v Speaker 3>they really are.</v>

3421
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:22.703
<v Speaker 3>Then you'd find out who the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are in respect to this argument </v>

3422
02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:26.490
<v Speaker 3>and that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't do that.</v>

3423
02:33:26.690 --> 02:33:28.320
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

3424
02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:29.363
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that everybody who has an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea about anybody else can be with </v>

3425
02:33:32.161 --> 02:33:35.910
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have to respect that gap.</v>

3426
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Like if you like sports guys are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst at it,</v>

3427
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.863
<v Speaker 3>the worst when they talk about a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>player being lazy or certain fighter </v>

3428
02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:44.990
<v Speaker 3>being a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what in?</v>

3429
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:50.270
<v Speaker 3>What are you going on about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a professional cage</v>

3430
02:33:50.611 --> 02:33:54.540
<v Speaker 3>fighter and you're calling him a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've read that shit all day.</v>

3431
02:33:54.670 --> 02:33:55.503
<v Speaker 3>Read it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's that thing where you would </v>

3432
02:33:57.721 --> 02:33:59.730
<v Speaker 3>never say that if you were in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3433
02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you would never say that in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3434
02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I weirdly think that like as a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sorta,</v>

3435
02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you're buying the right to express that </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

3436
02:34:06.931 --> 02:34:09.060
<v Speaker 3>In a weird way though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that they're a pussy,</v>

3437
02:34:09.390 --> 02:34:10.223
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when people get mad at people </v>

3438
02:34:11.941 --> 02:34:13.710
<v Speaker 3>booing at UFC events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going like,</v>

3439
02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of buying that experience,</v>

3440
02:34:16.051 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can't hate on them if</v>

3441
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.560
<v Speaker 5>they want to express themselves that </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3442
02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:22.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3443
02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:23.710
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of sort of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3444
02:34:23.711 --> 02:34:23.951
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3445
02:34:23.951 --> 02:34:27.970
<v Speaker 5>I got very humbled doing the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Michael bisping because I was doing</v>

3446
02:34:27.971 --> 02:34:30.550
<v Speaker 5>radio on Sirius Xm for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about mma,</v>

3447
02:34:30.551 --> 02:34:33.110
<v Speaker 5>like I fucking knew anything and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>starting to show bisque bake.</v>

3448
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:33.731
<v Speaker 5>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3449
02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:34.511
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

3450
02:34:34.511 --> 02:34:36.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even going to pretend like I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know shit.</v>

3451
02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.990
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so much better at it now.</v>

3452
02:34:37.991 --> 02:34:40.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to fit into this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>like mold or,</v>

3453
02:34:40.991 --> 02:34:42.970
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3454
02:34:42.971 --> 02:34:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I think that from a fan's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really get mad at them when they</v>

3455
02:34:46.841 --> 02:34:49.300
<v Speaker 5>start talking shit or start to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like,</v>

3456
02:34:49.410 --> 02:34:50.680
<v Speaker 5>it's part of the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3457
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:52.271
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3458
02:34:52.271 --> 02:34:54.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you shouldn't,</v>

3459
02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:58.000
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be disrespectful to people for</v>
<v Speaker 5>no reason like that.</v>

3460
02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:58.863
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of guys that get into it </v>

3461
02:34:59.681 --> 02:35:02.950
<v Speaker 5>just because it's like they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're behind a wall and they could lob</v>

3462
02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:04.720
<v Speaker 5>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a pussy move.</v>

3463
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:05.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3464
02:35:05.981 --> 02:35:06.814
<v Speaker 5>it's not healthy for me going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like if you go to an event and </v>

3465
02:35:09.881 --> 02:35:10.714
<v Speaker 5>there's two guys getting in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking fighting to start booing them </v>

3466
02:35:14.201 --> 02:35:15.370
<v Speaker 5>just seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3467
02:35:15.430 --> 02:35:16.390
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3468
02:35:16.391 --> 02:35:17.224
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking to entertain you guys </v>

3469
02:35:19.301 --> 02:35:21.820
<v Speaker 5>getting in there and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and putting it all on the line.</v>

3470
02:35:21.821 --> 02:35:22.654
<v Speaker 5>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a right to know I would never </v>

3471
02:35:25.061 --> 02:35:25.894
<v Speaker 5>in a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time I kind of </v>

3472
02:35:26.861 --> 02:35:28.180
<v Speaker 5>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like,</v>

3473
02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:30.250
<v Speaker 5>well they should be able to build your </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy shows to then.</v>

3474
02:35:30.610 --> 02:35:31.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you,</v>

3475
02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:33.460
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you why not?</v>

3476
02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:37.000
<v Speaker 5>Because they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that at a comedy show,</v>

3477
02:35:37.001 --> 02:35:37.834
<v Speaker 5>if they're booing you during your set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're completely taking out the </v>

3478
02:35:40.301 --> 02:35:43.300
<v Speaker 5>experience for everybody else and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it'll a live sporting event.</v>

3479
02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:44.710
<v Speaker 5>It's just not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

3480
02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.000
<v Speaker 5>they're not getting into the fighters </v>
<v Speaker 5>had.</v>

3481
02:35:46.001 --> 02:35:47.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they are a little bit,</v>

3482
02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:49.480
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked to Mike about this.</v>

3483
02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:51.220
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people booed me.</v>

3484
02:35:51.221 --> 02:35:52.054
<v Speaker 5>They fucking love my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a different type of person that is </v>

3485
02:35:54.290 --> 02:35:55.123
<v Speaker 5>wearing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a different kind of mental </v>

3486
02:35:56.561 --> 02:35:57.810
<v Speaker 5>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can you.</v>

3487
02:35:57.850 --> 02:36:00.940
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can plow through everything and that's</v>

3488
02:36:00.941 --> 02:36:02.470
<v Speaker 5>why I became a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3489
02:36:02.471 --> 02:36:06.130
<v Speaker 5>he's like one of the most mentally </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong guys to ever fight in mma because</v>

3490
02:36:06.131 --> 02:36:08.380
<v Speaker 5>he's a god that when he started out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was good.</v>

3491
02:36:08.381 --> 02:36:09.214
<v Speaker 5>He was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He won the ultimate fighter season two </v>

3492
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:12.503
<v Speaker 5>and was a good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but willed himself in the position of </v>

3493
02:36:15.971 --> 02:36:19.180
<v Speaker 5>being a champion and was knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was stopped,</v>

3494
02:36:19.181 --> 02:36:21.670
<v Speaker 5>was beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had his momentum stopped,</v>

3495
02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:26.700
<v Speaker 5>restart it right back up again with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same or better enthusiasm every time and</v>

3496
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:28.000
<v Speaker 5>deep into his thirties.</v>

3497
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.100
<v Speaker 5>Did it all clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No steroids,</v>

3498
02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:32.110
<v Speaker 5>no allegations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no bullshit.</v>

3499
02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:36.190
<v Speaker 5>Just worked hard and was tough as fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>and won the fucking middleweight title.</v>

3500
02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:37.840
<v Speaker 5>It's a different type of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

3501
02:36:37.841 --> 02:36:38.591
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3502
02:36:38.591 --> 02:36:39.424
<v Speaker 5>He lost two in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that he went out there and </v>

3503
02:36:41.921 --> 02:36:42.754
<v Speaker 5>had a fight that I thought he was going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to win until GSP called him with that </v>

3504
02:36:45.761 --> 02:36:46.700
<v Speaker 5>left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was gonna,</v>

3505
02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:47.553
<v Speaker 5>win the fight and then loses the GSP for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the title and the biggest middleweight </v>

3506
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:53.560
<v Speaker 5>fight probably ever and then just goes,</v>

02:36:58.650 --> 02:37:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's such a fucking straight up ass dude</v>

3510
02:37:02.231 --> 02:37:03.310
<v Speaker 5>logic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3511
02:37:03.311 --> 02:37:04.144
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3512
02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:06.610
<v Speaker 5>I already did a training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not get two paychecks?</v>

3513
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:10.090
<v Speaker 5>It was a rough fight though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was a smart,</v>

3514
02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:12.330
<v Speaker 5>smarter than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you on that.</v>

3515
02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:15.040
<v Speaker 5>Still up that George George,</v>
<v Speaker 5>St Pierre,</v>

3516
02:37:15.420 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he took</v>

3517
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.190
<v Speaker 6>four years off and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's still one of the greatest,</v>

3518
02:37:19.191 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 6>if not the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you saw that in that fight?</v>

3519
02:37:22.251 --> 02:37:23.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he was.</v>

3520
02:37:23.450 --> 02:37:26.750
<v Speaker 6>I mean Michael cut them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He caught him with those elbows,</v>

3521
02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:30.050
<v Speaker 6>particularly from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know George St Pierre is,</v>

3522
02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:32.900
<v Speaker 6>he's a special guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He really is a special athlete.</v>

3523
02:37:32.901 --> 02:37:35.750
<v Speaker 6>People were really underestimating how </v>
<v Speaker 6>great George St Pierre was.</v>

3524
02:37:35.751 --> 02:37:38.420
<v Speaker 6>He's the guy who beat every person that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was ever put in front of them.</v>

3525
02:37:38.421 --> 02:37:41.050
<v Speaker 6>The losses that he had avenged.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So butte,</v>

3526
02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:45.330
<v Speaker 6>dominantly George Saint Pierre is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>monster and you know,</v>

3527
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:47.360
<v Speaker 6>I think that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>including myself,</v>

3528
02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:48.223
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really didn't think he was going to be </v>

3529
02:37:48.951 --> 02:37:49.784
<v Speaker 6>able to come back with that long of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>layoff and compete the way that you set </v>

3530
02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:54.163
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike was just mentally push himself for </v>

3531
02:37:55.311 --> 02:37:56.144
<v Speaker 6>getting better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael bisping today destroys Michael </v>

3532
02:37:58.970 --> 02:38:01.070
<v Speaker 6>Bisping a younger Michael bisping seven </v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

3533
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:02.690
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's an old man now.</v>

3534
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:05.030
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3535
02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:09.350
<v Speaker 6>the fighting is such a crazy proposition</v>
<v Speaker 6>that even with like elite guys,</v>

3536
02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:13.130
<v Speaker 6>like even when someone won a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you make them fight again,</v>

3537
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:15.440
<v Speaker 6>would they win 100 percent of the time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't think they would.</v>

3538
02:38:15.470 --> 02:38:16.440
<v Speaker 6>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3539
02:38:16.450 --> 02:38:19.910
<v Speaker 6>So there's things in weird events that </v>
<v Speaker 6>can change your fortunate a fight.</v>

3540
02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:21.460
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Steve,</v>

3541
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:22.343
<v Speaker 6>I think if in Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Ghana could beat him a few times if </v>

3542
02:38:24.111 --> 02:38:27.140
<v Speaker 6>they fought 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he could not come out 10 times steep.</v>

3543
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:27.983
<v Speaker 6>A definitely doesn't win all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ten is definitely a few that haven't </v>

3544
02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:33.740
<v Speaker 6>gone for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they have a rematch,</v>

3545
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:34.993
<v Speaker 6>see the thing about like what would you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to restart it with a time machine </v>

3546
02:38:38.391 --> 02:38:39.224
<v Speaker 6>where there's no memory whatsoever by </v>
<v Speaker 6>experiencing each other because you </v>

3547
02:38:42.401 --> 02:38:43.040
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get,</v>

3548
02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:44.390
<v Speaker 6>you understand patterns.</v>

3549
02:38:44.390 --> 02:38:46.910
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's weird when you see guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight training partners.</v>

3550
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:51.410
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's guys that just know </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other so well that when they get in</v>

3551
02:38:51.411 --> 02:38:53.360
<v Speaker 6>there they've already got established a </v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern.</v>

3552
02:38:53.361 --> 02:38:54.194
<v Speaker 6>One guy's always bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other guy in training one guys beat </v>

3553
02:38:56.061 --> 02:38:57.980
<v Speaker 6>the other guy up and you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they actually fight.</v>

3554
02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well actually,</v>

3555
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:01.970
<v Speaker 6>and the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just as we're saying this,</v>

3556
02:39:01.971 --> 02:39:02.600
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3557
02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.540
<v Speaker 6>George St Pierre was the greatest ever I</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to make a case for.</v>

3558
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:06.463
<v Speaker 6>If you have to make a case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's a stronger case </v>

3559
02:39:08.061 --> 02:39:08.894
<v Speaker 6>for anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then for George sounds crazy coming </v>

3560
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:10.901
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3561
02:39:10.901 --> 02:39:12.350
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he beat everyone.</v>

3562
02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:13.193
<v Speaker 6>Whoever he ever faced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had two losses that were Matt Hughes </v>

3563
02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:21.760
<v Speaker 6>and Matt Serra Right and came back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>destroyed them in the rematches Matt,</v>

3564
02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:22.933
<v Speaker 6>Matt Hughes twice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Matt Serra just came back and beat </v>

3565
02:39:24.971 --> 02:39:26.600
<v Speaker 6>him in the third rubber match.</v>

3566
02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:29.660
<v Speaker 6>Never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then after retiring,</v>

3567
02:39:29.810 --> 02:39:32.480
<v Speaker 6>comes back and wins the championship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A division up,</v>

3568
02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:33.373
<v Speaker 6>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Michael Bisping and chokes him </v>

3569
02:39:36.141 --> 02:39:39.590
<v Speaker 6>unconscious with a rear naked choke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was one of the tightest,</v>

3570
02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.340
<v Speaker 6>most cinched up rear naked choke I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever seen anybody perform ever.</v>

3571
02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:45.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had it like a Jujitsu guy,</v>

3572
02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:46.873
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of MMA guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have a harder time getting those </v>

3573
02:39:48.651 --> 02:39:49.484
<v Speaker 6>gloves fully locked into position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a difference between </v>

3574
02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:53.533
<v Speaker 6>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an a rear naked choke with the </v>

3575
02:39:55.881 --> 02:39:56.714
<v Speaker 6>palm is touching the back of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which a lot of people opt for because </v>

3576
02:39:58.881 --> 02:40:00.530
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to make as much space for</v>
<v Speaker 6>the arm.</v>

3577
02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:02.660
<v Speaker 6>You can get back there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can grab that head,</v>

3578
02:40:02.661 --> 02:40:03.494
<v Speaker 6>but the real way to do it as like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real way to do it as a karate chop </v>

3579
02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:07.454
<v Speaker 6>where you go to the back of the neck </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the karate chop and once you have </v>

3580
02:40:10.101 --> 02:40:10.934
<v Speaker 6>that in place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then there's this crazy leverage and it </v>

3581
02:40:13.741 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 6>just</v>

3582
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.813
<v Speaker 3>squeezes the fuck out of someone's neck </v>
<v Speaker 3>on someone really gets one of those </v>

3583
02:40:18.181 --> 02:40:19.014
<v Speaker 3>locked in and that's what George did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way he did it was like as tight </v>

3584
02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 3>and sweet and four star black belt </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

3585
02:40:26.941 --> 02:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>rear naked choke the you ever seen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

3586
02:40:30.991 --> 02:40:33.320
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to listen to you describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful.</v>

3587
02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:35.413
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never gave a shit at all the same way </v>

3588
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:39.743
<v Speaker 3>like me and Michael [inaudible] at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point to become friends to where it's </v>

3589
02:40:41.851 --> 02:40:44.340
<v Speaker 3>like you start to fucking care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>

3590
02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:47.670
<v Speaker 3>If you imagine being a family member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you imagine having somebody that you,</v>

3591
02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:48.870
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood is in there.</v>

3592
02:40:49.290 --> 02:40:50.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3593
02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:53.790
<v Speaker 3>being a fan of somebody is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know somebody and that,</v>

3594
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:55.440
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was hard to watch.</v>

3595
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:56.303
<v Speaker 3>Shops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends and I had to do </v>

3596
02:40:57.061 --> 02:40:59.970
<v Speaker 3>commentary on some of his fights because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a real hard time.</v>

3597
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:00.903
<v Speaker 3>It real hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last couple of fights in particular was </v>

3598
02:41:02.431 --> 02:41:03.264
<v Speaker 3>very hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very hard to to like I have to be as </v>

3599
02:41:06.871 --> 02:41:07.704
<v Speaker 3>equally enthusiastic about him getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit as I am about him hitting somebody </v>

3600
02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:11.633
<v Speaker 3>and I know the guy very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show us their shirt mass shooting for </v>

3601
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:15.174
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even said like everybody knew that I </v>

3602
02:41:16.231 --> 02:41:18.210
<v Speaker 3>was really good friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

3603
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:19.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had done a bunch of podcasts </v>

3604
02:41:19.561 --> 02:41:20.394
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was also the guy who talked him </v>

3605
02:41:21.411 --> 02:41:22.890
<v Speaker 3>into retiring because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3606
02:41:22.891 --> 02:41:24.700
<v Speaker 3>I know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

3607
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:25.553
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this with other people and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not friends with them and it's not my </v>

3608
02:41:27.541 --> 02:41:30.180
<v Speaker 3>position to tell people to stop and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know them that well.</v>

3609
02:41:30.181 --> 02:41:32.400
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to know someone real well to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where their head's at,</v>

3610
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:33.623
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a sport where proof see like </v>

3611
02:41:37.261 --> 02:41:39.570
<v Speaker 3>if you're billing a basketball game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

3612
02:41:39.570 --> 02:41:40.403
<v Speaker 3>I guess I guess like there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so much more intense about a </v>

3613
02:41:44.311 --> 02:41:46.920
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like there's smart blues,</v>

3614
02:41:46.921 --> 02:41:47.754
<v Speaker 3>like when someone does something illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>or someone does something or someone </v>

3615
02:41:53.791 --> 02:41:56.280
<v Speaker 3>does something that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's smart boost,</v>

3616
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.293
<v Speaker 3>but then there's booze where guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>facing each other and they're canceling </v>

3617
02:41:59.911 --> 02:42:03.990
<v Speaker 3>each other out like you're watching a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really high level thing,</v>

3618
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:06.330
<v Speaker 3>what these guys are trying to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do,</v>

3619
02:42:06.350 --> 02:42:07.183
<v Speaker 3>what do I have to do to connect on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's fucking brainstem and knock his </v>

3620
02:42:10.501 --> 02:42:11.334
<v Speaker 3>lights out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the UFC is marketing toward these </v>

3621
02:42:13.501 --> 02:42:14.334
<v Speaker 3>casual fans who are basketball fans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>football fans who aren't really the </v>

3622
02:42:16.651 --> 02:42:19.860
<v Speaker 3>people who are hardcore who appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the martial arts side of it.</v>

3623
02:42:19.861 --> 02:42:21.900
<v Speaker 3>What these guys are putting into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

3624
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.943
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're marketing towards </v>

3625
02:42:24.721 --> 02:42:26.730
<v Speaker 3>any specific fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not marketing towards.</v>

3626
02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:27.563
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's the almost the same </v>

3627
02:42:29.971 --> 02:42:30.804
<v Speaker 3>thing because they're just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mass audience and the majority of </v>

3628
02:42:32.641 --> 02:42:34.430
<v Speaker 3>people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who really understand.</v>

3629
02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:36.910
<v Speaker 3>What makes you say that though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you say they're trying?</v>

3630
02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they doing specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3631
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I feel like when they put together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3632
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.863
<v Speaker 3>fights that don't necessarily make sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of rankings when they put the </v>

3633
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:46.343
<v Speaker 3>interim belts on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flights were don't really need to be </v>

3634
02:42:48.031 --> 02:42:49.290
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just know it's a marketing move.</v>

3635
02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Because I think a title on a poster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll probably sell that many tickets.</v>

3636
02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely juices it up.</v>

3637
02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:57.540
<v Speaker 3>When you have an interim title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a marketing dude.</v>

3638
02:42:57.541 --> 02:42:58.171
<v Speaker 3>It's going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3639
02:42:58.171 --> 02:42:59.004
<v Speaker 3>we saw this many more paper version </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the title and you know the </v>

3640
02:43:01.531 --> 02:43:03.360
<v Speaker 3>difference between the interim title or </v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular title.</v>

3641
02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:04.193
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the casuals don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between Michael Bisbing or </v>

3642
02:43:06.211 --> 02:43:07.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking doors Api.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3643
02:43:07.401 --> 02:43:08.234
<v Speaker 3>I'm with your set of bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel conflicted because I have </v>

3644
02:43:10.651 --> 02:43:12.640
<v Speaker 3>this part me that's like a purist that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3645
02:43:12.641 --> 02:43:13.474
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be just like whoever number </v>

3646
02:43:14.171 --> 02:43:18.190
<v Speaker 3>one is versus the champion and we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>never fuck around that same time.</v>

3647
02:43:18.250 --> 02:43:19.210
<v Speaker 3>If they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3648
02:43:19.211 --> 02:43:20.044
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just set up Nick Diaz versus conor </v>

3649
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

3650
02:43:22.001 --> 02:43:24.700
<v Speaker 3>that's the greatest thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened and I don't care.</v>

3651
02:43:24.850 --> 02:43:25.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if Khabib's one slash 72 </v>

3652
02:43:28.481 --> 02:43:29.314
<v Speaker 3>fights in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camp Bucca I'm flying a 100 out of 100 </v>

3653
02:43:34.181 --> 02:43:35.014
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck where he's fighting </v>

3654
02:43:35.501 --> 02:43:37.420
<v Speaker 3>who he's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just fun and it's exciting,</v>

3655
02:43:37.421 --> 02:43:38.254
<v Speaker 3>but let's get real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was something really pure </v>

3656
02:43:40.391 --> 02:43:41.224
<v Speaker 3>and what's beautiful about mma is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always going to kind of figure </v>

3657
02:43:44.081 --> 02:43:44.650
<v Speaker 3>itself out.</v>

3658
02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:46.300
<v Speaker 3>It is the greatest sport because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest sport.</v>

3659
02:43:46.301 --> 02:43:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Anything can happen any given Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's inherently built.</v>

3660
02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:51.100
<v Speaker 3>The marketing is sort of built in </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

3661
02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:52.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can,</v>

3662
02:43:52.210 --> 02:43:53.043
<v Speaker 3>you can create a pecking order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can create rankings and I think you </v>

3663
02:43:55.061 --> 02:43:56.170
<v Speaker 3>can kind of just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3664
02:43:56.171 --> 02:43:57.004
<v Speaker 3>the pieces are gonna fall where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fall and it's always going to </v>

3665
02:43:58.441 --> 02:44:02.620
<v Speaker 3>be super exciting and you see what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way they handle connor or certain guys,</v>

3666
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:03.783
<v Speaker 3>they definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they threw that to the side and I think </v>

3667
02:44:05.891 --> 02:44:07.450
<v Speaker 3>conor is a great example of it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3668
02:44:07.451 --> 02:44:08.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3669
02:44:08.521 --> 02:44:09.011
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

3670
02:44:09.011 --> 02:44:09.844
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Do may whether they had it for a </v>

3671
02:44:11.621 --> 02:44:13.360
<v Speaker 3>little while because they were part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the promotion.</v>

3672
02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of millions of dollars off that</v>

3673
02:44:16.031 --> 02:44:18.550
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody made a fuck load of money.</v>

3674
02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:21.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether made hundreds of millions.</v>

3675
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Connor made $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

3676
02:44:22.691 --> 02:44:23.524
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the UFC made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody got fucking crazy paid and </v>

3677
02:44:27.011 --> 02:44:27.844
<v Speaker 3>then they started zoo for boxing and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are other offering a Joshua and </v>

3678
02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Joshua.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're offering 100 million.</v>

3679
02:44:33.901 --> 02:44:36.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm crazy contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently that might people.</v>

3680
02:44:36.041 --> 02:44:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3681
02:44:36.891 --> 02:44:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I haven't asked anybody if that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not surprised.</v>

3682
02:44:39.850 --> 02:44:41.740
<v Speaker 3>They realize there's a lot of money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting fights,</v>

3683
02:44:41.741 --> 02:44:45.700
<v Speaker 3>whether it's promoting mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana has a big background in boxing.</v>

3684
02:44:45.810 --> 02:44:47.350
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son actually just had a,</v>

3685
02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:49.900
<v Speaker 3>an amateur boxing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that and it's instagram.</v>

3686
02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana loves boxing,</v>

3687
02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:56.140
<v Speaker 3>so I always loved it so it's not unusual</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they decided to go into it,</v>

3688
02:44:56.530 --> 02:44:59.470
<v Speaker 3>but with connor was like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things where you're like,</v>

3689
02:44:59.471 --> 02:45:00.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

3690
02:45:00.891 --> 02:45:01.724
<v Speaker 3>If may with a really wants to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>conor and college never had a </v>

3691
02:45:03.461 --> 02:45:04.200
<v Speaker 3>professional fighting.</v>

3692
02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:06.280
<v Speaker 3>You make 100 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see,</v>

3693
02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:07.990
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see who buys it,</v>

3694
02:45:07.991 --> 02:45:11.440
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying that the MMA purists</v>
<v Speaker 3>were what's best for the sport of MMA.</v>

3695
02:45:11.441 --> 02:45:13.560
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily the best move and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3696
02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:14.403
<v Speaker 3>it's not bad move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt it at all because first </v>

3697
02:45:16.331 --> 02:45:17.164
<v Speaker 3>of all it shows you that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>specialties that there are people that </v>

3698
02:45:20.801 --> 02:45:21.634
<v Speaker 3>have skills and techniques and abilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>that far exceed the very best mma </v>

3699
02:45:25.001 --> 02:45:27.100
<v Speaker 3>fighters and you saw that with conor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>floyd.</v>

3700
02:45:27.101 --> 02:45:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Floyd just fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucked him up.</v>

3701
02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:30.513
<v Speaker 3>But Connor caught them a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he tagged him in the beginning and you </v>

3702
02:45:33.311 --> 02:45:36.910
<v Speaker 3>can say that floyd wasn't going full </v>
<v Speaker 3>tilt and he probably wasn't.</v>

3703
02:45:36.930 --> 02:45:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I would say definitely wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was definitely trying to wear him out</v>

3704
02:45:39.971 --> 02:45:40.804
<v Speaker 3>and get him tired because he knew that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he relied on kinetic energy for the </v>

3705
02:45:42.701 --> 02:45:44.950
<v Speaker 3>first round or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still got clipped with a shot.</v>

3706
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:46.420
<v Speaker 3>He did want to get clipped with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3707
02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:47.593
<v Speaker 3>I think floyd wanted to see what connor </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing and he spent the first few </v>

3708
02:45:50.711 --> 02:45:51.544
<v Speaker 3>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of taking in data and like </v>

3709
02:45:53.050 --> 02:45:53.651
<v Speaker 3>seeing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3710
02:45:53.651 --> 02:45:55.600
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What Weird Shit are you trying?</v>

3711
02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:56.613
<v Speaker 3>But still I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not think connor was going to do </v>

3712
02:45:59.381 --> 02:46:00.214
<v Speaker 3>that good teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would be over within three </v>

3713
02:46:02.291 --> 02:46:03.124
<v Speaker 3>or four rounds and made whether it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock him out and he would just </v>

3714
02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:08.500
<v Speaker 3>outclassed him in the fact that it went </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 and then even landed some shots.</v>

3715
02:46:08.501 --> 02:46:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight itself.</v>

3716
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:11.263
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not bad for as a purist I'm saying </v>

3717
02:46:12.681 --> 02:46:17.681
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like it's the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of letting connor run the show.</v>

3718
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I just Kinda feel like the UFC sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>always built this brand UFC,</v>

3719
02:46:23.751 --> 02:46:24.131
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3720
02:46:24.131 --> 02:46:29.131
<v Speaker 5>it's a coca cola of MMA and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>connor has basically become bigger or at</v>

3721
02:46:30.381 --> 02:46:33.400
<v Speaker 5>the very least as big as the UFC and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do,</v>

3722
02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.210
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't give a shit tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tweeted out the other day,</v>

3723
02:46:35.211 --> 02:46:37.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm the boss when he was promoting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>video game,</v>

3724
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:40.160
<v Speaker 5>like they did a diploma with Dana White </v>
<v Speaker 5>is one of the characters,</v>

3725
02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:42.073
<v Speaker 5>but I just feel like that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily the best thing for mixed </v>

3726
02:46:45.561 --> 02:46:47.960
<v Speaker 5>martial arts as a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I almost feel like what they were doing,</v>

3727
02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.370
<v Speaker 5>which doesn't hurt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3728
02:46:49.371 --> 02:46:50.204
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not.</v>

3729
02:46:50.330 --> 02:46:52.070
<v Speaker 5>I think it made it bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like,</v>

3730
02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:52.993
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what connor created was like a thing </v>

3731
02:46:54.771 --> 02:46:57.500
<v Speaker 5>that's like really hard to.</v>

3732
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:58.363
<v Speaker 5>Even when he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he fought a marcus bridge as his </v>

3733
02:47:00.351 --> 02:47:01.184
<v Speaker 5>first fight in the UFC and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 5>already there was like an energy in the </v>

3734
02:47:04.041 --> 02:47:08.600
<v Speaker 5>crowd about connor fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She to know who this guy was angry,</v>

3735
02:47:08.601 --> 02:47:09.434
<v Speaker 5>like why is this such a big thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that every fight was just a bigger </v>

3736
02:47:12.141 --> 02:47:14.990
<v Speaker 5>and bigger and bigger thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we create this thing where like</v>

3737
02:47:15.170 --> 02:47:16.003
<v Speaker 5>Dustin [inaudible] biggest fight ever is</v>
<v Speaker 5>against conor mcgregor and Dustin had </v>

3738
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:20.203
<v Speaker 5>way more big fights than him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still the big deal was that you're </v>

3739
02:47:22.731 --> 02:47:23.930
<v Speaker 5>fighting this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he just,</v>

3740
02:47:24.050 --> 02:47:27.080
<v Speaker 5>he would create these stages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just that it was the results.</v>

3741
02:47:27.081 --> 02:47:27.914
<v Speaker 5>Like you put moccasins for him and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts dust employee in the first round </v>

3742
02:47:31.351 --> 02:47:35.750
<v Speaker 5>he slept Josie Aldo in 13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Swayze was all real accomplishments.</v>

3743
02:47:36.250 --> 02:47:38.450
<v Speaker 5>Why him fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

3744
02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:41.720
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting because he was so </v>
<v Speaker 5>exceptional as a striker.</v>

3745
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:43.080
<v Speaker 5>But do you think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3746
02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:43.770
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3747
02:47:43.770 --> 02:47:47.720
<v Speaker 5>I give the UFC so much credit with </v>
<v Speaker 5>building conor conor mcgregor because he</v>

3748
02:47:47.721 --> 02:47:49.220
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't have been able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>anywhere else.</v>

3749
02:47:49.221 --> 02:47:50.054
<v Speaker 5>Like the UFC is such a big brand that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't have been a war fighter and </v>

3750
02:47:53.271 --> 02:47:54.550
<v Speaker 5>become a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3751
02:47:54.551 --> 02:47:55.384
<v Speaker 5>a worldwide name the way he is now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably not in bits which is weird to </v>

3752
02:47:58.911 --> 02:48:01.960
<v Speaker 5>bell towards a stupid name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to accept facts.</v>

3753
02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:08.990
<v Speaker 5>Thought about that until you just said </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3754
02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:09.824
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't let him make an sucks balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The regency box say it's time for </v>

3755
02:48:14.841 --> 02:48:18.380
<v Speaker 5>regency boxing on HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this nonsense?</v>

3756
02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Why would you call a regency boxing mma?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just call it mma.</v>

3757
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:25.130
<v Speaker 5>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

3758
02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Just like when you watch Hbo Boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's on Hbo and it's boxing.</v>

3759
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:29.743
<v Speaker 5>Think good that the UFC is sort of built</v>
<v Speaker 5>this brand around it because I think </v>

3760
02:48:32.171 --> 02:48:34.730
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the sport in itself,</v>

3761
02:48:34.731 --> 02:48:36.140
<v Speaker 5>because in boxing even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3762
02:48:36.170 --> 02:48:39.700
<v Speaker 5>you don't really know the difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>between any of the title or the,</v>

3763
02:48:39.701 --> 02:48:41.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the organizations or the titles.</v>

3764
02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:41.750
<v Speaker 5>You don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3765
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:42.890
<v Speaker 5>The WBC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the W.</v>

3766
02:48:42.891 --> 02:48:43.724
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even fans don't really know the </v>

3767
02:48:46.251 --> 02:48:47.190
<v Speaker 5>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3768
02:48:47.210 --> 02:48:49.250
<v Speaker 5>they know who the big guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know Anthony.</v>

3769
02:48:49.251 --> 02:48:51.260
<v Speaker 5>Joshua,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know as Klitschko forever.</v>

3770
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:52.343
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows about deontay wilder </v>

3771
02:48:53.271 --> 02:48:54.480
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a few guy,</v>

3772
02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:56.140
<v Speaker 5>but there's a couple of other champions </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are out there.</v>

3773
02:48:56.141 --> 02:48:56.510
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

3774
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:57.720
<v Speaker 5>who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's this guy?</v>

3775
02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:03.050
<v Speaker 5>The guy you've never heard of has like </v>
<v Speaker 5>six belts on his championship chapters,</v>

3776
02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:05.330
<v Speaker 5>intercontinental championships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets belts.</v>

3777
02:49:05.331 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like ugly boxing titles that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking</v>

3778
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.903
<v Speaker 3>big old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The UFC nailed it with that belt belt </v>

3779
02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:15.690
<v Speaker 3>champion belt connor had two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes with my other fucking belt.</v>

3780
02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I want to be the champ champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got his arms look,</v>

3781
02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:20.573
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3782
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:22.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no sport like it.</v>

3783
02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:23.813
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is going to hurt it as long as </v>

3784
02:49:25.171 --> 02:49:28.620
<v Speaker 3>it's as long as people are interested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as long as people enjoy it.</v>

3785
02:49:28.621 --> 02:49:29.454
<v Speaker 3>As much as I enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as I enjoy watching it so much </v>

3786
02:49:31.981 --> 02:49:34.210
<v Speaker 3>as I enjoyed calling it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as that's going to be the case,</v>

3787
02:49:34.230 --> 02:49:35.870
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be kids coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>up like this.</v>

3788
02:49:35.871 --> 02:49:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Sean o'malley kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wild motherfucker kid,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They love it so much and when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

3796
02:49:54.511 --> 02:49:55.344
<v Speaker 3>they love it so much and they're so good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to be better the next </v>

<v Speaker 3>getting better and better and better,</v>

3798
02:50:00.451 --> 02:50:03.390
<v Speaker 3>and that's what connor did as well as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up that window because everyone's</v>

3799
02:50:03.391 --> 02:50:05.730
<v Speaker 3>going to get paid a lot more money now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's so much.</v>

3800
02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.550
<v Speaker 3>You see people talking about hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars at stake.</v>

3801
02:50:08.850 --> 02:50:10.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3802
02:50:10.110 --> 02:50:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sugar.</v>

3803
02:50:11.251 --> 02:50:12.084
<v Speaker 3>Sean o'malley could be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>multimin multimillionaire and a couple </v>

3804
02:50:15.691 --> 02:50:16.524
<v Speaker 3>of years I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kid could be huge and that's just </v>

3805
02:50:19.890 --> 02:50:22.380
<v Speaker 3>the CBD oil company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man.</v>

3806
02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:24.780
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking wild man too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way fights.</v>

3807
02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Was He gaming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got one of them.</v>

3808
02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Gaming chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking hilarious,</v>

3809
02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:31.250
<v Speaker 3>but he's good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He.</v>

3810
02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:33.900
<v Speaker 3>The thing about him is he's like super </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative.</v>

3811
02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:34.853
<v Speaker 3>What does that thing down that low go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lefthand side and scroll down to </v>

3812
02:50:37.161 --> 02:50:39.030
<v Speaker 3>that video of him working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he doing there?</v>

3813
02:50:39.850 --> 02:50:41.610
<v Speaker 3>What is he doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of weird,</v>

3814
02:50:41.611 --> 02:50:44.480
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3815
02:50:44.490 --> 02:50:48.990
<v Speaker 3>like he's practicing and he does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>threesixty take down to the back control</v>

3816
02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:51.840
<v Speaker 3>like guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might not ever do that in real</v>

3817
02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:53.250
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he might hit that all the time.</v>

3818
02:50:53.251 --> 02:50:55.080
<v Speaker 3>So he does that high kick but leave the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spin.</v>

3819
02:50:55.230 --> 02:50:56.063
<v Speaker 3>So that spans for the guard pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very confused because a lot of </v>

3820
02:50:58.531 --> 02:51:01.920
<v Speaker 3>times guys dive straight in and guys who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are good,</v>

3821
02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:04.770
<v Speaker 3>especially the half guard wind up </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrapping them up real quick,</v>

3822
02:51:04.771 --> 02:51:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but he does a spin around it.</v>

3823
02:51:06.930 --> 02:51:09.630
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he gave me the way he hits </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3824
02:51:09.631 --> 02:51:11.490
<v Speaker 3>If he does that over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3825
02:51:11.491 --> 02:51:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I bet he can do that in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3826
02:51:13.291 --> 02:51:16.170
<v Speaker 3>that's a cool thing about now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we watch it with like Anthony Pettis</v>

3827
02:51:16.171 --> 02:51:18.170
<v Speaker 3>was at first like holy fuck moment with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3828
02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:19.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less wgc event ever.</v>

3829
02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:20.621
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3830
02:51:20.621 --> 02:51:22.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jumping kick or whatever,</v>

3831
02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:23.753
<v Speaker 3>but you get guys that are so athletic </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that and now there's so much money </v>

3832
02:51:25.891 --> 02:51:29.840
<v Speaker 3>in the sport guys that might've went </v>
<v Speaker 3>into like football or basketball.</v>

3833
02:51:29.860 --> 02:51:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Now we're looking at MMA as an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you kind of weren't getting that</v>

3834
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:35.400
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's super athletes.</v>

3835
02:51:35.401 --> 02:51:36.234
<v Speaker 3>Think about that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dangerous are these guys going to </v>

3836
02:51:37.491 --> 02:51:39.210
<v Speaker 3>get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering about that like are they</v>

3837
02:51:39.211 --> 02:51:40.044
<v Speaker 3>ever going to get too dangerous where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna have to alter the rules </v>

3838
02:51:41.821 --> 02:51:44.520
<v Speaker 3>because there's two athletic they can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it cause too much damage.</v>

3839
02:51:44.850 --> 02:51:45.683
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to be much different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the best of the best now like a </v>

3840
02:51:47.551 --> 02:51:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Francis and gone to or a steep meo chick</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

3841
02:51:50.401 --> 02:51:51.234
<v Speaker 3>the Tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at a guy like tyron woodley </v>

3842
02:51:53.730 --> 02:51:54.563
<v Speaker 3>that is about as explosive as a man who </v>
<v Speaker 3>can step on a scale of 170 pounds for a </v>

3843
02:51:58.591 --> 02:52:00.300
<v Speaker 3>brief amount of time can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3844
02:52:00.301 --> 02:52:02.730
<v Speaker 3>And as good as they get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the competition kind of gets better too.</v>

3845
02:52:02.731 --> 02:52:05.100
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyron Woodley people from UFC two,</v>

3846
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:06.460
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this should be illegal.</v>

3847
02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Versus Tyrone Woodley could fight 60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in a row.</v>

3848
02:52:13.810 --> 02:52:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Seen 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan is only one 70.</v>

3849
02:52:16.271 --> 02:52:17.104
<v Speaker 3>I mean he wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they had real world 70 fighters </v>

3850
02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:21.930
<v Speaker 3>voice was one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3851
02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:25.210

<v Speaker 3>He's really about two five ish,</v>

3852
02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:30.240
<v Speaker 3>but those have been having problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't be the UFC Frye.</v>

3853
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Once you got into don fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don Frye was a big fella.</v>

3854
02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:38.873
<v Speaker 3>He's very much just landed knockout shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>before don frye could also take a </v>

3855
02:52:42.521 --> 02:52:43.354
<v Speaker 3>tremendous punch fight with Don Frye and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking Yama where they just did in </v>

3856
02:52:45.881 --> 02:52:47.200
<v Speaker 3>front of each other and wailed on each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like a fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the craziest things </v>

3861
02:52:54.101 --> 02:52:58.310
<v Speaker 3>anybody ever saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't go down as a man.</v>

3862
02:52:58.350 --> 02:53:00.880
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got on the podcast.</v>

3863
02:53:00.881 --> 02:53:01.571
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

3864
02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:02.404
<v Speaker 3>I would love to though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a boss and he's a great </v>

3865
02:53:05.141 --> 02:53:05.974
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

3866
02:53:06.130 --> 02:53:06.963
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had them calling a few times the </v>

3867
02:53:08.041 --> 02:53:09.550
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

3868
02:53:09.580 --> 02:53:10.413
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he paid the price physically for </v>

3869
02:53:12.131 --> 02:53:13.190
<v Speaker 3>that career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3870
02:53:13.230 --> 02:53:14.063
<v Speaker 3>he said some serious health consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real neck injuries and his body </v>

3871
02:53:18.701 --> 02:53:19.534
<v Speaker 3>just got beat the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he had real neck and back problems </v>

3872
02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:27.310
<v Speaker 3>from all those punches and take downs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and net cranks and all that shit.</v>

3873
02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:28.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was there the early,</v>

3874
02:53:28.691 --> 02:53:29.524
<v Speaker 3>early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early days to now this is the one like </v>

3875
02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:34.390
<v Speaker 3>he gets hit with a knee and they get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>email and each other.</v>

3876
02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:37.290
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is why we got into mma.</v>

3877
02:53:37.730 --> 02:53:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

3878
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at these guys.</v>

3879
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem real.</v>

3880
02:53:43.450 --> 02:53:44.283
<v Speaker 3>It literally doesn't seem real that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>could just stand and wail on each other </v>

3881
02:53:47.441 --> 02:53:49.990
<v Speaker 3>and talking how his face is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>swollen mass.</v>

3882
02:53:49.991 --> 02:53:52.390
<v Speaker 3>After this don fries caught on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forehead.</v>

3883
02:53:52.390 --> 02:53:55.810
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Don fry,</v>

3884
02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:59.950
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the first guys to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a way to shut down.</v>

3885
02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:01.830
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the other day with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Miletich,</v>

3886
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:04.060
<v Speaker 3>shut down Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like this look,</v>

3887
02:54:04.210 --> 02:54:05.043
<v Speaker 3>look at his fucking mount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was a real good wrestler and he </v>

3888
02:54:07.151 --> 02:54:10.390
<v Speaker 3>had a very good top game and he also was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good boxer too,</v>

3889
02:54:10.930 --> 02:54:11.763
<v Speaker 3>and just a fucking stud just to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just tell the guy in the world </v>

3890
02:54:15.191 --> 02:54:15.581
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3891
02:54:15.581 --> 02:54:17.350
<v Speaker 3>he first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he first fought in the UFC,</v>

3892
02:54:17.351 --> 02:54:18.184
<v Speaker 3>I believe he was only 200 pounds and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought a guy who was like three </v>

3893
02:54:22.451 --> 02:54:24.490
<v Speaker 3>something and fucked him up in like six </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

3894
02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:25.773
<v Speaker 3>He fought some big overweight guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked him with a jab and dropped him </v>

3895
02:54:28.541 --> 02:54:30.820
<v Speaker 3>with a jab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is just beat them down real quick.</v>

3896
02:54:30.940 --> 02:54:31.773
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd beat everyone until he ran</v>
<v Speaker 3>into Mark Coleman in the UFC and then </v>

3897
02:54:34.571 --> 02:54:37.030
<v Speaker 3>that was just like just to client </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler who too big,</v>

3898
02:54:37.031 --> 02:54:37.864
<v Speaker 3>too strong.</v>

3899
02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Literally how many in Dave Smith became </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

3900
02:54:39.701 --> 02:54:44.650
<v Speaker 3>We were roommates and we sort of renting</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC like that's how we got into UFC.</v>

3901
02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:45.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best stuff.</v>

3902
02:54:45.341 --> 02:54:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Knock out videos together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking blunts,</v>

3903
02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Bruce back days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3904
02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:51.693
<v Speaker 3>It was weird is that we got into it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like right around the time that we were </v>

3905
02:54:54.521 --> 02:54:55.354
<v Speaker 3>getting into UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate fighter dropped so it was </v>

3906
02:54:57.791 --> 02:54:58.624
<v Speaker 3>almost like we got into it at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that the country got into it when </v>

3907
02:55:01.931 --> 02:55:02.764
<v Speaker 3>we got into it a few months earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden this thing no one </v>

3908
02:55:04.491 --> 02:55:06.920
<v Speaker 3>gave a shit about was just like blowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3909
02:55:07.270 --> 02:55:08.103
<v Speaker 3>I remember we got to do during season </v>
<v Speaker 3>one so much that season to the fire was </v>

3910
02:55:10.341 --> 02:55:10.911
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

3911
02:55:10.911 --> 02:55:13.550
<v Speaker 3>do it this season to ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking nuts.</v>

3912
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Fights on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

3913
02:55:15.470 --> 02:55:17.960
<v Speaker 3>And there wasn't a fight in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode of season two.</v>

3914
02:55:18.250 --> 02:55:20.240
<v Speaker 3>We were furious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we almost broke our tv,</v>

3915
02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:22.590
<v Speaker 3>we watch old episodes.</v>

3916
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:26.023
<v Speaker 3>That's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also like a perfect storm of </v>

3917
02:55:27.951 --> 02:55:28.784
<v Speaker 3>like people getting interested in it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then having that ultimate fighter </v>

3918
02:55:31.161 --> 02:55:33.290
<v Speaker 3>reality show back in the days where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3919
02:55:33.650 --> 02:55:35.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still watch reality shows back then,</v>

3920
02:55:35.751 --> 02:55:38.720
<v Speaker 3>now you can't even fucking holding a gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>to my head and get me to watch a reality</v>

3921
02:55:38.721 --> 02:55:40.880
<v Speaker 3>show unless they're trying to survive in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>

3922
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I got like five of those saved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those shows like life below zero.</v>

3923
02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:47.390
<v Speaker 3>That's my jam dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that show.</v>

3924
02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:51.830
<v Speaker 3>But out there finding salmon shit to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just chopping down trees,</v>

3925
02:55:51.831 --> 02:55:54.830
<v Speaker 3>try to stay alive that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could maybe get into,</v>

3926
02:55:54.980 --> 02:55:55.813
<v Speaker 3>but I will say I think there's something</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about the post reality show </v>

3927
02:55:57.921 --> 02:55:59.840
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we got over reality shows,</v>

3928
02:55:59.841 --> 02:56:00.674
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like we're never the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you never quite go back to like </v>

3929
02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:06.230
<v Speaker 3>even just like in like what you do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this show versus a radio show.</v>

3930
02:56:06.231 --> 02:56:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not starting to like Hello </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3931
02:56:08.490 --> 02:56:10.790
<v Speaker 3>a little shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hobo.</v>

3932
02:56:13.140 --> 02:56:14.450
<v Speaker 3>We don't want any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3933
02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:16.280
<v Speaker 3>We just want like an honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

3934
02:56:16.281 --> 02:56:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3935
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.943
<v Speaker 3>in entertainment in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want something that it just seems </v>

3936
02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:23.030
<v Speaker 3>it's not as showy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more just like what real life would</v>

3937
02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:23.873
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3938
02:56:24.330 --> 02:56:26.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what people want for sure.</v>

3939
02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about it is it's like it's</v>

3940
02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:31.490
<v Speaker 3>led to a guy who was a reality star was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>

3941
02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:35.020
<v Speaker 3>That's as weird as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

3942
02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.780
<v Speaker 3>that is a reality star president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a politician,</v>

3943
02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:38.633
<v Speaker 3>just a businessman got on a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a big time celebrity and now he won </v>

3944
02:56:43.311 --> 02:56:46.400
<v Speaker 3>a popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's the runner of the country,</v>

3945
02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.273
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that isn't an advertisement for </v>

3946
02:56:48.621 --> 02:56:51.230
<v Speaker 3>just fucking motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you want to say.</v>

3947
02:56:51.231 --> 02:56:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Like he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that,</v>

3948
02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:56.030
<v Speaker 3>or just an advertisement for how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking system sucks.</v>

3949
02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.750
<v Speaker 3>My favorite thing about Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3950
02:56:58.950 --> 02:56:59.783
<v Speaker 3>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have to really argue with </v>

3951
02:57:01.041 --> 02:57:03.170
<v Speaker 3>lefties about butthead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democracy is a flawed system,</v>

3952
02:57:03.171 --> 02:57:04.280
<v Speaker 3>but now you just look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3953
02:57:04.290 --> 02:57:05.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how about that?</v>

3954
02:57:05.370 --> 02:57:06.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was able to convince more fucking </v>

3955
02:57:07.530 --> 02:57:09.980
<v Speaker 3>than your person was Christina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's your leader.</v>

3956
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.903
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have four people and they're all </v>

3957
02:57:11.931 --> 02:57:13.400
<v Speaker 3>equally intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3958
02:57:13.540 --> 02:57:14.373
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get together and figure something </v>

3959
02:57:15.381 --> 02:57:16.214
<v Speaker 3>out rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get to a place where you </v>

3960
02:57:17.571 --> 02:57:20.360
<v Speaker 3>can't even communicate with those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore because it's $300 million of you</v>

3961
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:21.343
<v Speaker 3>and you're scattered across a continent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're all supposed to be on the </v>

3962
02:57:23.751 --> 02:57:26.480
<v Speaker 3>same team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>voting over like really important issues</v>

3963
02:57:26.481 --> 02:57:27.950
<v Speaker 3>that you probably don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about,</v>

3964
02:57:27.951 --> 02:57:30.920
<v Speaker 3>like what you're talking about earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>about assault weapons or fracking.</v>

3965
02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:34.130
<v Speaker 3>You'd be bringing up anything to certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>people offshore drilling.</v>

3966
02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:34.970
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing?</v>

3967
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:37.940
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is that we're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be for or against fracking.</v>

3968
02:57:37.941 --> 02:57:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely shouldn't be for it.</v>

3969
02:57:40.250 --> 02:57:41.083
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's proven that it's safe long </v>

3970
02:57:42.791 --> 02:57:45.950
<v Speaker 3>term because there's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're getting into water supplies that</v>

3971
02:57:45.951 --> 02:57:48.200
<v Speaker 3>causing earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of real,</v>

3972
02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:49.363
<v Speaker 3>real consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely a lot of problems </v>

3973
02:57:50.601 --> 02:57:51.434
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also definitely a lot of wealth </v>

3974
02:57:52.671 --> 02:57:55.180
<v Speaker 3>that was created on the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that energy.</v>

3975
02:57:55.220 --> 02:57:56.053
<v Speaker 3>Those are positive things and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is everybody wants to </v>

3976
02:57:59.441 --> 02:58:02.250
<v Speaker 3>discount the negative or the positive</v>

3977
02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:03.270
<v Speaker 5>note with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3978
02:58:03.270 --> 02:58:05.790
<v Speaker 5>No one agrees that it's actually a cost </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit ratio,</v>

3979
02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:06.743
<v Speaker 5>but the thing that's like what you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying before with like with four </v>

3980
02:58:08.461 --> 02:58:09.690
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>democracy works,</v>

3981
02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:11.580
<v Speaker 5>but I think a lot of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3982
02:58:11.581 --> 02:58:12.414
<v Speaker 5>so if we get into a fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like let's say we're in a car crash and </v>

3983
02:58:16.021 --> 02:58:18.390
<v Speaker 5>one of the people in the car or a car </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaks down rather,</v>

3984
02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:20.190
<v Speaker 5>and one of the people in the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mechanic,</v>

3985
02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:21.720
<v Speaker 5>we don't sit here and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3986
02:58:21.721 --> 02:58:23.520
<v Speaker 5>let's vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who gets to do this?</v>

3987
02:58:23.521 --> 02:58:24.151
<v Speaker 5>You just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3988
02:58:24.151 --> 02:58:24.984
<v Speaker 5>you're a mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The three of us are out in the fucking </v>

3989
02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:29.340
<v Speaker 5>woods hunting elk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me and Louis don't go like,</v>

3990
02:58:29.341 --> 02:58:30.820
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we should do it this way because</v>

3991
02:58:31.220 --> 02:58:32.990
<v Speaker 5>you've done this larger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have all day.</v>

3992
02:58:33.270 --> 02:58:37.360
<v Speaker 5>You're going to ruin the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

3993
02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:38.633
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just pure voting isn't how you get to </v>

3994
02:58:40.951 --> 02:58:41.200
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

3995
02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:44.670
<v Speaker 5>You defer to experts and when you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this voting thing where it's like,</v>

3996
02:58:44.671 --> 02:58:45.960
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll all just cast a vote.</v>

3997
02:58:45.961 --> 02:58:48.000
<v Speaker 5>The dumb people the same as the smart </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3998
02:58:48.090 --> 02:58:50.070
<v Speaker 5>the educated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same as the uneducated.</v>

3999
02:58:50.250 --> 02:58:53.790
<v Speaker 5>You end up with a fucking this </v>
<v Speaker 5>competition to just say bullshit.</v>

4000
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:55.200
<v Speaker 5>That gets anyone up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4004

<v Speaker 5>Should we end it or should we keep </v>

4007
02:59:08.880 --> 02:59:12.060
