<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.680

28
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>

29
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

30
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.270

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Or was it an old god?</v>

39
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.891

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:45.761

42
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>the only way to tell,</v>

47
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I let them know that I'm back.</v>

48
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

50
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.120

52
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>We get tested for marijuana.</v>

53
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>If you have any marijuana in your blood in Japan,</v>

54
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to fight it.</v>

55
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So what did you get arrested for?</v>

56
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.513
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana.</v>

57
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

58
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I had a 16 grams in my car.</v>

60
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I had a great 20 joints I had,</v>

61
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a little part in your pony and it was on the way down.</v>

62
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And they do a lot of inspections just randomly.</v>

63
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>They walk around in Japan,</v>

64
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of unconstitutional where they don't need a reason to search you.</v>

65
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>They'll come right up to your car and say,</v>

66
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.044
<v Speaker 1>I want a chicken your car.</v>

67
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I was stone and I had a,</v>

68
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I had a joint,</v>

69
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean a real short on the dashboard.</v>

70
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know when you're still in,</v>

71
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you think you're getting sneaky with you.</v>

72
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like so bad.</v>

73
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

74
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.543

78
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>they're following me the whole time.</v>

79
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you sit in their pocket.</v>

80
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:40.311
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

81
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>so I pull up,</v>

82
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.960

83
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.001

<v Speaker 1>like what is it like,</v>

90
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>is it like being caught with cocaine or heroin?</v>

91
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 1>Drugs?</v>

92
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.281
<v Speaker 1>A drug in Japan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I um,</v>

98
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I was facing some bad time,</v>

99
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:00.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

101
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I was a famous figure and they wanted to make an example to me,</v>

102
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:05.804
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>What was the worst case scenario?</v>

105
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it was five years.</v>

106
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

107

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>So I was facing that.</v>

109
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.044
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

110
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>it all depended on what came up in my house and my gym when he did the search</v>

111
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:19.814
<v Speaker 1>the next day.</v>

112
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.500

114
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

115
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.761
<v Speaker 1>Nothing came on.</v>

116
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>So that saved you?</v>

117
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:38.051
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:38.884

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:40.951
<v Speaker 3>I'm screwed.</v>

155
00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Because they will start the integration all over if I get caught in a lie.</v>

156
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not that popular.</v>

166
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that popular there.</v>

167
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:00.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

168
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.384

180
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but you're sitting there and you don't know what's going to happen to you and</v>

181
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on in the outside world cause you're shut off and</v>

182
00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering if you're going to spend five years.</v>

183
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a 20 days is a long,</v>

184
00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:31.484
<v Speaker 1>28 days.</v>

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.433
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you went from there and you said,</v>

187
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:34.761
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

188
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:35.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

189
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take on another fight.</v>

190
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>He went there and it was good for me actually.</v>

191
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I always think back and think,</v>

192
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:41.661
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

193
00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:42.411
<v Speaker 1>I should have done this.</v>

194
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:43.101
<v Speaker 1>I should've done this.</v>

195
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:43.811
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't put the roast,</v>

196
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Jeanette.</v>

197
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 1>And I keep thinking that and I catch myself and say,</v>

198
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:46.924
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

199
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.220
<v Speaker 1>this is a probably one of the best things that happened to you.</v>

200
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Cause the big,</v>

201
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing that happened to be in that was I,</v>

202
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I learned how important it,</v>

204
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:55.664
<v Speaker 1>my freedom was.</v>

205
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone takes it for granted every day.</v>

206
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.611
<v Speaker 1>Wake up,</v>

207
00:04:58.611 --> 00:04:58.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do today?</v>

209
00:04:59.511 --> 00:04:59.961
<v Speaker 1>And this like,</v>

210
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:00.350
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

211
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing to do.</v>

212
00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 1>His fricking overcast,</v>

213
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the shitty day.</v>

214
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.180
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do it so hard.</v>

215
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

216
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I miss this.</v>

217
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.831
<v Speaker 1>It's a Shitty Day,</v>

218
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.011
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

219
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

220
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you can choose to stay at home,</v>

221
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to eat McDonald's or you can choose to just hang out or you can</v>

222
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 1>choose to be bored,</v>

223
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

225
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 1>That's freedom's awesome.</v>

226
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>So it was something that really made me realize how far important freedom was.</v>

227
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people take it for granted.</v>

229
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you dealing with a situation like that,</v>

231
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>especially over something like we'd where it's so nonsensical and crazy,</v>

232
00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>they could take away your freedom for fucking years.</v>

233
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that is a,</v>

235
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:35.750
<v Speaker 1>a man I serve the time,</v>

236
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.221
<v Speaker 1>went to the court.</v>

238
00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:37.431
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

239
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I got three years probation where I couldn't leave Japan for three years.</v>

240
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.160
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even get to go to my grandma's funeral.</v>

241
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>And I figured,</v>

242
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

243
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta be good this three years and then we'll start up again.</v>

244
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing I know I get a letter from the,</v>

245
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:52.134
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

246
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 1>the immigration telling me that I,</v>

247
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I just lost my green card,</v>

248
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>cause of infringement and I got to leave Japan.</v>

249
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

250
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.781
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

251
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:00.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

252
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

253
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been here for 20 years.</v>

254
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 1>My whole life is here.</v>

255
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I bought a house there,</v>

256
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I got Jim's here,</v>

257
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I can leave Japan.</v>

258
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So I called them up and they had this like this real generic answer.</v>

259
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

260
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're contesting it,</v>

261
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you were going to start an investigation,</v>

262
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to come down to immigration center and blah,</v>

263
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:16.521
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

264
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

265
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Went down,</v>

266
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.641
<v Speaker 1>took it.</v>

267
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It was an eight month investigation.</v>

268
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was ridiculous.</v>

269
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

270
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I have to go down there numerous times and just like all day interrogations and</v>

271
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>it would start from the beginning,</v>

272
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>the name of your mom and dad.</v>

273
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.511
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>

274
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm they clipped the fuck.</v>

275
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Does that have to do in anything?</v>

276
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:31.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

277
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just going along with the Roy and it's like the next week I go in for</v>

278
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>another interrogation to start all over again to a whole new investigator.</v>

279
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

280
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:39.921
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on?</v>

281
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I just told the other guy,</v>

282
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>and they got to a point,</v>

284
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>it was so bad that I got so frustrated in her as much as I needed to be in</v>

285
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

286
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the guy said,</v>

287
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.193
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

288
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I love Japan.</v>

289
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I made this place my home and it fucking Japan doesn't want me.</v>

290
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking be here.</v>

291
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I told him straight up like that and was like,</v>

292
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:56.601
<v Speaker 1>I started them off.</v>

293
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Should I just screwed myself,</v>

294
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

295
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

296
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.701
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

297
00:06:58.701 --> 00:06:58.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.721
<v Speaker 1>that's so frustrating.</v>

299
00:06:59.721 --> 00:06:59.881
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

300
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:00.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

302
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I served my time man and I'm,</v>

304
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.981
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to do,</v>

305
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing good things for Japan,</v>

306
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:05.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and you guys got to try and kick me out if you guys don't want me,</v>

308
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:08.271
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

309
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking beer for them.</v>

310
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't want me here,</v>

311
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.053
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

312
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.991
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

313
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>they've interrogation went on and there was one guy that was a phantom way when</v>

314
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>he was interrogating me and then he,</v>

315
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:18.631
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

316
00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>he kind of did something illegal where he,</v>

317
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.771
<v Speaker 1>he told me that the,</v>

318
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>between these two red markers said,</v>

319
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.200
<v Speaker 1>look at those two triggers.</v>

320
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.461
<v Speaker 1>You sit.</v>

321
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And he flipped it open.</v>

322
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.731
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

323
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>this is our petitions coming in for you not to get kicked out of Japan.</v>

324
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the papers like this thick.</v>

325
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:31.971
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

326
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.361
<v Speaker 1>well shit,</v>

327
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:32.901
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

328
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

329
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

330
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you got like 4,000 in already and the petitioners,</v>

331
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>your parent isn't just names,</v>

332
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you got to live your name,</v>

333
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.751
<v Speaker 1>your phone number,</v>

334
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.190
<v Speaker 1>your address and everything and they'll see your ad.</v>

335
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bullshit where you can just get people to sign their names,</v>

336
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.503
<v Speaker 1>just write some.</v>

337
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So they're writing this 4,000 and every time we get an integration,</v>

338
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:49.731
<v Speaker 1>I see that,</v>

339
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

340
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>that between those two red markers is getting thicker and thicker,</v>

341
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and I come through fine at the end,</v>

342
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>it came out to be 9,008 months,</v>

343
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>9,000 people sent in that they don't want me to keep those Japan and immigration</v>

344
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>is dear to protect Japan from dangerous,</v>

345
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 1>so-called dangerous foreigners.</v>

346
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So when they're,</v>

347
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>there are people that they're supposed to be protecting,</v>

348
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>is sending in 9,000 letters saying they don't want this guy kicked out.</v>

349
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So that was the overwhelming thing that I could've been the boarded.</v>

350
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
