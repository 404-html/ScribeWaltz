1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.811
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>so I got an injected and that was um,</v>

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>first of all looked like it got like run over by a semi truck for like two days.</v>

6
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like all black and blue or the injection you serve was,</v>

7
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:16.464
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

10
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd be super nervous.</v>

11
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you got infected it,</v>

12
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it could have gotten infected</v>

13
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>that cancer.</v>

14
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I've had Marissa and I would not wish Murcia on your Dick.</v>

15
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get mercy a triathlon.</v>

16
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

17
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

18
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>This was at though at the wildflower triathlon,</v>

19
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:34.081
<v Speaker 1>like coming back,</v>

20
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>my flight got delayed and I was covering all these kids like an off road</v>

21
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>triathlon and I had all these scrapes and wounds and I think,</v>

22
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I think my labor was in Vegas,</v>

23
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where,</v>

24
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but I had to check into a hotel.</v>

25
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Flight got delayed and I slept in this hotel room that I swear like there must</v>

26
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>have been something on the bed because within a few days like it was all,</v>

27
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>it gets all nasty and cakey and then it was eating a whole,</v>

29
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website and they see,</v>

30
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you can see pull up the hole in the back of my leg.</v>

31
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.953
<v Speaker 1>It's nasty.</v>

32
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.941
<v Speaker 1>Scares the shit out of him.</v>

33
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Just just search for like Ben Greenfield staff and you'll see the pictures.</v>

34
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>But it was eating a whole in the back of my leg and my,</v>

35
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>my kids role now,</v>

36
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>once a week and I buy,</v>

37
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.041
<v Speaker 1>I get the,</v>

38
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>the defense soap from on it.</v>

39
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they come,</v>

40
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they come back in the door,</v>

41
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I have them go into the shower upstairs and defense and writes down.</v>

42
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that train in a place</v>

44
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have a a shower.</v>

45
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful.</v>

47
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>thieves essential oil.</v>

49
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like going to like a whole bunch of companies make this version of</v>

50
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>essential oil called thieves.</v>

51
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like clove and roads named after these thieves who apparently never got</v>

52
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:37.884
<v Speaker 1>clove.</v>

53
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Cinnamon Eucalyptus,</v>

54
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>which is really good for staff and Rosemay.</v>

55
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.301
<v Speaker 1>It's actually named it.</v>

56
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>There's like this story of like these four thieves that apparently traveled</v>

57
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>around the world and they would rob Holmes and,</v>

58
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

59
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and they never got sick.</v>

60
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that's basically the story.</v>

61
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this was,</v>

62
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>this was some board table at a,</v>

63
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>at a multilevel marketing essential oils company.</v>

64
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Somebody came up with this story or it could be true.</v>

65
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

66
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>But the um,</v>

67
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

68
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:03.781
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

69
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>the stem cells into the Dick that that was an interesting one,</v>

70
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but it did.</v>

71
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I think from what I can tell,</v>

73
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>looking in the mirror,</v>

74
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.073
<v Speaker 1>it got bigger.</v>

75
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure how much,</v>

76
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>so half inch,</v>

77
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.961
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

78
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe that much like enough to tell and my erections got bigger and my</v>

79
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>orgasms got a lot better for how long they are still like that.</v>

80
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>people don't take what they have right in front of them.</v>

82
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Seriously enough.</v>

83
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like the wasting time thing.</v>

84
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't do the arithmetic,</v>

85
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>when they also don't understand,</v>

87
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>they devalue what they have right in front of them.</v>

88
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Like another,</v>

89
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>another client I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at</v>

90
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

91
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And so we did the arithmetic.</v>

92
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.181
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>well I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes a night trying to get them to go to</v>

94
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>

95
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

96
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:47.461
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>

97
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>let's analyze that.</v>

98
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.691
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

99
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.524
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>

100
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>it means that both of you end the day upset.</v>

102
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not so good cause why would you want that?</v>

103
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>It means that you're spending 45 minutes fighting when you could spend 20</v>

104
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>minutes doing something</v>

105
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.701
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

106
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Like reading to them say means that you don't get to spend that time with your</v>

107
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.171
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

108
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>So she's not very happy with you.</v>

109
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Plus you're annoyed because you don't see her.</v>

110
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Plus do you blame it on the kid?</v>

111
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Because he's the proximal cause.</v>

112
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's pretty damn ugly.</v>

113
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

114
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>and then let's do the arithmetic.</v>

115
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like seven days a week,</v>

116
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes a day.</v>

117
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's call that five hours,</v>

118
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>20 hours a week,</v>

119
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>240 hours in a year.</v>

120
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>It's six.</v>

121
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>You're spending a month and a half of work weeks fighting with your four year</v>

122
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 2>old son.</v>

123
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to like them.</v>

124
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.101
<v Speaker 2>You don't like anyone.</v>

125
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 2>You spend a month and a half a year fighting with.</v>

126
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad idea.</v>

127
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 2>Fix it.</v>

128
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.423
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

129
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Get them to bed,</v>

130
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>make it peaceful.</v>

131
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>You do it like these things that repeat every single day.</v>

132
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a Motif in this book to your life isn't Marguerite is on a beach in</v>

133
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Jamaica that happens now in that those are exceptions.</v>

134
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>You're life is how your wife greets you at the door when you come home every day</v>

135
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>cause that's like 10 minutes a day.</v>

136
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Your life is how you treat each other over the breakfast table cause that's an</v>

137
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half or an hour every single day.</v>

138
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 2>You get those mundane things right?</v>

139
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Those things you do every day,</v>

140
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you've concentrated on them and you make them pristine.</v>

141
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got 80% of your life put together.</v>

142
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>These little things that are right in front of us.</v>

143
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 2>They're not little.</v>

144
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing.</v>

145
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>They are not little and they're hard to set.</v>

146
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:20.561
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

147
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.371
<v Speaker 2>And if you set them right,</v>

148
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it has a rippling effect and fast to way faster than people think.</v>

149
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.493
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

150
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>people were sending me messages,</v>

151
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>blood's on your hands and this.</v>

152
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:29.651
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm like,</v>

153
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>if you went out and had unprotected Buzzcocks after listening to the Joe Rogan</v>

154
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:34.834
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

155
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you deserve what's coming.</v>

156
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.541
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to me and you're like,</v>

159
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:39.904
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

160
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Peter Duesberg,</v>

161
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

162
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.923
<v Speaker 1>Send it in.</v>

163
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.611
<v Speaker 1>Rex spot is go.</v>

164
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm odd man.</v>

165
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't demonize conversations.</v>

166
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know enough about the subject,</v>

167
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>but I listened to that guy's take on it.</v>

168
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's fuel for thought.</v>

169
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's right.</v>

171
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

172
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

173
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a lot of people that I don't figure,</v>

174
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:00.431
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

175
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I've talked to some crazy fucking people on the show and I think you</v>

176
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>gotta be able to have conversations.</v>

177
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

178
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

179
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean we might agree on 60% of things,</v>

180
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:11.681
<v Speaker 1>maybe 50,</v>

181
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe get somewhere between 40 and 70.</v>

182
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

183
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

184
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.393
<v Speaker 1>It should be okay.</v>

185
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>But it should be totally fine.</v>

186
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.501
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing when we do,</v>

187
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>the change my mind segments,</v>

190
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>most time people,</v>

191
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty amicable and then you just get someone who comes up and wants to</v>

192
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>commit assault the trickling puffs.</v>

193
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

194
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I think a big skill,</v>

195
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of had to learn this because not Jared knows.</v>

196
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

197
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>when we first had guests,</v>

198
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:31.271
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>

199
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>if it was a guest we just agreed with,</v>

200
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.641
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

201
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

202
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I will not edit you.</v>

203
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It will not be taken out of context.</v>

204
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>But I would sit down for three hours with them because they would be like,</v>

205
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.171
<v Speaker 1>don't cut me off.</v>

206
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:41.561
<v Speaker 1>Don't come up.</v>

207
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And you realize it just repeating themselves.</v>

208
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>So finding the balance of saying there are a lot of people out there now who are</v>

209
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>open to hearing these points of you who are open to hearing these ideas.</v>

210
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Being able to identify them and then being able to identify the people who are</v>

211
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>so bought in,</v>

212
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>they won't even listen.</v>

213
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>You need to make an example of them for the people you can convince.</v>

214
00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

215
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And understanding the two different kinds of people,</v>

216
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:01.501
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

217
00:06:01.501 --> 00:06:01.901
<v Speaker 1>the trigger,</v>

218
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>the puffs versus uh,</v>

219
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:04.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

221
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>

222
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably never saw himself as even political at all until he came out and</v>

223
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>said something that would seem to be so benign and caused an uproar.</v>

224
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

225
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I think being able to identify those two,</v>

226
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much just about left and right.</v>

227
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Who can hear who won't and how to handle them.</v>

228
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.461
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

229
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And why,</v>

230
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>why can't you hear?</v>

231
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Can you not hear because it interferes with your ideology or can you not hear?</v>

232
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Because what they're saying is illogical.</v>

233
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Like which one is it?</v>

234
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

235
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>are you honestly listening to what they're saying?</v>

236
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And can you give factual refute?</v>

237
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Can you give some sort of a factual review of this?</v>

238
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.624
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just,</v>

239
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't jive with your view of the world you have.</v>

240
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>You have some rock solid view of the world that you're not,</v>

241
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you're not willing to look at any other perspectives.</v>

243
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 3>So I had that big of a decision because the colorful kids didn't get no pussy.</v>

244
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 3>They just wanted to post.</v>

245
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 3>They would talk about girls and they may be had a crush on the girl and the four</v>

246
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 3>30 class,</v>

247
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 3>but then the rest of the company,</v>

248
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.593
<v Speaker 3>any of the events,</v>

249
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.741
<v Speaker 3>my other buddies,</v>

250
00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:02.574
<v Speaker 3>one the buzzy.</v>

251
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 3>So eventually I cut the karate fucking geeks out and I started hanging out with</v>

252
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 3>a little druggies.</v>

253
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.190
<v Speaker 3>And you make your transition from those developmental ages.</v>

254
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I tried to hide my drug use.</v>

255
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:17.724
<v Speaker 3>I tried to hide,</v>

256
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.120
<v Speaker 3>especially with marijuana use for two or three years.</v>

257
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 3>It was just marijuana.</v>

258
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 3>While then,</v>

259
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:29.820
<v Speaker 3>once I became a freshman and got it and start basketball my freshman year,</v>

260
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I decided to let's venture out into this acid thing.</v>

261
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's venture until this masculine thing.</v>

262
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.990
<v Speaker 3>It was a different name.</v>

263
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:40.801
<v Speaker 3>It was masculine,</v>

264
00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:42.750
<v Speaker 3>but it really wasn't Mescalin Joe Rogan.</v>

265
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.440
<v Speaker 3>It was a little tag Elodie it would know it wasn't even pay on.</v>

266
00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:48.360
<v Speaker 3>It was a little thing I did the same,</v>

267
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.863
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>

268
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

269
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.733
<v Speaker 3>Mba,</v>

270
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.170
<v Speaker 3>but masculine is what they sell you in the south.</v>

271
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.720
<v Speaker 3>They supposedly put it in Tequila or something.</v>

272
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.881
<v Speaker 3>This was Sao,</v>

273
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

274
00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

275
00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that tube,</v>

276
00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:02.970
<v Speaker 3>a little fucking white kids made in a pill.</v>

277
00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:07.620
<v Speaker 3>It was rat poison with something else and something else and it was very tiny.</v>

278
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.960
<v Speaker 3>It was maybe a little size of this.</v>

279
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.891
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

280
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And it came in aluminum foil.</v>

281
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Even smaller than that.</v>

282
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

283
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Even smaller than that.</v>

284
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Way Smaller,</v>

285
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.890
<v Speaker 3>that little thing that that's it.</v>

286
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 3>You paid $80 for it and you got a hundred of those and you start looking at $3 a</v>

287
00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:30.621
<v Speaker 3>piece and that would fuck you up for six hours with a two hour Hayes in between</v>

288
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 3>an hour buffer.</v>

289
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to come down and I did that for three or four months.</v>

290
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Then they introduced me to THC crystal,</v>

291
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.180
<v Speaker 3>which is snorting.</v>

292
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.770
<v Speaker 3>They sold it as,</v>

293
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.790
<v Speaker 3>what we do is we got a bunch of stems and seeds from the reefer.</v>

294
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 3>We put it in a pot and we boil that pot and whatever separate from the stems and</v>

295
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 3>the that goes to the sides.</v>

296
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 3>We scraped that off.</v>

297
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you snot in your nose.</v>

298
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

299
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 3>So I was,</v>

300
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.153
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

301
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I had like a personal karate rule,</v>

302
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 3>but I would always just smoke it and do the masculine,</v>

303
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 3>but I was never going to put nothing in my nose.</v>

304
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh you had a rule like a drug addict puts something in their nose.</v>

305
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

306
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.781
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

307
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a complete different range.</v>

308
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll never shoot heroin and I'll never put,</v>

309
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 3>especially at my karate man as a carotid man.</v>

310
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

311
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Carotid morals.</v>

312
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

313
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I was just straight away with the reefer and then I finally ended up snoring</v>

314
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 3>that fucking gorilla biscuits shit.</v>

315
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's what it was.</v>

316
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 3>It was angel dust.</v>

317
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 3>They just like God told you.</v>

318
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 3>And I went on an angel dust tab.</v>

319
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Like every Sunday me and my friend Carlos Perez would buy a six pack of</v>

320
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:44.424
