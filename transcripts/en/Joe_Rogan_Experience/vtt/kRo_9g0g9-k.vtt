<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

24
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.330

<v Speaker 1>smoggy and it took me longer to get out </v>

<v Speaker 1>go do a workout.</v>

27
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I was still in the San Diego </v>
<v Speaker 1>international parking lot so I can't </v>

28
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>wait to go back.</v>

33
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we moved to a town that has 22,000</v>

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>260,000</v>

36
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 1>people and I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my only regret is that it took us so </v>

37
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>long to pull the trigger on doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is unbelievable.</v>

38
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And have you done the winter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:45.471
<v Speaker 1>Once I visited the winter last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were there for the whole month of </v>

42
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a few days it was negative 10.</v>

43
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I found a few stand close enough </v>

44
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>to the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels just fine.</v>

45
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wear a nice thick,</v>

46
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>like a real good jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.380

<v Speaker 1>will undergarments.</v>

48
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I know it'd be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some people who work in the </v>

49
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.021
<v Speaker 1>industry have to make the cold weather </v>
<v Speaker 1>gear just from my old job and they sent </v>

50
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>me some stuff so it's really not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad and there's some things in life that</v>

51
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I will spend good money on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold weather gear,</v>

52
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>rain gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pony up and pay the extra money </v>

53
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to pay off for you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

54
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it get some real shit.</v>

55
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>My friend Tony Lives in Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>

56
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and he.</v>

57
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>The way he put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes like,</v>

58
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

59
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

60
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you can't really dress for hot weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

61
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could dress for cold weather.</v>

62
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Those you wear warm clothes and cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather,</v>

63
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

64
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>but when it's hot out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking hot out.</v>

65
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You got to go indoors or you can meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

66
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but then once you get to that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

67
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even when you knew that hot,</v>

68
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's like La has no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it gets,</v>

69
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>it gets hot and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rarely rains.</v>

70
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>If it rains 20 days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

71
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what to do inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lie.</v>

72
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was laughing and very happy when you </v>

73
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.751
<v Speaker 1>were posting about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 100 and 506 and Epa we live </v>

74
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>is like 60 beautiful bluebird skies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a breeze.</v>

75
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I bet you get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nighttime starve or looking to right.</v>

76
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.311
<v Speaker 1>Look at what's The star gazing up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard to get out of that light </v>

77
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>pollution you drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.050
<v Speaker 1>we were fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

79
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>probably the reason we moved up there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we bought an investment property in 2016</v>

80
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's in the middle of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably 15 miles out and you want </v>

81
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.171
<v Speaker 1>to talk about no light pollution and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability just to look up and it doesn't </v>

82
00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>look anything unless you've experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

83
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.751
<v Speaker 1>You can't describe how much you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing out if you live in a city </v>

84
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:33.751
<v Speaker 1>looking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

85
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>

86
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:39.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirdest things about </v>

87
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:39.001
<v Speaker 1>civilization that we've chosen to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

88
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I know that a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of talk about people </v>

90
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>having like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>nights or like one time of the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody shut their lights off </v>

92
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>and they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a viewing of the stars,</v>

93
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>like a no light night who's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about doing a step before online.</v>

94
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people organizing light </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution observance day or some shit.</v>

95
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some crazy things online.</v>

96
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I try to try to avoid most of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I hear about online gatherings that</v>

97
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:13.831
<v Speaker 1>started online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I know the picture that I put a view </v>

98
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flying squirrel suit flying over </v>

99
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.771
<v Speaker 1>the fucking earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I purposely chose it because you could </v>

100
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:19.771
<v Speaker 1>see the curvature of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background,</v>

101
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>or can you based on the comex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bro.</v>

102
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Was that shot with the Fisher islands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the Gopro comes with,</v>

103
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that's probably felons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a little bit of a curvature to </v>

104
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that.</v>

105
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that suit.</v>

106
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I was jumping that suit on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It some interesting comments in there.</v>

107
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that has no consequences and</v>

108
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:48.271
<v Speaker 1>allows people to interact in a way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never would if they were sitting across </v>

109
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:48.271
<v Speaker 1>like we are right now.</v>

110
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also requires discipline in that </v>

111
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.621
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way that people communicate </v>

112
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:55.621
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

113
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>there's no discipline in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>conserve,</v>

114
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>like just think about what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

115
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Think about if a person was in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

116
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>think about how it's gonna affect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and then proceed.</v>

117
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that.</v>

118
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say nobody does that,</v>

119
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's few and far between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No consequences.</v>

120
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're an anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

121
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>She just a regular Joe Blow and you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>an egg and it's like,</v>

122
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

123
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

124
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

125
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever your name is and you just feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like talking shit.</v>

126
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

127
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.990
<v Speaker 1>If you put a quarter inch piece of glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between me and another driver on the </v>

128
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.531
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been known to say some interesting </v>

129
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:36.541
<v Speaker 1>things that I wouldn't say to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a line at starbucks if they bumped </v>

130
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:36.541
<v Speaker 1>into me.</v>

131
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what that's from though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say?</v>

132
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

133
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 1>the scientists have studied the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to critical situations where </v>

134
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make split second maneuvers,</v>

135
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.981
<v Speaker 1>like high stress situations and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think of a car as being a high </v>

136
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.611
<v Speaker 1>stress situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're going 70 miles an hour </v>

137
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:56.611
<v Speaker 1>and every little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

138
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>you're way more tuned in than you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

139
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 1>So anything that happens like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker like you,</v>

140
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you're way more ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where road rage comes from.</v>

141
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.350
<v Speaker 1>It comes from the fact that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very aware that you're going to have </v>

142
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>to make split second decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though you don't realize it,</v>

143
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you're at seven all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just ready to flip to 11 when a guy's</v>

144
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker.</v>

145
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen people just lose their </v>

146
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

147
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the really crazy thing.</v>

148
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people lose their shit and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it advert physically escalated,</v>

149
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>like they did pull over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got out of the car.</v>

150
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that be helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be helpless.</v>

151
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how I've been with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

152
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

153
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to fight it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

154
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>You're starting a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

155
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're starting a fight and you're </v>

156
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.731
<v Speaker 1>praying to God or whatever you believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that this person doesn't actually </v>

157
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:48.731
<v Speaker 1>follow you or pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

158
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>they're in a car version of the egg on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

159
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>They just assume like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

160
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:58.091
<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See me again and this isn't real piece </v>

161
00:06:58.091 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it is real.</v>

162
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people duking it out on the </v>

163
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>side of the road and then it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>

164
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go well for both parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally.</v>

165
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.480
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine from Jujitsu pulled over</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the side of the road with a guy once </v>

166
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and they start doing it now and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>both knew how to fight and it was crazy.</v>

167
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.480
<v Speaker 1>They were hitting doubles and sprawling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy goes for a Doris,</v>

168
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:20.481
<v Speaker 1>he reverses them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets side control knees and in the </v>

169
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:20.481
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy fucking hits them at triangle.</v>

170
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 1>They fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he passes the guard like the whole </v>

171
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back and forth on that meeting,</v>

172
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.560
<v Speaker 1>on the fucking grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were on the grass on the side of </v>

173
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.560
<v Speaker 1>the road and then when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both exhausted.</v>

174
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>They high fived each other and then got </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in their car.</v>

175
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>They were laughing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to fight man.</v>

176
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Like it both actually they both rug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck this dude up.</v>

177
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck this dude up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they both were not just,</v>

178
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>not just did they both know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

179
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>They were both at like a purple belt </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

180
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>little impromptu grappling session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Car and punches and kicks and the whole </v>

181
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.011
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have both actually knew how to </v>

182
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:56.111
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty funny the way he was </v>

183
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:56.111
<v Speaker 1>telling it was pretty hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't lie.</v>

185
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get excited when I see people upset in</v>

186
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:05.141
<v Speaker 1>their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they get cut off accidentally </v>

187
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>and I see them getting pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the footage is slowly rolls off the</v>

188
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:12.581
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get really close and I'm doing 40 </v>

189
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>on the freeway and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know.</v>

190
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>My problem is probably just an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the more upset they get,</v>

191
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>the more warmth I feel in my soul as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down the road,</v>

192
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>watching them lose their shit in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

193
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that a guy like you </v>

194
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.951
<v Speaker 1>who's been through so much actual real </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat probably relishes a little </v>

195
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 1>elevation of the normal day to day life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little turn that bitch up a </v>

196
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just crank it up a little bit.</v>

197
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably the last person that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever fight like I just.</v>

198
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And I bet you it's the same with the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

199
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:52.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who make their living in that insane </v>

200
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:52.001
<v Speaker 1>octagon like you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things I do are a little bit</v>

201
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.350
<v Speaker 1>atypical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people who live in the octagon </v>

202
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.350
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely out of their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you</v>

203
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 2>you flew 18 miles and a squirrel suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The suit did most of the work,</v>

204
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just laid in that bed.</v>

205
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter the fucking all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that can go wrong.</v>

206
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 2>What did you say what the temperature </v>
<v Speaker 2>was when he jumped out?</v>

207
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>50 below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 below.</v>

208
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:11.170
<v Speaker 2>With the wind chill and I was rocking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tee shirt,</v>

209
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cold did that get?</v>

210
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't feel my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had hand warmers.</v>

211
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 2>The chemical know the ones that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack open just for like skiing,</v>

212
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't open the bag until 20,000</v>

213
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 2>didn't really think that through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs oxygen,</v>

215
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>open the bag while you're flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like up on the way up.</v>

216
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 2>It was an hour flight to altitude and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew it was going to be cold so I opened</v>

217
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:41.001
<v Speaker 2>up the things and I put them on my hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put my gloves on and send them like </v>

218
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 2>why am I not feeling these heat up?</v>

219
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized that they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen for the chemical reaction.</v>

220
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>So I jumped out and I buy probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>halfway down.</v>

221
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:54.321
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't feel my hand so I just had </v>
<v Speaker 2>them like tucked up behind the wing and </v>

222
00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:57.801
<v Speaker 2>I know where the little small parachute </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you have to pull to deploy your </v>

223
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:57.801
<v Speaker 2>parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

224
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be all right.</v>

225
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I know where this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done this before.</v>

226
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Pulled the parachute and I get on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and then my hands started burning</v>

227
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 2>because the chemical started reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it went from freezing cold hand to </v>

228
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>feeling like I had my hands dipped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>law so I couldn't get the gloves off.</v>

229
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a little</v>

230
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.950
<v Speaker 3>hypothermia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

231
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say they found a guy recently.</v>

232
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say Oregon or Idaho,</v>

233
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them cold places.</v>

234
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went elk hunting and they couldn't </v>

235
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.011
<v Speaker 3>find him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got lost and when they found him he </v>

236
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.681
<v Speaker 3>was dead and he was only like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred yards from his truck and they </v>

237
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 3>think he got snowed out and couldn't see</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was going.</v>

238
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 3>And he had taken his jacket off and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken his gloves and his hat off and </v>

239
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.211
<v Speaker 3>they say that's one of the signs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothermia is you started people in </v>

240
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.591
<v Speaker 3>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the time they take all the </v>

241
00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:48.591
<v Speaker 3>while your fork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just start.</v>

242
00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:48.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit hot too.</v>

243
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just euphoria the,</v>

244
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you get hot or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington state.</v>

245
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Missing elk hunter recovered in </v>

246
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.611
<v Speaker 3>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd heard about another guy who died in </v>

247
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:02.611
<v Speaker 3>Oregon who was a.</v>

248
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 3>He was a tech guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to be on this tech show that I </v>

249
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 3>used to watch and he would review like </v>
<v Speaker 3>gadgets.</v>

250
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:12.541
<v Speaker 3>This was like early two thousands and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>went up with his family and they didn't </v>

251
00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:18.391
<v Speaker 3>have a car that can handle like serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow and they got stuck and they were </v>

252
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:23.341
<v Speaker 3>there for nine days with no food and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>went walking off to get help and froze </v>

253
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Speaker 3>to death in his family was eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescued.</v>

254
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.430
<v Speaker 3>How far did you make it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he made it very far.</v>

255
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean he wasn't wearing the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>

256
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.150
<v Speaker 3>You're wearing regular clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:40.170
<v Speaker 3>and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just desperate and he was trying </v>

258
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.720
<v Speaker 3>to save his family and it's just so sad </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had seen that guy on TV.</v>

259
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:44.650
<v Speaker 3>It was so weird because you see a guy on</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv,</v>

260
00:11:44.651 --> 00:11:48.580
<v Speaker 3>we're reviewing gadgets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's the latest laptop,</v>

261
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 3>like look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the ether net port and what we've</v>

262
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.060
<v Speaker 3>got here is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>the blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah and</v>

264
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 1>all this different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He review like the most technical of </v>

265
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.571
<v Speaker 1>technical things and in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest level of electronic </v>

266
00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>achievements so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

267
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Like the newest gadgets that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

268
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

269
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>when you think about society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

270
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:15.811
<v Speaker 1>you think about those things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile the guy froze to death in the </v>

271
00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the real life.</v>

272
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Speaker 1>All the tech in the world isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save you because you get out into the </v>

273
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.501
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you rely on something that has </v>

274
00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 1>batteries for your sustainment of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

275
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in trouble at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

276
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have baseline skills.</v>

277
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that like when people go into </v>

278
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.961
<v Speaker 1>the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid of grizzly bears and </v>

279
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:39.541
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hypothermia kills more people than </v>

280
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:39.541
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slow too.</v>

282
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the insidious onset of,</v>

283
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet get a little bit cold.</v>

284
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

285
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to some guys who work like </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in Alaska,</v>

286
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's Mckinley Mckinley's in Alaska,</v>

287
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>wherever McKinley is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not uncommon for them to find </v>

288
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>people basically missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're naked because it's that slow</v>

289
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:03.751
<v Speaker 1>that thought process degrades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sweating or take my jacket off and </v>

290
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they just lay down and go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just that one percent of the </v>

291
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.951
<v Speaker 1>time until you are basically a popsicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't your brain pump morphine or </v>

292
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>some equivalent to morphine through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body when you're near death.</v>

293
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're in severe pain or </v>
<v Speaker 1>near death,</v>

294
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>every literally make something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you just go into shock,</v>

295
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical process of what happens </v>

297
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.611
<v Speaker 1>when you go into shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've seen some people that are in a </v>

298
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:35.881
<v Speaker 1>lot of pain and they would have liked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their brain pumping some morphine </v>

299
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:35.881
<v Speaker 1>one happening.</v>

300
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they weren't pumping enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>

301
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd read something about that,</v>

302
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:45.271
<v Speaker 1>that there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was someone who was trying to </v>

303
00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:47.280
<v Speaker 1>explain I'm near death experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like why when people have near death </v>

304
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:53.071
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all these freaky visions and </v>

305
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>some of it they think could be connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to psychedelic chemicals that your brain</v>

306
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are that day.</v>

307
00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Definitely know that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there was also some talk </v>

308
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>about some morphine like substance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain makes.</v>

309
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't surprise me if your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes it was on the downhill slide.</v>

310
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>That'll be the little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dude doesn't need these.</v>

311
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Keep screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

312
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.810
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably just a protection mechanism </v>

313
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:15.810
<v Speaker 1>if anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out there,</v>

315
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.281
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the cool things about </v>

316
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>being in the wilderness is that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

317
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 1>most people just never experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for long stretches and when you do get </v>

318
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>to experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you sort of a like,</v>

319
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought the world was this.</v>

320
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I always thought the world was Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

321
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:37.621
<v Speaker 1>where they drive down the street and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to see your friend and you're in the </v>

322
00:14:37.621 --> 00:14:40.591
<v Speaker 1>car and you go to the movies and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant and then you go to </v>

323
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go wandering through the forest and you </v>

324
00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:47.341
<v Speaker 1>see deer and bears and you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and the quiet and your cell </v>

325
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>phone doesn't work and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

326
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.230
<v Speaker 1>this is the actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have found that it's that in that </v>

327
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>people and including myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that I am this,</v>

328
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you go out into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where you're detached and </v>

329
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.101
<v Speaker 1>then you have to rely upon yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your knowledge and your grid or your </v>

330
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>fortitude and you kind of figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of who you are as well too.</v>

331
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't figure out who you are if you </v>

332
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>live in the greater Los Angeles area.</v>

333
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who you are in Los Angeles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

334
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think he wore in Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>is who you really are?</v>

335
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get to go out and outside </v>

336
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>of that and either rely on yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more importantly,</v>

337
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:31.151
<v Speaker 1>rely on somebody else and have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic outside of you mean you </v>

338
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:36.521
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could starve to death </v>

339
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:36.521
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

340
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:39.040
<v Speaker 1>not have enough water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the places to get those things in </v>

341
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.771
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could solve in a block in either </v>

342
00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:43.991
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go far enough out in the woods and </v>

343
00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:46.571
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's where you find out who </v>

344
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:46.571
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

345
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I like being out there because I get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about me a lot.</v>

346
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real good point that </v>

347
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not who you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

348
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.480
<v Speaker 1>You think you know yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know yourself in the </v>

349
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:58.480
<v Speaker 1>environments that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

350
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.620
<v Speaker 1>The way you really find out who you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to experience a lot of different </v>

351
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 1>environments and a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things.</v>

352
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really know someone until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them tired to see them </v>

353
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungry.</v>

354
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

355
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

356
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the John Dudley is always said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hunting,</v>

357
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>like you think you know a guy take him </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

359
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:23.981

<v Speaker 1>friends for life or I'm never going to </v>

360
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>want to spend another moment with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

369
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>like there is a line.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We should.</v>

372
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 1>We should really be careful if we go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

373
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you know this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the like my friend Adam </v>

374
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Green Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Adam?</v>

375
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>You got to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

376
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely follow him.</v>

377
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker skirts the line.</v>

378
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That's his water buffalo up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

379
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 1>right above the old glory as Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

380
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that your elk from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

381
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>because that one is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's from to hone ranch.</v>

382
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.650
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that rack on that thing.</v>

383
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Adam,</v>

384
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he crosses that line.</v>

385
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 1>He gets to the edge that pushes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>line is how I would describe it.</v>

386
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>He goes out by himself a month at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

387
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but a tent runs out of water all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

388
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Drinks funky water coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got that weird Australia gut </v>

389
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.390
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could just drink water and like,</v>

390
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 1>because some microbes going on or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he's eating in this life.</v>

391
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's festering inside of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

392
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
<v Speaker 1>kills off everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get sick at the fucking guy </v>

393
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.001
<v Speaker 1>drinks at it creaks all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably always just sick and </v>

394
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>that's his normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe is sick.</v>

395
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's happy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

397
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

398
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 3>gets close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he gets close to that edge like </v>

399
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.071
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see that when you watch the </v>

400
00:17:58.071 --> 00:18:00.141
<v Speaker 3>intro instagram story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the grizzly bear kept charging him </v>

401
00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:00.141
<v Speaker 3>and he's fucking filming it all for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Instagram?</v>

402
00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also got an unloaded gun.</v>

403
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I was very upset with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

404
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 3>it was loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had never shot it.</v>

405
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Speaker 3>So was out of battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bullets were the wrong size for the </v>

406
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 3>gun so he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

407
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you can barely see the top of the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at it and you can see the </v>

408
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.020
<v Speaker 3>barrel at the angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the slide is back in like your,</v>

409
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell your.</v>

410
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're pointing your finger at a </v>

411
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.831
<v Speaker 3>bad a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to pull on that as it each </v>

412
00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said the bear ran to 10 yards.</v>

413
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 3>No thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clip 10 yards.</v>

414
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Past false charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten yards.</v>

415
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Speaker 3>He said when you see it running and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the muscles rippling under the hair </v>

416
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.920
<v Speaker 3>and the hair and the snow and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>masters of that claw ripping through the</v>

417
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No thank you.</v>

418
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

419
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 3>he said it was like a nine foot bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's running around and if so if he.</v>

420
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously he's got a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions with animals in the wild,</v>

421
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 3>but if he had run instead of standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>his ground,</v>

422
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 3>he had been fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have attacked him,</v>

423
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

424
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have been fucked.</v>

425
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't because they just have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>instinct.</v>

426
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 3>It would just take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're weak.</v>

427
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're moving away.</v>

428
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Not only you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a threat.</v>

429
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:16.761
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the bear has the opportunity to </v>

430
00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 3>close the distance and the bears don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly know what the fuck you are.</v>

431
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't exactly know what the fuck a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

432
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 3>If they might've seen a person a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>times before,</v>

433
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.300
<v Speaker 3>but they don't eat a person and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck a person.</v>

434
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when a bear does eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person wants a bear,</v>

435
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 3>eats a person like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

436
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I could just fucking eat people </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>

437
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 3>They can't run it like a bear chases on </v>
<v Speaker 3>elk.</v>

438
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a hustle.</v>

439
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine a baird catching an elk.</v>

440
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 3>They do this really crazy video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're eating a moose.</v>

441
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 3>He's chasing this moose and it's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

442
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Barron's chased him around a circle in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

443
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they're filling it from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter and the bear is just this.</v>

444
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 3>This Mousse is hauling ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that Jamie bear.</v>

445
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 3>The fucked up thing is when bears catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

446
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.380
<v Speaker 3>They just eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't kill you first just start.</v>

447
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.390
<v Speaker 3>They just start eating just like they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>a salmon or they grab a salmon and just </v>

448
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>bite into it and pull it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do that to your guts.</v>

449
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I'm really hoping that </v>

450
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 3>morphine thing from your brain is true.</v>

451
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine looking up and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your lower torso inside of the mouth of </v>

452
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>a massive imagining it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so scary.</v>

453
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see the movie grizzly man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

454
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you miss out on the intentional</v>

455
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 3>comedy in the history of the watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

456
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.970
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk?</v>

457
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

458
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:39.771
<v Speaker 3>but people who are gay who don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>admit they're gay run.</v>

459
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:45.110
<v Speaker 3>That's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he decided to go live with the </v>

460
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bears to protect them in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest.</v>

461
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Speaker 3>He got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

462
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.060
<v Speaker 3>I know this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

463
00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

464
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:54.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's a werner herzog film and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if Werner Herzog was trying </v>

465
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 3>to make it funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

466
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 3>And I mean maybe it's just funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

467
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny to me because I have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy appreciation for wildlife and </v>

468
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.800
<v Speaker 3>respect for it and there's part of me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like,</v>

469
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 3>like Steve Rinell had a funny way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this guy.</v>

470
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

471
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 3>you say all you want about that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

472
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 3>that guy was a hard camper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

473
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:19.591
<v Speaker 3>that guy did some hard fucking camp and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was out there for six months at a </v>

474
00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guy got to give respect.</v>

475
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:23.200
<v Speaker 3>You really did live with the bears for </v>
<v Speaker 3>six months at a time,</v>

476
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 3>but we're Herzog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he filmed it,</v>

477
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 3>he filmed like the way he would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>people talking about the guy,</v>

478
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 3>like they go to a sheriff and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheriff's like,</v>

479
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just really digging into that character </v>

480
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:39.860
<v Speaker 3>and plot development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

481
00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just he shows you this guy's</v>

482
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:48.110
<v Speaker 3>ex girlfriend who's crazy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about his life and they </v>

483
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.291
<v Speaker 3>interviewed one of his past roommates or</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guy who knew him in La and he's </v>

484
00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:55.801
<v Speaker 3>talking about how crazy he is and how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of made up a path for himself and </v>

485
00:21:55.801 --> 00:21:59.320
<v Speaker 3>it was just like this really had fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>accents that he would use sometimes.</v>

486
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Just a really bizarre character who </v>
<v Speaker 3>found his identity in taking care air </v>

487
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:10.501
<v Speaker 3>quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of these bears that didn't </v>

488
00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:12.901
<v Speaker 3>need taken care of and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect these barriers and these </v>

489
00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 3>barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just they didn't give a fuck about him.</v>

490
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 3>We had don't think they wanted his </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

491
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>

492
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

493
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 3>the film of him getting eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was filming.</v>

494
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:27.961
<v Speaker 3>Bears had the cover on the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the audio ran and the audio ran for </v>

495
00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

496
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:31.450
<v Speaker 3>if you try to find that audio online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not there,</v>

497
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 3>but there's some fake audio online that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people attribute to it,</v>

498
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 3>but if you listen to it with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>discerning year,</v>

499
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 3>you tell those people aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>

500
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 3>fake screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was seven minutes long of the </v>

501
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 3>bear eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and his girlfriend,</v>

502
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.010
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend hit the bare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend to the bear.</v>

503
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 3>The bear was eating him and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend hit the bear in the head with</v>

504
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 3>a frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't do Jack Shit.</v>

505
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 3>The bear tears her apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

506
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more surprised that he had a </v>

507
00:22:59.490 --> 00:22:59.490
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend who wasn't really a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

508
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 3>It was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a friend who thought she was </v>

509
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 3>referring to worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two words.</v>

510
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends that are gay,</v>

511
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:09.090
<v Speaker 3>that have wives and these poor wives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk around looking like this all </v>

512
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 3>day long like feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck's wrong?</v>

513
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 3>How can this guy doesn't fuck me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like man,</v>

514
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of poor bastards out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just deep in the closet and </v>

515
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not cool.</v>

516
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>That's when we hit that point now where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just kind of do and be a wish.</v>

517
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:25.840
<v Speaker 3>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we were.</v>

518
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I know a couple guys that are deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep in the.</v>

519
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Let me say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

520
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to them.</v>

521
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I talked to them in brief brief chunks </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm,</v>

522
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get this feeling from them where I'm </v>

523
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.790
<v Speaker 3>talking to them where they just want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>end the conversation before I go,</v>

524
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you gay?</v>

525
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Like every conversation is like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>really quick,</v>

526
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 3>really quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really quick.</v>

527
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good to see.</v>

528
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

529
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 3>take it easy man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See you next time.</v>

530
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

531
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 3>before you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you good?</v>

532
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Are you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

533
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a bomber man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bummer.</v>

534
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to get to get to 2017 and not </v>

535
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.690
<v Speaker 3>have that worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me to be a travesty that the</v>

536
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.530
<v Speaker 3>fact that people give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

537
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Why does anybody care what other choices</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they make in their life?</v>

538
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my theory has been there's two types of </v>

539
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 3>people that care about gay marriage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is people who are really dumb,</v>

540
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 3>or people that are secretly worried that</v>
<v Speaker 3>digs are delicious.</v>

541
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I can get behind that campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my theory.</v>

542
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 3>That was one of my old bits and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you know,</v>

543
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:37.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people are afraid that other </v>

544
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.311
<v Speaker 3>people gonna think they're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is people who grew up where </v>

545
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:42.701
<v Speaker 3>they hear terrible things about gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people or prejudice people around them </v>

546
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.250
<v Speaker 3>tell them crazy things about gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize that gay people were </v>

547
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.040
<v Speaker 3>just people that like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

548
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 3>And there's other guys that like guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

549
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And if everything was open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't feel so creepy.</v>

550
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.500
<v Speaker 3>They feel creepy because they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hide it and be secretive and always be </v>

551
00:24:59.500 --> 00:24:59.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's forbidden or there.</v>

552
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where the weirdness comes </v>

553
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:04.900
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go to Santa Monica Boulevard,</v>

554
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.510
<v Speaker 3>there's these fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this area of like three blocks </v>

555
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 3>in West Hollywood and Santa Monica </v>
<v Speaker 3>Boulevard that I don't get out of my </v>

556
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

557
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>loading the scenario up.</v>

558
00:25:14.771 --> 00:25:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm already thinking in my head like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going here.</v>

559
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever go to willow's wild animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>parks where we stay in the car and the </v>

560
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 3>monkeys jumped on your car and rip your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking windshield wipers off?</v>

561
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have those New Jersey went?</v>

562
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

563
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 3>The monkeys jumped on your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it happens anymore,</v>

564
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 3>but they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to be there and you know,</v>

565
00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:37.790
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to like agree that the monkey</v>
<v Speaker 3>might fuck your car,</v>

566
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.800
<v Speaker 3>can sign a waiver when you get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't go there with a Ferrari until</v>

567
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 3>connect with a car that could get jacked</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these monkeys,</v>

568
00:25:43.791 --> 00:25:48.791
<v Speaker 3>my Jack your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you would be around these animals </v>

569
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:48.791
<v Speaker 3>and you'd stay in your vehicle the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire time.</v>

570
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 3>They have one in China and it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

571
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a year ago this lady was in an </v>

572
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 3>argument with her boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

573
00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.311
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she got out of the car and she went </v>

574
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 3>around the car and she was yelling at </v>
<v Speaker 3>him in a fucking tiger came.</v>

575
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.710
<v Speaker 3>You posted that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that and just yanked her away.</v>

576
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:11.711
<v Speaker 3>And then the tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then someone else chased after and </v>

577
00:26:11.711 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 3>apparently she lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but her mom died.</v>

578
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Her mom was going out trying to save her</v>
<v Speaker 3>saber from the tiger and the tiger </v>

579
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 3>killed her mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stumped bitch just thought she was.</v>

580
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.630
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it in my head.</v>

581
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking say what I want and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get out of this car.</v>

582
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she gets out of her car and she does</v>

583
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:31.541
<v Speaker 3>it in a wild animal park filled with 800</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound tigers.</v>

584
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 3>If you do stupid things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to win stupid prizes.</v>

585
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.010
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how quick the tiger seizes </v>
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity though from that video.</v>

586
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:45.011
<v Speaker 3>She was only on the driver's side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>car for a few seconds so them lights </v>

587
00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:45.011
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull that out,</v>

588
00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 3>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great video to watch.</v>

589
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.560
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like I don't want anybody to </v>

590
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 3>get killed by a tire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't,</v>

591
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:57.290
<v Speaker 3>but I do want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone gets killed by a tiger doing </v>

592
00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.051
<v Speaker 3>something really fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do want everybody to watch that and </v>

593
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:00.051
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

594
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This ain't the lion king motherfucker.</v>

595
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 3>This shit's real like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

596
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets out of the car,</v>

597
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 3>the Wildlife Zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets out.</v>

598
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Watch passenger side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back seat.</v>

599
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine the argument going on in </v>

600
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.240
<v Speaker 3>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Outta here.</v>

601
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

602
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired of your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She runs around the other side.</v>

603
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Going to make one more point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy's like,</v>

604
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:19.460
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you just fucking relaxed?</v>

605
00:27:19.461 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't hit me.</v>

606
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Don't hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

607
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Get back in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat.</v>

608
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Jason just drags her lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He runs out of the car.</v>

609
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the mom ones out and that </v>

610
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.671
<v Speaker 3>lady's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third lady Dayton is a rangers come </v>

611
00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to try to save her.</v>

612
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the move is close.</v>

613
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 3>All doors roll up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windows think grabs are so quick.</v>

614
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I've wanted.</v>

615
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired of eating a whole meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>served on an aluminum tray.</v>

616
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you for keeping me here.</v>

617
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

618
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 3>I think if they fed those tigers wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

619
00:27:57.511 --> 00:27:59.640
<v Speaker 3>they probably wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably wouldn't give a shit about</v>

620
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 3>that lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they do is they give the Tigers</v>

621
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:05.930
<v Speaker 3>no animal reward to have an animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>reward system right there.</v>

622
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 3>The tigers jobs to clean up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of this one.</v>

623
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 3>This tiger flying through the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

624
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rip.</v>

625
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 3>This guy's hand apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just flew up to the top of and he </v>

626
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:19.940
<v Speaker 3>listened some fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

627
00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:24.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking to his hand </v>

628
00:28:24.941 --> 00:28:24.941
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That tigers don't play,</v>

629
00:28:24.941 --> 00:28:28.071
<v Speaker 3>but if you let that tiger killed things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if they let a bunch of axis deer </v>

630
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which that demands,</v>

631
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 3>that would be what they look for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would chase down the deer,</v>

632
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 3>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live like natural,</v>

633
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 3>but so they have this overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire.</v>

634
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a way to put it.</v>

635
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.610
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

636
00:28:42.611 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 3>If like if you were a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good way to put it.</v>

637
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a guy and they extracted all </v>

638
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 3>the come from your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they kept you horny,</v>

639
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 3>but that wouldn't make sense.</v>

640
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bailed on it.</v>

641
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

642
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad analogy.</v>

643
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Do don't run with that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these animals,</v>

644
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:08.050
<v Speaker 3>they get their appetite satisfied but </v>
<v Speaker 3>not their appetite to kill their deal.</v>

645
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.080
<v Speaker 3>They're born like you roll a yarn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roll a ball of yarn in front of a </v>

646
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.121
<v Speaker 3>kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking cat dives on it because that's </v>

647
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:17.121
<v Speaker 3>what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This supposed to attack things.</v>

648
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 3>They have a bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even little flirt,</v>

649
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:24.021
<v Speaker 3>fluffy little kittens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a built in desire to attack </v>

650
00:29:24.021 --> 00:29:28.461
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why people are the way </v>

651
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:31.461
<v Speaker 3>they are and social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the release that the </v>

652
00:29:31.461 --> 00:29:31.461
<v Speaker 3>human body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul,</v>

653
00:29:31.461 --> 00:29:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you want to describe it,</v>

654
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:37.761
<v Speaker 3>is designed to get somewhere else and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you get it from as a device through </v>

655
00:29:37.761 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>other people's pictures are selected </v>
<v Speaker 3>posts,</v>

656
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I think you go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

657
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 2>is why I don't trust nearly every human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being on the face of the planet.</v>

658
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they get the chance to </v>

659
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 2>express who they want to be.</v>

660
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

661
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 3>I agree 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think um,</v>

662
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking a lot about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole boss,</v>

663
00:29:56.991 --> 00:30:01.991
<v Speaker 3>employee sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual harassment thing that's been </v>

664
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:05.381
<v Speaker 3>going on every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something else comes on and it's always </v>

665
00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:08.561
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always a man in power in a woman </v>

666
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:11.630
<v Speaker 3>who works for him and something goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and it's never the opposite.</v>

667
00:30:11.631 --> 00:30:14.780
<v Speaker 3>It's never chicks getting their pussy by</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dude who works in the office.</v>

668
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 3>It's never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of women that are ceos or </v>

669
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.900
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been reported yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys can keep their mouth shut.</v>

670
00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:25.901
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the guy doesn't consider that to be </v>

671
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:25.901
<v Speaker 3>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

672
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:25.901
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

673
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 3>she lets you fuck her and she buys your </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

674
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a mustang the fuck you go to the </v>

675
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 3>New York Post for.</v>

676
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that almost came out of my nose.</v>

677
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.600
<v Speaker 3>But if it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think this is what I think.</v>

678
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of males right in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>male in a position of power,</v>

679
00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:52.901
<v Speaker 3>like the chief of the village,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that guy would probably have his </v>

680
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:54.090
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the war Lord.</v>

681
00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:59.091
<v Speaker 3>He had this choice of women and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women would respond to him in a </v>

682
00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:01.850
<v Speaker 3>favorable way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would let him know.</v>

683
00:31:01.851 --> 00:31:03.900
<v Speaker 3>It would indicate to him that it's time </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck right,</v>

684
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.480
<v Speaker 3>this girl wants it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give it to her.</v>

685
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 3>So when a guy is like some Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein guy or someone who's at the </v>

686
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.760
<v Speaker 3>front of some giant company and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the office kisses his ass when he's </v>

687
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.900
<v Speaker 3>there and everyone's so happy to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and people are angling for,</v>

688
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 3>for raises and they're angling for </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotions and they're always nice to </v>

689
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.211
<v Speaker 3>him and they treated him like royalty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy start thinking that </v>

690
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:29.840
<v Speaker 3>these girls are attracted to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

691
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.840
<v Speaker 3>That he's going to fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a power thing,</v>

692
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:38.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like a trick on the reward</v>
<v Speaker 3>system that the brain has and then it's </v>

693
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.680
<v Speaker 3>a scumbag thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a lot of factors in there.</v>

694
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot tied to the power </v>

695
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

696
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I cannot think of an example of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation that doesn't have that </v>

697
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 2>problem somewhere near the apex,</v>

698
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a man gets in power,</v>

699
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 3>just power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think power.</v>

700
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that as</v>

701
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.280
<v Speaker 2>humans we're only capable of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with so much fill in the blank when it </v>

702
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.811
<v Speaker 2>comes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the money or the fame or </v>

703
00:32:06.811 --> 00:32:06.811
<v Speaker 2>people throwing themselves at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at some point,</v>

704
00:32:06.811 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 2>depending on the moral compass that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have and how it's calibrated,</v>

705
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:14.011
<v Speaker 2>it ends up swinging in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction because you can look at </v>

706
00:32:14.011 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 2>physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could look at religion,</v>

707
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>you can look at people in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generals in the number of sexual assault</v>

708
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 2>cases and the generals like a one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>four star generals in the US in 2017 was</v>

709
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 2>insanely high to comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Cosby to,</v>

710
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fill in the blank.</v>

711
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:34.150
<v Speaker 2>You can find an example everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you start getting to the apex,</v>

712
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a disconnect on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

713
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>depending on who you are going into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

714
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a disconnect on how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can handle</v>

715
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 3>because we was a really weird one </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I.</v>

716
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 3>I've had this theory for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that during cosby's era,</v>

717
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.480
<v Speaker 3>the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was not just common to drug </v>

718
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was almost like a joke like that.</v>

719
00:32:56.421 --> 00:33:01.421
<v Speaker 3>People thought it was funny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs were fairly fairly new and the </v>

720
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:07.001
<v Speaker 3>consequences of sexual assault warrant </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about and it wasn't thought about</v>

721
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 3>the same way and I think that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>during that day,</v>

722
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 3>like he used to joke around about it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his act.</v>

723
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 3>I remember you saying that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

724
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 3>He had these Spanish Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

725
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.030
<v Speaker 3>and he even had a section,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a segment or a scene on the cosby show </v>

726
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.550
<v Speaker 3>where someone would give something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that would make them have sex </v>

727
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 3>with them or he would put them to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>with something.</v>

728
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Like he would joke around about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had joked around about it on talk </v>

729
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:36.650
<v Speaker 3>shows and stuff.</v>

730
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

731
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think that when you talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who was around during the 19 </v>

732
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.691
<v Speaker 3>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to call it slip and so under </v>

733
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:46.691
<v Speaker 3>Mickey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have heard the term before?</v>

734
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they just once and shit started </v>

735
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 3>coming out and they start giving them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just slip it in tow so fucked up.</v>

736
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 3>So fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it still happens,</v>

737
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To this day it's still happens.</v>

738
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.400
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had these girls on the podcast the </v>

739
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:03.400
<v Speaker 3>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

740
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm Korean and Christina from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast guys we fucked and one of them </v>

741
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:10.061
<v Speaker 3>was saying that she was hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy and she had a drink and then </v>

742
00:34:10.061 --> 00:34:14.291
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden she just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking controllers got into a cab or </v>

743
00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:14.291
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

744
00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 3>And rescued her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had your hands full with those two.</v>

745
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.360
<v Speaker 3>That was like crazy.</v>

746
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.360
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to me like you had to wet cats</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a paper bag when she was talking </v>

747
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 3>about I had an anal anal orgasms with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrator.</v>

748
00:34:26.121 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

752
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:32.300
<v Speaker 3>I think folding laundry in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

753
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fun.</v>

755
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:43.260
<v Speaker 3>It was an entertaining podcast for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are girls that talk publicly the </v>

756
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 3>way girls talk privately when they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple drinks in them.</v>

757
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

758
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 3>and that's what's so attractive about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their podcast.</v>

759
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the term to use.</v>

760
00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Bravery or whatever it is to be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>open and honest and like just fuck it.</v>

761
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blank slate.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's what I might like.</v>

764
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's appealing though.</v>

765
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 3>When someone does do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone you can tell you like,</v>

766
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is actually there.</v>

767
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:14.870

<v Speaker 3>honest with no repercussions or horses.</v>

768
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.050

<v Speaker 3>hold of her pictures and you know,</v>

773
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:31.640

<v Speaker 3>Scarlett Johansson.</v>

777
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:42.351

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

781

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:39.890
<v Speaker 3>fricking winning at every turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize.</v>

802
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Didn't realize you had the high five and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old tiger blood.</v>

803
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

804
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 3>the high five that he got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

805
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 3>apparently is what started that whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing off.</v>

806
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.710
<v Speaker 3>What is insanity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

807
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:50.630
<v Speaker 3>sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

808
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

809
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that when he was diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with HIV was right when he started going</v>

810
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:57.690
<v Speaker 3>wild and talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

811
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 3>snorting and smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight grams of crack and that's how I </v>

812
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Speaker 3>roll and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

813
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

814
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:07.470
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure when you start off bat shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

815
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't help and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseline,</v>

816
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 3>but you remember how people reacted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that though.</v>

817
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.780
<v Speaker 3>They will like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

818
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 3>tell us what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie.</v>

819
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did a Goddamn tour of theaters and he</v>

820
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 3>didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even sit down.</v>

821
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 3>He would sit down and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

822
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 3>so just got done smoking an eight ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he would tell stories,</v>

823
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 3>but they had to craft what the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be.</v>

824
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:32.540
<v Speaker 3>See what started out was he was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go in this theater tour and </v>

825
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>he's probably on copd if I talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

826
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.360
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna love us and he didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>really what to do.</v>

827
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:41.390
<v Speaker 3>So the first couple of shows were a </v>
<v Speaker 3>total disaster and then he started </v>

828
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:46.011
<v Speaker 3>bringing comics in there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like my friend Russell Peters did a </v>

829
00:37:46.011 --> 00:37:49.371
<v Speaker 3>bunch of them with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would go up for a little bit then </v>

830
00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:49.371
<v Speaker 3>go up or like what kind of host the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

831
00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was comic and then trolley and </v>

832
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.771
<v Speaker 3>they were sitting down talking and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you get to hear Charlie's wild </v>

833
00:37:57.771 --> 00:37:57.771
<v Speaker 3>stories and talking crazy shit.</v>

834
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.900
<v Speaker 3>But the comic would frame it all with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some actual comedy and comedy and </v>

835
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.120
<v Speaker 3>comedic relaxed reaction to this maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they keep it on the rails and </v>

836
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Russell's great comic and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly great at talking like </v>

837
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 3>talking shit and ad libbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Russell's a great.</v>

838
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of crowd work and his act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's like super fast and speedy and </v>

839
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Russell brand's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russell Peters,</v>

840
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Russell brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is another guy he's an absolute </v>

841
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:27.830
<v Speaker 3>hands full with on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

842
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.550
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a character.</v>

843
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't get that guy coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

844
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 3>he had a lot of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

845
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:33.960
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a drug free character.</v>

846
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Choke Free Soda of.</v>

847
00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

848
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.200
<v Speaker 1>now drug free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy did enough drugs to kill all </v>

849
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:42.200
<v Speaker 1>three of us in this room probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived.</v>

850
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless him.</v>

851
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got a story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

852
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but he's another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty free,</v>

853
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like with who he is now,</v>

854
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:51.130
<v Speaker 1>he's free and he's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe the transparency.</v>

855
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

856
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the courage to just be like,</v>

857
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

858
00:38:57.311 --> 00:39:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's just unzip the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay it out and here we are.</v>

859
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 1>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't try.</v>

860
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I bet you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

861
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I try my luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the podcast,</v>

862
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 1>my rule is I just try to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I try to do is just be honest</v>

863
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:15.721
<v Speaker 1>and portray myself as I am and say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I actually believe and not </v>

864
00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>try to add one percent to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still some people were,</v>

865
00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 1>if they were to ask me some questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

866
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:20.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for another day.</v>

867
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:26.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to answer every single </v>

868
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.030
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also,</v>

869
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 1>especially if it comes to like military </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

870
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff you can answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll then you just make stuff up.</v>

871
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what you do?</v>

872
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that going on,</v>

873
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of that going on,</v>

874
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:39.121
<v Speaker 1>which is why most of the time I try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispel misconceptions.</v>

875
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:44.161
<v Speaker 1>The reality is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really nothing that I've ever </v>

876
00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:46.291
<v Speaker 1>done that you can't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any books or anything that's </v>

877
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:50.461
<v Speaker 1>ever come out where you knew one story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you saw come on and you're </v>

878
00:39:50.461 --> 00:39:54.691
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have gone to the bookstore and read </v>

879
00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:59.011
<v Speaker 1>books written by an individual who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were on a combat operation that I </v>

880
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>was on and don't remember seeing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

881
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

882
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue.</v>

883
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 99 point nine percent of </v>

884
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.331
<v Speaker 1>books that have a trident on them should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be purchased and then put next to your </v>

885
00:40:18.331 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 1>toilet paper roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you run out of toilet paper,</v>

886
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you can just start ripping pages out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books,</v>

887
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.500
<v Speaker 1>wipe your ass with pride and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that symbol is the symbol that </v>

888
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 1>is associated with being a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

889
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

890
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.420
<v Speaker 1>when you get that symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they change your designator inside of </v>

891
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the navy system and it registers as a 53</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 26,</v>

892
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 1>which is why do you think you see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>using that trident?</v>

893
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Because it's recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it because they're </v>

894
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:42.660
<v Speaker 1>bullshit artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it.</v>

895
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say exactly why they're doing </v>

896
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.321
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some people are doing it purely </v>

897
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.601
<v Speaker 1>to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people got out or a little bit </v>

898
00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:54.150
<v Speaker 1>early and have used the recognizability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that mark to further their own </v>

899
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.490
<v Speaker 1>motives down the road and a purely 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent profit seeking other people are </v>

900
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.570
<v Speaker 1>there trying to tell I guess would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>their story or their version of a story </v>

901
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.621
<v Speaker 1>and that would be the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and then I guess on the other </v>

902
00:41:10.621 --> 00:41:13.411
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best example I point people at as </v>

903
00:41:13.411 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 1>generally Jockos book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a book about hey,</v>

904
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

905
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.680
<v Speaker 1>There I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the number one indicator of a </v>

906
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 1>store at this completely false as la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we were like,</v>

907
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

908
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Why is that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to romanticize and embellish</v>

909
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the reality of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what actually happened and I don't </v>

910
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>know if it's the desire to make it seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's</v>

911
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 2>more than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's because most of the</v>

912
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 2>time when you're coming from a military </v>
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>

913
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:40.170
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

914
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 2>You're not used to any level with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

915
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I would call it fan ship I guess or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what I mean?</v>

916
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:50.831
<v Speaker 2>Like it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the military and being in the </v>

917
00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:52.580
<v Speaker 2>military is not about money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:57.581
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pull up online and see exactly </v>

919
00:41:57.581 --> 00:42:00.191
<v Speaker 2>how much every individual in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military is making based off what rank </v>

920
00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:00.191
<v Speaker 2>they are and how many years they've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

921
00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:01.820
<v Speaker 2>So people will be approached and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

922
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 2>this is how much money you could make if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wrote a book and they're like,</v>

923
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.650
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

924
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 2>And so they will and they'll make </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>

925
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is if you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>embellishing those stories,</v>

926
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.700
<v Speaker 2>in my mind at least it starts tarnishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of what the occupation </v>

927
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>actually is and the in the good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes amazing things that happen </v>

928
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.030
<v Speaker 2>lose a lot of their value in my mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's an enticement that </v>

929
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 2>guys are not used to inside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>

930
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.380
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in the military,</v>

931
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel like I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie before we started.</v>

932
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm late to everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>late to social media.</v>

933
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:38.561
<v Speaker 2>I'm late to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never listened to a podcast </v>

934
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:38.561
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat down and met you with tate.</v>

935
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never listened to one.</v>

936
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that diversity of </v>

937
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.360
<v Speaker 2>information that is out there and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go and,</v>

938
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 2>and I mean you can almost get like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

939
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.520
<v Speaker 2>an advanced degree in whatever it is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get by just going.</v>

940
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never listened to one because I was so </v>

941
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 2>focused on something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you lift your head up from that</v>

942
00:42:57.681 --> 00:43:00.980
<v Speaker 2>world and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on around here?</v>

943
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you post the right pictures on social</v>

944
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:09.761
<v Speaker 2>media that you and your outfit with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand yard stare off into the </v>

945
00:43:09.761 --> 00:43:12.821
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get more followers and then </v>

946
00:43:12.821 --> 00:43:12.821
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

947
00:43:12.821 --> 00:43:12.821
<v Speaker 2>come and speak and say.</v>

948
00:43:12.821 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an enticing thing to individuals in</v>

949
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 2>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just not used to that.</v>

950
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 2>And it can really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can really.</v>

951
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it can take you down a path that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend most people don't </v>

952
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:26.440
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I like the way Jocko,</v>

953
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:31.331
<v Speaker 2>when as he has experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's trying to take those </v>

954
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:33.731
<v Speaker 2>experiences in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>portray them in a way that people can </v>

955
00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 2>make use of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the story,</v>

956
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:38.981
<v Speaker 2>it's about what he learned during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and how you can implement that in </v>

957
00:43:38.981 --> 00:43:41.951
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a broad spectrum of </v>

958
00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:44.501
<v Speaker 2>everything from literally rip off pages </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wipe your ass to recommend to </v>

959
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:47.860
<v Speaker 2>anybody that I encounter that asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about [inaudible].</v>

960
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 2>New Book is fantastic and it's so short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's an easy read.</v>

961
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it so fantastic book </v>
<v Speaker 2>could change your life because if those.</v>

962
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Those quotes are from a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirational guy,</v>

963
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really trying to really be.</v>

964
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I would say he's not trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirational.</v>

965
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:09.410
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote down in committed to paper the </v>

966
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.560
<v Speaker 2>principles that he uses to live his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

967
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>his passion and his enthusiasm for </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting up at 4:30</v>

968
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and working out </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented for like a week.</v>

969
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I was getting up a few minutes before </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and I would just post on twitter </v>

970
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 2>like up before Jocko,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag don't be lazy,</v>

971
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and then I got fucking tired and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>

972
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll get up earlier.</v>

973
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.520
<v Speaker 2>He will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

974
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:30.890
<v Speaker 2>of course he was liking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

975
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to elicit</v>

976
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.590
<v Speaker 1>a response out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jocko.</v>

977
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He led.</v>

978
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because if people were asked you,</v>

979
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.550
<v Speaker 1>they will still ask me are I think I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>still ask them if we know each other and</v>

980
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I've known him forever and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

981
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't call how Jocko like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

982
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gonna be all right.</v>

983
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 1>If I make funky Jocko on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be all right.</v>

984
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 1>He's got a good sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

985
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Well especially if you know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to get pissed about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his father was like,</v>

987
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:58.250
<v Speaker 1>this is a funny man just because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have at for 29.</v>

988
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a lazy bitch ahead and</v>

989
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:07.491
<v Speaker 1>then I have to stop myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's as far as I can go on twitter </v>

990
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:07.491
<v Speaker 1>because I will lose my mind and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be that person.</v>

991
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't respond to many people.</v>

992
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 1>You have like a minimum or a maximum </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement per day.</v>

993
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Just give yourself like a threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at three different comments </v>

994
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.850
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how you could </v>

995
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.530
<v Speaker 1>possibly keep track or even tabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your numbers are astronomical.</v>

996
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't keep track.</v>

997
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I dip my toe into the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>of social media,</v>

998
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be like an abstract painting</v>

999
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 1>rolling by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like 60 miles an hour.</v>

1000
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 1>You can probably just catch one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that comes by.</v>

1001
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between working out,</v>

1002
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.040
<v Speaker 1>writing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing stand up,</v>

1003
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>be with my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

1004
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Anything else I'm doing at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the fucking time.</v>

1005
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 1>UFC duties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I have to do with doc.</v>

1007
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

1008
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:56.550
<v Speaker 1>So you're tapped out?</v>

1009
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do what I can.</v>

1010
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I post stuff and then I get out of there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plus I don't the turmoil,</v>

1011
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the P,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like,</v>

1012
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you can engage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1013
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you,</v>

1014
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

1015
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 1>If you respond to every barking dog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get where you're going,</v>

1016
00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>if you ever heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>

1017
00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I paraphrased it,</v>

1018
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's the idea behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way you don't have the </v>

1019
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.751
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have friends that have less </v>

1020
00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 1>followers who will go like my friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>Owen Benjamin.</v>

1021
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

1022
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 1>he'll have twitter fights all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told him the other day,</v>

1023
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

1024
00:46:29.291 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop engaging.</v>

1025
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 1>We got to stop doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It entice people.</v>

1026
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Once they recognize that you engage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would entice them to hit you up more.</v>

1027
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your time is you're done.</v>

1028
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll try to piss you off and</v>

1029
00:46:41.011 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 1>then you'd go back and forth with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:46:42.781 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 1>well fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the morning checking your twitter </v>

<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

1035
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't know how to take </v>

1036
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.050
<v Speaker 1>how long do you think you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>last?</v>

1038
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The winter to the end up keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in San Diego and just coming back </v>

1039
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>here in November?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1040
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I have really not thought about San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego since the day that we left and I </v>

1041
00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.721
<v Speaker 1>am with tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snowed in will be like a good five feet </v>

1042
00:47:17.721 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 1>cold weather stuff and I got guys truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a truck.</v>

1043
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a F150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1044
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Slightly modified though.</v>

1045
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacked up.</v>

1046
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 1>A little lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's came tested.</v>

1047
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five big 750 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mud and snow tires.</v>

1048
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Probably 750 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1049
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.580
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do you have in the hood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shelby supercharger.</v>

1050
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went.</v>

1051
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>You went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came that way.</v>

1052
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:47.731
<v Speaker 1>My wife was so pissed at me because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went in with my other f-150 to get an </v>

1053
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 1>oil change and I technically did get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil change because I came home with this</v>

1054
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 1>truck and she walked outside and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like God.</v>

1055
00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.650
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of those like super sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance trucks,</v>

1056
00:47:59.651 --> 00:48:01.100
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have street tires on them.</v>

1057
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Mine have massive knobby tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally went in,</v>

1058
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:11.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got very fortunate and I got a great </v>

1059
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:13.720
<v Speaker 1>deal on a Ford on like a pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 1>endorsement sponsorship thing earlier.</v>

1060
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So I had a bunch of equity in my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally went in to get an oil change</v>

1061
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 1>and right next to me in this spot was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Ford f150 black ops model,</v>

1062
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.580
<v Speaker 1>like the Tuscan Tuscany so hard.</v>

1063
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.080
<v Speaker 1>And I get out of my truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I usually feel good and then I'm </v>

1064
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:31.930
<v Speaker 1>looking up at this other truck and now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately feel like bitch.</v>

1065
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I climbed up on the wheel and I'm </v>

1066
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:37.320
<v Speaker 1>just reading the sticker because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read it from the ground.</v>

1067
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1068
00:48:39.761 --> 00:48:44.761
<v Speaker 1>well that price is totally outside of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>range and I go inside and of course the </v>

1069
00:48:44.761 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 1>salesman happened to see me and he comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>over to the service side of the,</v>

1070
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm getting now given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy my keys,</v>

1071
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that truck?</v>

1072
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing's awesome man.</v>

1073
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1074
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:54.460
<v Speaker 1>let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just run the numbers.</v>

1075
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Like okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four hours later I'm going home and the </v>

1076
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.801
<v Speaker 1>new truck for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took you four hours in the </v>

1077
00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:01.801
<v Speaker 1>dealership.</v>

1078
00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 1>You wives call it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck are you?</v>

1079
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does that because that's not the </v>

1080
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>first time it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1081
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you've done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy.</v>

1082
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I tried to buy her a car one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her I was taking her minivan in </v>

1083
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Honda Odyssey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Best urban assault vehicle ever dual </v>

1084
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.230
<v Speaker 1>open doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just take down a compound and </v>

1085
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.230
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have blacked out windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't store some rocket launchers </v>

1087
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 1>on top of that bitch and just roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

1088
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:27.451
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you want me to take you in and </v>

1089
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:27.451
<v Speaker 1>take your car and get an oil change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting her a Tahoe and like three</v>

1090
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:28.780
<v Speaker 1>hours and she starts calling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1091
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1092
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they found a leak in your flux </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacitor.</v>

1093
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a few more minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit shit about cars,</v>

1094
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 1>but the future.</v>

1095
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1096
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 1>so I come home and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1097
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:43.441
<v Speaker 1>I like that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong color and the different </v>

1098
00:49:43.441 --> 00:49:43.441
<v Speaker 1>seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1099
00:49:43.441 --> 00:49:43.441
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she went back and picked out her own.</v>

1100
00:49:43.441 --> 00:49:44.800
<v Speaker 1>So after a couple hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dealership,</v>

1101
00:49:44.801 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I think she realized something was up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got in trouble for that.</v>

1102
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video where they were comparing </v>

1103
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 1>that shelby supercharged f-150 to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>raptor.</v>

1104
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to figure out which one</v>
<v Speaker 1>was better.</v>

1105
00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that truck is ready to go </v>

1106
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 1>for the winter time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got some big old tires,</v>

1107
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:08.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entirely too much torque and power </v>

1108
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.120
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1109
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1110
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.780
<v Speaker 1>break loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locking differentials and all that jazz.</v>

1111
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.880
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm locking differentials means you can </v>

1112
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.101
<v Speaker 1>like you have an arb locking </v>
<v Speaker 1>differential and what you do is you set </v>

1113
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it so that all wheels will always spin </v>
<v Speaker 1>together no matter what.</v>

1114
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 1>So it locks together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're,</v>

1115
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a place where one wheel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning,</v>

1116
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't</v>

1117
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v Speaker 3>work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All wheel spin together and it's not </v>

1118
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.521
<v Speaker 3>good for driving down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good for getting you out of </v>

1119
00:50:36.521 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 3>places and for traversing very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrain.</v>

1120
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It might have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have fucked that up,</v>

1121
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:46.570
<v Speaker 3>but locking differentials are a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a must on any sort of off road </v>

1122
00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 3>vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never planned to tick it off road even</v>

1123
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:51.560
<v Speaker 3>though I think it's designed for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zombie apocalypse.</v>

1124
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 3>I tried to baby that thing and just park</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the garage.</v>

1125
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if you have to like what if you</v>

1126
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 3>have to go into the forest to get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>elk.</v>

1127
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 3>If you're packing out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called somebody else who's a trail,</v>

1128
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 3>some sort of logging trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call somebody else,</v>

1129
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 3>bring their truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can use it in Montana.</v>

1130
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually thinking about that to </v>

1131
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 3>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1132
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what I'd use it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like to have it,</v>

1133
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I would be more prepared for</v>
<v Speaker 3>life in general with the window.</v>

1134
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:23.060
<v Speaker 3>My Bronco has a wrench,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't suck and that thing's bad ass.</v>

1135
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Never going to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they were telling me how the winch,</v>

1136
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:28.480
<v Speaker 3>where's my Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking thinking.</v>

1137
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.390
<v Speaker 3>The confidence that you have gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing into.</v>

1138
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.840
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a winch,</v>

1139
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 3>a winch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing can stop me.</v>

1140
00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 3>What the folks got stomped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to winch.</v>

1141
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can pull something out of a ditch.</v>

1142
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.950
<v Speaker 3>That's like a man thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like men want equipment.</v>

1143
00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to use liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should always have a chainsaw.</v>

1144
00:51:42.171 --> 00:51:47.171
<v Speaker 3>Just in case 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You live in a fucking apartment in New </v>

1145
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:47.171
<v Speaker 3>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have a chainsaw?</v>

1146
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might have to cut down the door.</v>

1147
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Shit goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straight goes sideways.</v>

1148
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Now trees start growing everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're ready for winter,</v>

1149
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we got the ski pass is ready to go,</v>

1150
00:51:57.771 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>I can see worldclass skiing from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>son's bedroom mountain.</v>

1151
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:07.210
<v Speaker 3>We live just south of white fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in white fish the mountain is called </v>

1152
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.570
<v Speaker 3>big mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not big sky.</v>

1153
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Most people confuse the two big skies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bozeman.</v>

1154
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I think you said you had been to big sky</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1155
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:17.411
<v Speaker 3>I've been to Bozeman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bozeman has big sky makes guys like </v>

1156
00:52:17.411 --> 00:52:21.341
<v Speaker 3>right outside of Bose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just south of incorrect and white fish </v>

1157
00:52:21.341 --> 00:52:21.341
<v Speaker 3>is just north of where we live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kalispell.</v>

1158
00:52:21.341 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And a big mountain is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be open in four days.</v>

1159
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.900
<v Speaker 3>We went to Bozeman and we were there </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have this,</v>

1160
00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this grizzly sanctuary.</v>

1161
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 3>We took a ride to yellowstone and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped the grizzly sanctuary.</v>

1162
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And the other bucket bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so big they don't even look like</v>

1163
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:42.491
<v Speaker 3>they're real and they throw them frozen </v>
<v Speaker 3>watermelons and that's what they're </v>

1164
00:52:42.491 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 3>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A whole frozen watermelon.</v>

1165
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.720
<v Speaker 3>So they throw this frozen because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot out and we went in the summer and </v>

1166
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 3>the bear just this giant block of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1167
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:52.780
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1168
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge beach ball of ice that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 20 pounder.</v>

1169
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 3>The bear just opens his mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crushes it with one bite,</v>

1170
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.100
<v Speaker 3>just cuts through the frozen watermelon </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's nothing.</v>

1171
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.170
<v Speaker 3>It's so sobering when you watch a bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>lying on the water,</v>

1172
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in the water,</v>

1173
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:15.490
<v Speaker 3>like lying on its back holding this </v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen watermelon in his paws and just </v>

1174
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:19.520
<v Speaker 3>chomping on it and eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a Disney movie.</v>

1175
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Don't mean when Disney movie bitch by.</v>

1187
00:53:54.311 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] my kids were like,</v>

1188
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 2>why would you kill a bear dad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why would you kill a deer?</v>

1189
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Why would you kill an elk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1190
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 2>to eat it 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.580
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting though,</v>

1192
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.440
<v Speaker 2>help people in my limited super limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience into the hunting world.</v>

1193
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Very entrenched in in it's either no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These animals like these is,</v>

1194
00:54:14.361 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 2>this is Bambi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you do that?</v>

1195
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Or they have an understanding of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1196
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1197
00:54:17.661 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1198
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's a hardcore Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these kind of an asshole about it,</v>

1199
00:54:21.021 --> 00:54:26.021
<v Speaker 3>but he's got dogs and he feeds him dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and dog food from the dog food </v>

1200
00:54:26.021 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 3>store and it's got animals chopped up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground up,</v>

1201
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:31.190
<v Speaker 3>stuffed into these bags and he's good </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that and I'm like,</v>

1202
00:54:31.191 --> 00:54:34.310
<v Speaker 3>you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a fucking hypocrite.</v>

1203
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.600
<v Speaker 3>You really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1204
00:54:35.601 --> 00:54:37.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dogs are carnivores.</v>

1205
00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:38.090
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1206
00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you choose to not be a carnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You choose to be an herbivore.</v>

1207
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most humans are omnivores.</v>

1208
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.340
<v Speaker 3>That was going to say that we evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We evolved to eat a wide variety of </v>

1209
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.900
<v Speaker 3>foods and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that you're doing is just,</v>

1210
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you're standing out and he's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy,</v>

1211
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.050
<v Speaker 3>but he's an asshole and he's always been</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really negative guy,</v>

1212
00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.360
<v Speaker 3>like he's nice to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's.</v>

1213
00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.520
<v Speaker 3>He's nice to his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's always had this propensity for </v>

1214
00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.790
<v Speaker 3>negativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pessimistic attitude towards people be </v>

1215
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:11.111
<v Speaker 3>successful as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but shitty to people like for whatever </v>

1216
00:55:11.111 --> 00:55:14.080
<v Speaker 3>weird reason just has this aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude and now he uses it against,</v>

1217
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.140
<v Speaker 3>against people that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and he gets off on it.</v>

1218
00:55:18.141 --> 00:55:19.730
<v Speaker 3>He thinks it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1219
00:55:19.731 --> 00:55:24.731
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing that you can sort of </v>

1220
00:55:24.731 --> 00:55:25.760
<v Speaker 3>justify the torturing and killing of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals to feed your dogs,</v>

1221
00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:29.600
<v Speaker 3>but when someone wants to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt an animal to eat it,</v>

1222
00:55:29.601 --> 00:55:34.601
<v Speaker 3>like I get all the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed off that people go out and hunt </v>

1223
00:55:34.641 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 3>lions and don't eat 'em and hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants and don't eat them.</v>

1224
00:55:37.841 --> 00:55:40.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm drafts and stuff and I'm with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>

1225
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:45.890
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing that's not eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>

1226
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.100
<v Speaker 3>That's not hunting buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bison and eating bison.</v>

1227
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:52.760
<v Speaker 3>That's not counting and eating things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're talking about.</v>

1228
00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:57.761
<v Speaker 3>Two totally different things and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get to like the lions and the </v>

1229
00:55:57.761 --> 00:56:02.270
<v Speaker 3>elephants and there's a real problem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real problem is that there's not </v>

1230
00:56:02.271 --> 00:56:07.271
<v Speaker 3>enough money in conservation to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 3>the safety of these animals unless these</v>

1231
00:56:08.211 --> 00:56:13.211
<v Speaker 3>animals are valuable and the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable way that you can present these </v>

1232
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:14.480
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucked up,</v>

1233
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:18.200
<v Speaker 3>but when they're hunting targets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not.</v>

1234
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it and I think it's not,</v>

1235
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 3>but Africa is a crazy in the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary about it is Louis Theroux </v>

1236
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:31.680
<v Speaker 3>who's a British documentary and did this</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip where he went to one of those high </v>

1237
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 3>fence hunting camps in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know those things.</v>

1238
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a.</v>

1239
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It was in Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never been around.</v>

1240
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 3>And you weren't hunting people where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was actually.</v>

1241
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 3>They're building schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1242
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.360
<v Speaker 3>let me give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a humanitarian at.</v>

1243
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 3>You're a sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a sweetie,</v>

1244
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 3>but luther rose documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Louis through his documentary is amazing</v>

1245
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.900
<v Speaker 3>because you kind of get the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's all about.</v>

1246
00:56:55.901 --> 00:57:00.901
<v Speaker 3>Like these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them were going extinct just a </v>

1247
00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:03.090
<v Speaker 3>couple of decades ago because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive poverty all throughout Africa </v>

1248
00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 3>and there's no money and they figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out that if you take these animals,</v>

1249
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.920
<v Speaker 3>protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them inside a fenced area in,</v>

1250
00:57:09.921 --> 00:57:12.490
<v Speaker 3>in talking about these enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10,000</v>

1251
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:17.491
<v Speaker 3>Acre reserves preserves and then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly in to hunt them on a daily basis.</v>

1252
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:23.581
<v Speaker 3>They get a tremendous amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then these animals that populations </v>

1253
00:57:23.581 --> 00:57:27.031
<v Speaker 3>are booming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are higher than they've ever been </v>

1254
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 3>and the animals are protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're no longer in any danger of being</v>

1255
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:33.181
<v Speaker 3>extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people are super </v>

1256
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable with the circumstances and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that too.</v>

1257
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the same boat as you would like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

1258
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't like hunting a giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not not into it personally.</v>

1259
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Not going to make a character judgment </v>
<v Speaker 3>against somebody who is or the the </v>

1260
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:47.971
<v Speaker 3>elephant or whatever animal that you may</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to call it trophy hunting.</v>

1261
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:53.251
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume and hope that the </v>

1262
00:57:53.251 --> 00:57:57.851
<v Speaker 3>situation is exactly like you described </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the people who live in the area </v>

1263
00:57:57.851 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 3>are managing and monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The species and making sure it's good to</v>

1264
00:57:58.691 --> 00:58:03.691
<v Speaker 3>go and if they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no issue with it and in the same </v>

1265
00:58:03.691 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 3>breath I totally understand why it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very off putting to individual who see a</v>

1266
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>picture of that and just loses their </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1267
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely get the elephant thing and </v>

1268
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.340
<v Speaker 3>particular elephants to me or this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of majestic sweet animal,</v>

1269
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>but the reality of people living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa is different.</v>

1270
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 3>People that live in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants destroy their crops,</v>

1271
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:26.610
<v Speaker 3>trample them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really becomes a big issue of </v>

1272
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:30.300
<v Speaker 3>elephants move into areas where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming and they have to do something </v>

1273
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:34.651
<v Speaker 3>about it and sometimes they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll have to hire hunters or have </v>

1274
00:58:34.651 --> 00:58:37.381
<v Speaker 3>someone come in and do it and then once </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone does shoot one of those </v>

1275
00:58:37.381 --> 00:58:38.350
<v Speaker 3>elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of people that come in.</v>

1276
00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:43.351
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She posted a picture or you posted a </v>

1277
00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:47.371
<v Speaker 3>picture of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was an elephant and it was a </v>

1278
00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:47.371
<v Speaker 3>line of people outside of the border of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the picture.</v>

1279
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming they were waiting to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get their share of the bank or </v>

1280
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:52.440
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was from that animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard time getting meat.</v>

1282
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.460
<v Speaker 3>An elephant meet is gross as it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people listening to this.</v>

1283
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious if you were raised on it.</v>

1284
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's supposed to taste really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1285
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you go out and get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant burger folks,</v>

1286
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:10.620
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying please don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The soul thing is it's very complicated </v>

1287
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1288
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>these people shouldn't be raising crops </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the elephants live.</v>

1289
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:18.100
<v Speaker 3>The problem is this is not like any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other thing,</v>

1290
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 3>like it's not like an encroachment </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1291
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Like these people are living in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking village in Africa.</v>

1292
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is like literally where </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans evolved.</v>

1293
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:31.720
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a real situation of humans and a</v>

1294
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 3>very small tribal situation encountering</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants that just decide that,</v>

1295
00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:38.090
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an elephant.</v>

1296
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

1297
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to eat your food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

1298
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 3>You Ain't gonna do shit and these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what to do about it.</v>

1299
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing.</v>

1300
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1301
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 3>elephants are going extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes and no.</v>

1302
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 3>In some places in the world you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowa,</v>

1303
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 3>there's no elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1304
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Content as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're extended no elephants.</v>

1305
00:59:56.121 --> 01:00:01.121
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's parts of Africa that have a </v>

1306
01:00:01.121 --> 01:00:03.521
<v Speaker 3>lot of elephants and they actually have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to control the populations and it's the </v>

1307
01:00:03.521 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 3>same thing with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people in California will tell you,</v>

1308
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1309
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't shoot a deer.</v>

1310
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 3>He talked to people in Iowa and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1311
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:12.050
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to shoot these deer.</v>

1312
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:14.660
<v Speaker 3>My wife Rector fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's in the hospital.</v>

1313
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Same thing in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's deer on the side of the road,</v>

1314
01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>

1315
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:22.060
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see for on the bumper,</v>

1316
01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:27.090
<v Speaker 3>bumper is in windshield smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doesn't take a rocket surgeon to </v>

1317
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 3>put two and two to get an advanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1318
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I love how people in Montana have those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking road warrior grills.</v>

1319
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 3>So I got one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got bring it.</v>

1320
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Come on dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently if you hit a deer in Montana,</v>

1321
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 3>you can call the fish and game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them know what happened.</v>

1322
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Throw it in the trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1323
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.980
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good because then you get to keep</v>

1324
01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 3>the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meat doesn't just go to waste.</v>

1325
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.720
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not driving around </v>

1326
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:52.720
<v Speaker 3>looking for a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what someone said,</v>

1327
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.711
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that is the odds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hitting a deer on purpose or like </v>

1328
01:00:56.711 --> 01:00:57.620
<v Speaker 3>fucking zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1329
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you try to avoid them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty high percentage.</v>

1330
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd almost hit a few like I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hit a deer in this truck.</v>

1331
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1332
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.380
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was coming home once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a Gig in upstate New York and I </v>

1333
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.421
<v Speaker 3>was driving down to where I lived in new</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rochelle and I hit this one patch that </v>

1334
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.830
<v Speaker 3>had so many deer.</v>

1335
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I had to drive like 20 miles an hour on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the highway.</v>

1336
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.630
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It probably wouldn't even get out of the</v>

1337
01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:25.631
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just darting in front of the </v>

1338
01:01:25.631 --> 01:01:25.631
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like left and right,</v>

1339
01:01:25.631 --> 01:01:26.630
<v Speaker 3>left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking like an infestation.</v>

1340
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what happens when there's no</v>

1341
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 3>predators and no hunters and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want wolves in your backyard.</v>

1342
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 3>People once you live in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of cool.</v>

1343
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I would still take a strong pass on </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves in the backyard.</v>

1344
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see them.</v>

1345
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:46.040
<v Speaker 3>When I was up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lady who lived up there was talking</v>

1346
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:47.150
<v Speaker 3>to us and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1347
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.240
<v Speaker 3>she lives in this canyon and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves come through a couple of nights </v>

1348
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:52.240
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1349
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 3>what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1350
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:54.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's two things.</v>

1351
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:59.350
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful and you also have to be </v>

1352
01:01:59.350 --> 01:01:59.510
<v Speaker 3>cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

1353
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's this thing where you like,</v>

1354
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there and I loved looking at </v>

1355
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:06.340
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want them to go away.</v>

1356
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I love looking at them from the safety </v>
<v Speaker 3>and security of inside of my house.</v>

1357
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1358
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:14.990
<v Speaker 3>people get a little nervous about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>livestock and definitely their pets.</v>

1359
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I go their pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

1360
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's number one.</v>

1361
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:19.890
<v Speaker 3>They will kill dogs</v>

1362
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

1363
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:23.670
<v Speaker 2>It sounds amazing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hear a pack of wolves in the wild.</v>

1364
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no experience with that.</v>

1365
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:30.681
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never heard an elk bugle until </v>

1366
01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:30.681
<v Speaker 2>September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1367
01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>And I also thought that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I heard them bugling,</v>

1368
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I assumed that they did that all year </v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

1369
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1370
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll communicate by bugling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that for basically a month</v>

1371
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:45.771
<v Speaker 2>you can hear them communicating like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then they zip it and start </v>

1372
01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:47.260
<v Speaker 2>working together as a little probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>not heard.</v>

1373
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was in a valley had when I was in</v>

1374
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:56.901
<v Speaker 2>the middle of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than optimal hunting experience </v>

1375
01:02:56.901 --> 01:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>and just surrounded by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't have had this conversation </v>

1376
01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>at this volume.</v>

1377
01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got to be shitting me.</v>

1378
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a film that's coming out Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Cam went to Utah and we're a </v>

1379
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 3>hunting elk in Utah and there's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene in it where we just every now and </v>

1380
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:17.300
<v Speaker 3>then if you go elk hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially this one place in Utah is</v>

1381
01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.160
<v Speaker 3>enormous ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a private ranch and it's 240,000</v>

1382
01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:26.161
<v Speaker 3>acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were you in relationship to Salt </v>

1383
01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:26.161
<v Speaker 3>Lake City?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couple hours drive.</v>

1384
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jed was driving,</v>

1385
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 3>you don't know southeast West.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I had to do email.</v>

1388
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I was behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1389
01:03:39.071 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1390
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.180
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this one part of the film while </v>

1391
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:45.550
<v Speaker 3>we're in there and you literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might hear 100 bugles around us.</v>

1392
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 3>There's screaming left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1394
01:03:51.841 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 2>the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you were in like an Imax theater</v>

1395
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:56.720
<v Speaker 2>would not do a justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1396
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

1397
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I know,</v>

1398
01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:05.601
<v Speaker 2>I don't have enough of his interactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>around animals to understand behavior </v>

1399
01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:10.070
<v Speaker 2>and patterns and what to expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean in that day was a </v>

1400
01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.820
<v Speaker 2>reinforcement that I was sitting at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaw was on the floor.</v>

1401
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I could not believe what it sounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1402
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:15.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

1403
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.410
<v Speaker 3>like a mystical animal with the sound it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes.</v>

1404
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:23.411
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a lord of the rings </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and when you watch them do it </v>

1405
01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:25.660
<v Speaker 3>to just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we watched this one elk fuck this cow.</v>

1406
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's crazy the way they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they do it as like a brock </v>

1407
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.500
<v Speaker 3>lesnar double leg take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

1408
01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:36.200
<v Speaker 3>he got on top of her from behind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then boom,</v>

1409
01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:41.201
<v Speaker 3>he hits her one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shoves her forward and she </v>

1410
01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:43.130
<v Speaker 3>collapses on her front legs and he kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>wobbles off of her,</v>

1411
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:45.220
<v Speaker 3>but he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a one pump chump.</v>

1412
01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what they're into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're into one bank,</v>

1413
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:52.190
<v Speaker 3>get it done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move on to the next.</v>

1414
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.770
<v Speaker 3>And he's doing it all day long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting month?</v>

1415
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>draining himself.</v>

1416
01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.000
<v Speaker 3>They lose like 30 slash 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1417
01:04:59.001 --> 01:05:00.440
<v Speaker 3>do they really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably more.</v>

1418
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying 30,</v>

1419
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 3>40 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

1420
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

1421
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.680
<v Speaker 3>800 pound animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they lose a lot more than that.</v>

1422
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 3>They get real skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stop eating.</v>

1423
01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:11.030
<v Speaker 3>They just fuck like crazy for two </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1424
01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably the most majestic animal </v>

1425
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 2>that I've ever been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot wait until next September.</v>

1426
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a</v>

1427
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.250
<v Speaker 3>real controversy in Montana about wolves</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the wolves that are in Montana </v>

1428
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:24.850
<v Speaker 3>right now have been reintroduced from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

1429
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:30.300
<v Speaker 3>They captured them from Canada and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroduced them to the yellowstone </v>

1430
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.201
<v Speaker 3>area and there's a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>video about it called the wolves changed</v>

1431
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 3>the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changing rivers.</v>

1432
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a short film,</v>

1433
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:44.430
<v Speaker 3>a short film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called how wolves changed </v>

1434
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:48.571
<v Speaker 3>the river and it all just talks about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how the introduction of the wolves </v>

1435
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:53.880
<v Speaker 3>changed the way the river flowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because is this how wolves change </v>

1436
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:56.470
<v Speaker 3>rivers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1437
01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:01.150
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bad ass because it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows the need for predators.</v>

1438
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.130
<v Speaker 3>It shows that you can't just have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>overabundance of wildlife,</v>

1439
01:06:06.131 --> 01:06:11.131
<v Speaker 3>like a undulates cows and elk and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they eat all the grass when they</v>

1440
01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:16.561
<v Speaker 3>eat all the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trees never grow a strong root </v>

1441
01:06:16.561 --> 01:06:16.561
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of things happen.</v>

1442
01:06:16.561 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Like ECO system on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1443
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 3>and some birds don't survive and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1444
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:26.911
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>songbirds have been spotted in like </v>

1445
01:06:26.911 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 3>really high numbers in yellowstone now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of stuff.</v>

1446
01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:34.951
<v Speaker 3>They documented it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is because the wolves chase </v>

1447
01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:37.930
<v Speaker 3>down the elk and made the elk and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>decimated the elk population,</v>

1448
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:42.931
<v Speaker 3>like knocked it down to like half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the process made those elk like </v>

1449
01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:44.800
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit more wary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little smarter.</v>

1450
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Still a healthy population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's Kinda how it's supposed to </v>

1451
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.461
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to be like these </v>

1452
01:06:53.461 --> 01:06:53.461
<v Speaker 3>hunters that lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got super spoiled because they were</v>

1453
01:06:53.461 --> 01:06:55.820
<v Speaker 3>used to like seeing hundreds of hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bed,</v>

1454
01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 3>like slide open the door and get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>laser range finder out.</v>

1455
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're a rifle hunter,</v>

1456
01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's way more rifle hunter.</v>

1457
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I can't get behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get behind me.</v>

1458
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

1459
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't need meat.</v>

1460
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the way you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1461
01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself personally,</v>

1462
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 2>it has no draw or interest whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1463
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Bow Hunting on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're now we're talking.</v>

1464
01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:27.420
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One I absolutely suck at and the other </v>

1465
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1466
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.870
<v Speaker 2>generally can hit what I'm aiming at and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier with the rifle.</v>

1467
01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Like wind is the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a shot with a rifle in high </v>

1468
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.831
<v Speaker 2>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wind when you're thinking of rifle </v>

1469
01:07:40.831 --> 01:07:40.831
<v Speaker 2>is from the ballistic effect of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1470
01:07:40.831 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left or right or in the temperature and </v>

1471
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When with a bow,</v>

1472
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:49.800
<v Speaker 2>your crawl on your belly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being a Ninja and then it's like </v>

1473
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.940
<v Speaker 2>animals gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a completely different ball game.</v>

1474
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:58.320
<v Speaker 2>You could sit with a rifle with a cooler</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bowl of Chili and get an elk.</v>

1475
01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the other thing that gets me </v>

1476
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:05.180
<v Speaker 3>with rifles and I don't think you should</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it any more difficult.</v>

1477
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the most effective and efficient</v>

1478
01:08:10.581 --> 01:08:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and ethical way you should kill an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal should be the way you do it.</v>

1479
01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>But there's these pods that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these that they set</v>

1480
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 1>up a tripod with a bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially God like a mobile rifle</v>

1481
01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>bench sitting there on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a you lena,</v>

1482
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:30.821
<v Speaker 1>like a lead sled attached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just bring your finger in from </v>

1483
01:08:30.821 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the outside and just bring it back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't move at all.</v>

1484
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to have it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>

1485
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.900
<v Speaker 1>You lock it in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you screw it down so you have the </v>

1486
01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>perfect angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set it on the vitals and you squeeze</v>

1487
01:08:38.661 --> 01:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it off and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and exactly where you want it.</v>

1488
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>In that setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could actually not even have it </v>

1489
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.881
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go sit in a chair to the side </v>

1490
01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>of it and people do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be clear,</v>

1491
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I support hunting whether you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you want to do it.</v>

1492
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm a full fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me personally,</v>

1493
01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I just can't get into rifle hunting gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>too easy.</v>

1494
01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 1>If you put an elk anywhere from zero to </v>
<v Speaker 1>1500 yards in front of me,</v>

1495
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 1>it's game over Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1496
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an expert marksman though.</v>

1497
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm a marksman.</v>

1498
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would add expert to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1499
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but I can sometimes hit things humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed.</v>

1500
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:17.141
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I guess I'm good Miss Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see an animal and you're </v>

1501
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:22.991
<v Speaker 1>hunting with a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the thing is the difficulty and the </v>

1502
01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:27.311
<v Speaker 1>challenge and the connection to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals way more intense because you're </v>

1503
01:09:27.311 --> 01:09:30.641
<v Speaker 1>trying to get inside a 40 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing to me is it's not a </v>

1504
01:09:30.641 --> 01:09:32.150
<v Speaker 1>matter of how much I feel like I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1505
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:37.151
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of how few things I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess up and I love fighting against the </v>

1506
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:42.851
<v Speaker 1>odds like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the challenge of having to worry </v>

1507
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:44.920
<v Speaker 1>about not only cover and concealment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1508
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:50.050
<v Speaker 1>high ground versus low ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shadows and light and moving and </v>

1509
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:54.131
<v Speaker 1>noise inside of that moving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring the wind and then the fact </v>

1510
01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that the animal might just want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a piss and you're screwed.</v>

1511
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>You get the best stock in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

1512
01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a Wiz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

1513
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I love the challenge of it and I suck at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1514
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1515
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it is a draw to me that and my wife has </v>
<v Speaker 1>already shaking her head at me.</v>

1516
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

1517
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going hunting again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people they're.</v>

1519
01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:17.801
<v Speaker 1>The issue that they have is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that killing an animal should not </v>

1520
01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>be this pleasurable challenge that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

1521
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:25.181
<v Speaker 1>If you are going to eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be shooting him in the head </v>

1522
01:10:25.181 --> 01:10:28.720
<v Speaker 1>with a high powered rifle where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't miss and they die instantaneously </v>

1523
01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's no suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only that situation actually existed.</v>

1524
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Well it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you shoot them from five yards,</v>

1525
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:39.550
<v Speaker 1>well you know you missed some big </v>
<v Speaker 1>targets with a rifle from pretty damn </v>

1526
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.550
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

1527
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>How close?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven feet.</v>

1528
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're running it through a hallway</v>

1529
01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's a different animal.</v>

1530
01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a different animal both </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuratively and literally.</v>

1531
01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I missed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1532
01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:54.110
<v Speaker 1>if there is no 100 percent solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1533
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if an animal doesn't know you're </v>

1534
01:10:59.140 --> 01:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>there and you're setting up and it's 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard shot and you have a 30 year,</v>

1535
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you've done 300 win mag or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even need to get to 100 yards.</v>

1536
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be at 300 or $500.</v>

1537
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel comfortable shooting at a.</v>

1538
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>If you want meat though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1539
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also why not</v>

1540
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:19.100
<v Speaker 2>enjoy the experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1541
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.351
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it's a challenge in more than a </v>

1542
01:11:21.351 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 2>challenge in of whatever it sounds gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a journey.</v>

1543
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy Sanga.</v>

1544
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just journeys.</v>

1545
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

1546
01:11:26.701 --> 01:11:31.701
<v Speaker 2>I guess on the type of journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about the Lord of the </v>

1547
01:11:31.701 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>rings was a journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a journey.</v>

1548
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I've watched all those movies about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

1549
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read the books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to New Zealand and jump off</v>

1550
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>the cliffs in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1551
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey is like why not enjoy it?</v>

1552
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy the struggle.</v>

1553
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to hit what you're aiming at </v>

1554
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.741
<v Speaker 2>with a bow and exponentially more so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that every time you add a yard to the </v>

1555
01:11:54.741 --> 01:11:57.360
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy that the animals are,</v>

1556
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.540
<v Speaker 2>they have instincts that are amazing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you cannot defeat their nose and </v>

1557
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 2>that you can't control the and joy all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1558
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.900
<v Speaker 2>That to me is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm enjoying that experience.</v>

1559
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 2>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my first bow hunting season.</v>

1560
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:17.121
<v Speaker 2>I started bowhunting and late August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have almost no experience under my </v>

1561
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:18.040
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do enjoy the,</v>

1562
01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:23.100
<v Speaker 2>the final aspect of that as well too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in getting into position and being able </v>

1563
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.540
<v Speaker 2>to perform in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1564
01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 2>with enjoying killing an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing so respectfully and like my</v>

1565
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 2>freezer right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my house,</v>

1566
01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:34.971
<v Speaker 2>my goal is to never go to the grocery </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and buy meat again for the entire </v>

1567
01:12:34.971 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 2>year and I think our freezer is full </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to do that.</v>

1568
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 2>My kids love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made.</v>

1569
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I got maple elk sausage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got Italian elk sausage.</v>

1570
01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I got brought worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get steaks.</v>

1571
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:45.120
<v Speaker 2>I got roast like we're not going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store.</v>

1572
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me like so why not enjoy that </v>

1573
01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:52.521
<v Speaker 2>whole process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole story arc doing it ethically </v>

1574
01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:52.740
<v Speaker 2>and enjoying the journey along.</v>

1575
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1576
01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:58.031
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just wanted to hear you spell it </v>

1577
01:12:58.031 --> 01:13:00.660
<v Speaker 2>out because that's the issue that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that are sort of in the animal</v>

1578
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:05.661
<v Speaker 2>rights activist side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that they would have </v>

1579
01:13:05.661 --> 01:13:05.661
<v Speaker 2>an issue with is the enjoyment part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1580
01:13:05.661 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 2>but I can't help it if some people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussies.</v>

1581
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just the challenge of like doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are hard is enjoyable and </v>

1582
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and succeeding at things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to do.</v>

1583
01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:19.930
<v Speaker 2>It was also enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you be happy about winning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you be happy about accepting a</v>

1585
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:27.600
<v Speaker 2>challenge willingly and nobody's forcing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you into it and when you're successful,</v>

1586
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you're not only happy with that success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're happy with every step along </v>

1587
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:32.960
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any problem with that.</v>

1588
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're Bernie Sanders </v>

1589
01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:37.730
<v Speaker 2>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not qualified to talk on that topic.</v>

1590
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.360
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking with you right up </v>
<v Speaker 2>until that point.</v>

1591
01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love Bernie relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joking around here folks.</v>

1592
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1593
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1594
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1595
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:54.951
<v Speaker 2>if someone doesn't want a Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to take prolong trips to the </v>

1596
01:13:54.951 --> 01:13:55.110
<v Speaker 2>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fucking great for you.</v>

1597
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I think I started doing it in 2012 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>has changed my life.</v>

1598
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I whole heartedly agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dead serious when I say I don't </v>

1599
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 2>think he figured out who you are until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get into those environments.</v>

1600
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I have taken a sounding on the depth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I am as a human being in the worst,</v>

1601
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>most</v>

1602
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>physically arduous moments of my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1603
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and I wish that more people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingly go to that point.</v>

1604
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes my perspective for sure.</v>

1605
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It changes my appreciation for things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing will make you appreciate the </v>

1606
01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:31.110
<v Speaker 1>little things in your life more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly dying and having,</v>

1607
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1608
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:37.170
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have all of these things that I </v>

1609
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:37.170
<v Speaker 1>wasn't paying attention to and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that.</v>

1610
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>People who didn't listen to your earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts don't know your story.</v>

1611
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>So tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people what happened when he almost</v>

1612
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:46.351
<v Speaker 1>died on the jumping side of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the military first and then </v>

1613
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to the jumping side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1614
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it seems like to me like</v>

1615
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you might be supplementing your need for</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger with this jumping thing.</v>

1616
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Talk about how you described me as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>

1617
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Every time you have this fucking Grazie </v>
<v Speaker 1>nude,</v>

1618
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy person that I know.</v>

1619
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Then I texted you that once and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>responded that crazier than,</v>

1620
01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I think on the.</v>

1621
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1622
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>

1623
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.080
<v Speaker 1>well for one you willingly used to enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>into fights and you have said before </v>

1624
01:15:16.241 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 1>that you would have gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon and earlier age.</v>

1625
01:15:18.461 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 1>To me that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1626
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going in there and did willingly go</v>

1627
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 1>in and just getting into a fistfight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody.</v>

1628
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>How much martial arts experience do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

1629
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

1630
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's martial arts a lot.</v>

1631
01:15:30.911 --> 01:15:35.911
<v Speaker 1>Like bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you got into base jumping </v>

1632
01:15:35.911 --> 01:15:35.911
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have fucking zero.</v>

1633
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You're making my point zero on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ledger.</v>

1634
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That suit got.</v>

1635
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks weird.</v>

1636
01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Fish islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Thailand's.</v>

1637
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>What I've been able to determine from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping is that yes,</v>

1638
01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.160
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is round.</v>

1639
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You sought from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell me.</v>

1640
01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Sure when I jumped from pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something you little curve.</v>

1641
01:15:58.631 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that someone pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that's a really good point on,</v>

1642
01:16:01.721 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reiterate it.</v>

1643
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at the moon with the </v>

1644
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.981
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to go to the same place </v>

1645
01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:10.981
<v Speaker 1>because I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1646
01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:10.981
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right folks.</v>

1647
01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to look and find Mount Everest with </v>

1648
01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:18.400
<v Speaker 1>a telescope and then explain why you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

1649
01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:21.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't because it's on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fucking planet.</v>

1650
01:16:21.531 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 1>You dummies crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so sad to me.</v>

1651
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love mysteries though.</v>

1652
01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:30.820
<v Speaker 1>They love things that are hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden,</v>

1653
01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.200
<v Speaker 1>hidden information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1654
01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:36.730
<v Speaker 1>that's why the seal books right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You answered why people will buy because</v>

1655
01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:38.620
<v Speaker 1>of that symbol they look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1656
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know the secret.</v>

1657
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's.</v>

1658
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is no secret.</v>

1659
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point I can get.</v>

1660
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to that definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

1661
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:52.410
<v Speaker 1>How did almost martial art thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the martial art thing I think is a </v>

1662
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 1>lot like the bow hunting thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1663
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:58.000
<v Speaker 1>very difficult and once you start doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it you get better at it and then you get</v>

1664
01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:03.001
<v Speaker 1>addicted to it and it's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like I'm not even talking about </v>

1665
01:17:03.001 --> 01:17:06.061
<v Speaker 1>like actual competing and fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just training because when you're </v>

1666
01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:07.480
<v Speaker 1>training you're competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you go onto the mat,</v>

1667
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>you train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to improve yourself,</v>

1668
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>but you're also</v>

1669
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.520
<v Speaker 3>trying to tap someone who's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tap you and you go,</v>

1670
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you're both going at it and when you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and you get better at it and you get </v>

1671
01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.221
<v Speaker 3>better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop this kind of understanding </v>

1672
01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 3>of what it is and it becomes this like </v>
<v Speaker 3>very addictive thing.</v>

1673
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Like guys are addicted hard to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1674
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.400
<v Speaker 3>is it possible to master or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>never ending evolution?</v>

1675
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be a master in comparison to </v>

1676
01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:33.490
<v Speaker 3>someone who doesn't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

1677
01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll definitely.</v>

1678
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only problem is your body starts to </v>

1679
01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 3>break down as you get into your older </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages.</v>

1680
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:45.191
<v Speaker 3>Like most guys that I know that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their forties and for sure in their </v>

1681
01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:48.701
<v Speaker 3>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was in Hawaii recently with Ed </v>

1682
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.850
<v Speaker 3>O'neil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

1683
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:56.600
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't know big Ed </v>
<v Speaker 3>O'neill from married with children and a</v>

1684
01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:57.620
<v Speaker 3>modern family.</v>

1685
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a beast.</v>

1686
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1687
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Legit black belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under the gracies.</v>

1688
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would have never guessed that.</v>

1689
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:11.530
<v Speaker 3>We'd never done so many fucks with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting thrown in their head and </v>

1690
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:11.750
<v Speaker 3>choked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was telling me this.</v>

1691
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.780
<v Speaker 3>He was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is right there at o'neill black belt </v>

1692
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.660
<v Speaker 3>training with Horian Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That what's the average journey to a </v>

1693
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.711
<v Speaker 3>black belt years was I'd say 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten is average and that's grinding like </v>

1694
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 3>getting after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Thursday.</v>

1695
01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Every other week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 3>But some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people get there quicker than 10.</v>

1697
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bj Penn got his three.</v>

1698
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:36.320
<v Speaker 3>I was a brown belt for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight years of brown belt.</v>

1699
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I like your stone job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fuming.</v>

1700
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I can train together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's train him like twice a week and </v>

1701
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to have a career,</v>

1702
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.740
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1703
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 3>for the people that really get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really get obsessed with it.</v>

1704
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 3>It becomes just as addictive as archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

1705
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1706
01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I and I think what we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier when we were talking about </v>

1707
01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.891
<v Speaker 3>people being angry and like on social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media because they're not getting those </v>

1708
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:09.161
<v Speaker 3>natural rewards and the natural struggle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life and their life is very muted in </v>

1709
01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 3>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No struggle or no struggle.</v>

1710
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is so appealing to people and </v>

1711
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.600
<v Speaker 3>even though you get injured in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of the injuries like a tweak my</v>

1712
01:19:17.601 --> 01:19:20.540
<v Speaker 3>back or I fucked up my elbow or my knee </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets screwed up.</v>

1713
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not like brain injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brain injuries were the ones that </v>

1714
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:25.870
<v Speaker 3>were the most disturbing to me because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1715
01:19:25.871 --> 01:19:29.540
<v Speaker 3>I was recognizing at like 21 that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>having some issues.</v>

1716
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:31.190
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about this recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

1717
01:19:31.191 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 3>the headaches laying in bed.</v>

1718
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I have and I know a lot of guys from </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous career who are suffering from </v>

1719
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:43.150
<v Speaker 3>we're discovering or the military is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing research into the causes of the </v>

1720
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.550
<v Speaker 3>brain injury issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1721
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:51.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not awesome to read your future </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get diagnosed with that and </v>

1722
01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:51.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1723
01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:54.340
<v Speaker 3>so what does it look like when I'm 60?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like when I'm 78,</v>

1724
01:19:54.341 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 3>late?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good at all.</v>

1725
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Those aren't good Tarot cards to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My good friend Dr.</v>

1726
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is an expert in traumatic brain </v>

1727
01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>injury and does a lot of work with </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers and uh,</v>

1728
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Morris Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he</v>

1729
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.580
<v Speaker 1>has a warrior Angel Foundation and Dr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon does a lot of work with him and </v>

1730
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:18.531
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have developed some really good </v>

1731
01:20:18.531 --> 01:20:21.921
<v Speaker 1>protocols for helping guys and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped a shit ton of guys and he does a </v>

1732
01:20:21.921 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>lot of the work for like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to help as many people as he</v>

1733
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 1>can because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1734
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing well financially,</v>

1735
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

1736
01:20:30.181 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 1>he's not desperate for money to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of charity works.</v>

1737
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:38.061
<v Speaker 1>My point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dedicated a significant amount of </v>

1738
01:20:38.061 --> 01:20:41.700
<v Speaker 1>his professional time to try to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions for soldiers.</v>

1739
01:20:41.701 --> 01:20:46.701
<v Speaker 1>And also he's done a lot of work with </v>
<v Speaker 1>football players and boxers and </v>

1740
01:20:46.701 --> 01:20:47.960
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's going to get that enclosed</v>

1741
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:52.970
<v Speaker 1>brain trauma it at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think on the chart it ends up looking </v>

1742
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how he necessarily got</v>

1743
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:58.401
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is in involved in some new </v>

1744
01:20:58.401 --> 01:20:58.401
<v Speaker 1>protocols now too.</v>

1745
01:20:58.401 --> 01:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've developed some stuff in San </v>

1746
01:21:02.050 --> 01:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1747
01:21:02.050 --> 01:21:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A medical institution that's doing it,</v>

1748
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:09.890
<v Speaker 1>but they've got something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dealing with some sort of </v>

1749
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>electro magnetic therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnetic resonation with touch.</v>

1750
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I have heard there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may well be the same clinic.</v>

1751
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of buddies that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>who came to San Diego,</v>

1752
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:24.020
<v Speaker 1>La Jolla area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go in once a day or twice a </v>

1753
01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.291
<v Speaker 1>day for a quick session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was magnets placed </v>

1754
01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:27.291
<v Speaker 1>either across from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1755
01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:31.881
<v Speaker 1>It was a protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was for a month and to a </v>

1756
01:21:31.881 --> 01:21:35.961
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all actually said that they had a </v>

1757
01:21:35.961 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 1>significant benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that be.</v>

1758
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were saying they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping better and I don't know the </v>

1759
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 1>causality or correlation there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had improvement.</v>

1760
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It could have been their mood function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>

1761
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but so how did the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they think about if you get </v>

1762
01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.770
<v Speaker 1>knocked out in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're just flatlined,</v>

1763
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 1>do you have a minimum amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can back?</v>

1764
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I think most of the time they give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>a 90 day suspension,</v>

1765
01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 1>which in my opinion is way too short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to.</v>

1766
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all they say like 90 </v>

1767
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no contact,</v>

1768
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but those guys are going to be sparring </v>
<v Speaker 1>before then.</v>

1769
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 1>That is the issue that I've heard with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the active duty guys now.</v>

1770
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:16.131
<v Speaker 1>They'll go in and from a perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they kind of want to preempt and </v>

1771
01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 1>get an idea of where their head is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently.</v>

1772
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 1>They'll go in and they'll get a scan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>however they.</v>

1773
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.790
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't give me the scans because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have retained metal in my body,</v>

1774
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of it is based off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mris and the magnets and stuff and </v>

1775
01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.590
<v Speaker 1>they'll recognize that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursors or they'll.</v>

1776
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.420
<v Speaker 1>They'll have damage to their head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys,</v>

1777
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to take any time off.</v>

1778
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.960
<v Speaker 1>They went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to get back into it.</v>

1779
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1780
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1781
01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:41.970
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1782
01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 1>this is could be what it could look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in the coming years.</v>

1783
01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1784
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put me back in coach.</v>

1785
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a struggle to get them to take time</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1786
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 1>which that doesn't surprise me that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC guys were the same way.</v>

1787
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:53.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1788
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely the way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially the real savages.</v>

1789
01:22:56.131 --> 01:22:58.410
<v Speaker 1>The ones where the winners like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisping,</v>

1790
01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost the George St Pierre and then </v>

1791
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:06.411
<v Speaker 1>three weeks later fought against Calvin </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline and got stopped and a lot of </v>

1792
01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:06.411
<v Speaker 1>people criticize</v>

1793
01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:07.000
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me included,</v>

1794
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.300
<v Speaker 3>and they shouldn't let them in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1795
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.700
<v Speaker 3>He needs time to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got battered in that fight,</v>

1796
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 3>got choked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got them fighting again </v>

1797
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 3>three weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not smart,</v>

1798
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 3>but he</v>

1799
01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:21.290
<v Speaker 2>probably a not knowing a thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fought tooth and nail to get into that </v>

1800
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:25.671
<v Speaker 2>ring with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess 102 weeks later it's a fucking </v>

1801
01:23:25.671 --> 01:23:29.481
<v Speaker 2>animal until you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you're done 60 and then you're </v>

1802
01:23:29.481 --> 01:23:30.450
<v Speaker 2>drooling on yourself and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking or the Easter bunny.</v>

1803
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1804
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:32.430
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good look.</v>

1805
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:34.320
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's possible.</v>

1806
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1807
01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to almost protect people from </v>

1808
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:43.191
<v Speaker 3>themselves or may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There could be an argument that there </v>

1809
01:23:43.191 --> 01:23:47.961
<v Speaker 3>should be sort of a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>education for fighters at least because </v>

1810
01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 3>this is an elective thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1811
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.660
<v Speaker 3>And which you're definitely going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit for soldiers.</v>

1812
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:58.530
<v Speaker 3>My good argument as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there should be some sort of </v>

1813
01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.700
<v Speaker 3>elective or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1814
01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:03.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of an education thing.</v>

1815
01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:08.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the word I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least at least educate to the,</v>

1816
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:13.760
<v Speaker 2>just go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into whatever situation you're going </v>

1817
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.951
<v Speaker 2>to go into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the UFC or the nfl or the </v>

1818
01:24:15.951 --> 01:24:18.320
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it just go in with an educated </v>

1819
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:18.320
<v Speaker 2>perspective instead of going in blank </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1820
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of it not understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're at and why it happened.</v>

1821
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.060
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think it is that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to jump out of planes?</v>

1822
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1823
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put a squirrel suit on a.</v>

1824
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.550
<v Speaker 3>do you think this is what I asked you </v>
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>

1825
01:24:33.551 --> 01:24:38.551
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that this is like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfilling some sort of a desire for </v>

1826
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:42.270
<v Speaker 3>excitement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some.</v>

1827
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Some need for extreme situations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1828
01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:48.640
<v Speaker 3>so skydiving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping out of an airplane,</v>

1829
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.090
<v Speaker 3>is it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1830
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:57.230
<v Speaker 2>if you follow some very basic principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being current and maintaining your </v>

1831
01:24:57.230 --> 01:25:00.300
<v Speaker 2>gear and taking your time to pack your </v>
<v Speaker 2>parachute the most difficult or not most</v>

1832
01:25:00.301 --> 01:25:05.301
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most dangerous portion of a day </v>

1833
01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 2>skydiving will be your drive to the drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone and your drive home from,</v>

1834
01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:11.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to those people that fuck </v>

1835
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:11.341
<v Speaker 2>up and die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1836
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:11.341
<v Speaker 2>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a separate two categories.</v>

1837
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:16.071
<v Speaker 2>There's jumping out of an airplane with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a parachute and a reserve parachute and </v>

1838
01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:20.841
<v Speaker 2>a lot of altitude and a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's base jumping which is </v>

1839
01:25:20.841 --> 01:25:24.681
<v Speaker 2>off of a static object with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>parachute generally closer to the </v>

1840
01:25:24.681 --> 01:25:25.980
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that lack of altitude and separation</v>

1841
01:25:25.981 --> 01:25:28.410
<v Speaker 2>from the ground gives you less time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less options.</v>

1842
01:25:28.411 --> 01:25:31.920
<v Speaker 2>You got to be really tight on your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a game in both of those worlds.</v>

1843
01:25:31.921 --> 01:25:35.760
<v Speaker 2>What I think in my opinion is that kills</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most people is complacency.</v>

1844
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:41.270
<v Speaker 2>There has not been a gear related </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatality is far back as I can really </v>

1845
01:25:41.611 --> 01:25:43.890
<v Speaker 2>find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the last 10 to 15 years.</v>

1846
01:25:43.891 --> 01:25:46.290
<v Speaker 2>It's people killing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the gear killing them.</v>

1847
01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:47.640
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1848
01:25:47.641 --> 01:25:49.600
<v Speaker 2>How did they kill themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1849
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.820
<v Speaker 2>getting in over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting a maneuver that you have no </v>

1850
01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.820
<v Speaker 2>ability to recover from if it were to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

1851
01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the skydiving world.</v>

1852
01:25:58.201 --> 01:26:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So to use the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wingsuit as an example,</v>

1853
01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if you keep the suit flying straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels incredibly stable.</v>

1854
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>It feels like you're laying in an air </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress.</v>

1855
01:26:07.611 --> 01:26:12.611
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard at all that you literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the aircraft and you spread </v>

1856
01:26:12.611 --> 01:26:15.671
<v Speaker 2>your arms and legs out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Ram air inlets that inflate the </v>

1857
01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.731
<v Speaker 2>suit and you can lay on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can literally just relax and lay in </v>

1858
01:26:18.731 --> 01:26:21.311
<v Speaker 2>the suit and you'd fly at 60 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your performance to make up a number </v>

1859
01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>that's probably somewhat accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you know,</v>

1860
01:26:24.141 --> 01:26:26.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want a flat on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Jesus.</v>

1861
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe you want to fly next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1862
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe you want to do an intricate </v>
<v Speaker 2>formation that's both vertically and </v>

1863
01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:36.360
<v Speaker 2>horizontally separated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of people colliding while Sky</v>

1864
01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Dot yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has catastrophic results.</v>

1865
01:26:38.521 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Louise get ripped off a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1866
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:45.671
<v Speaker 2>There was a pair of Golden Knights that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide to capitate and it didn't </v>

1867
01:26:45.671 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 2>decapitate the guy from the pelvis down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut off both legs,</v>

1868
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can get yourself going 100 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour forward speed.</v>

1869
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:51.870
<v Speaker 2>So you got off both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1870
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>What hit his head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit his shoulder head is a,</v>

1871
01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I believe the lower portion of his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened to the guys shoulder?</v>

1872
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.230
<v Speaker 2>He had a vacation in the hospital for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and the other guy died.</v>

1873
01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually knew what I think.</v>

1874
01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the dude with no legs,</v>

1875
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I think the dude with no legs is the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>who lived because he jumped again.</v>

1876
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.070
<v Speaker 2>The guy who hit him is the one that </v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

1877
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

1878
01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it's jumped again after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 2>nearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1880
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he did.</v>

1881
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:28.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you text me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you do this shit and France into </v>

1882
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the planet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1883
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 2>don't ask me rhetorical questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

1884
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Ask you a guy was trying to get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

1885
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:33.350
<v Speaker 2>He was doing the squirrel suit into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>

1886
01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>but he missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bounced off the plane and it didn't </v>

1888
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.711
<v Speaker 2>look good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a the same red bull dudes </v>

1889
01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:44.300
<v Speaker 2>and that is probably the worst situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get into because you could see</v>

1890
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:47.990
<v Speaker 2>he was spinning in the suit and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you can kill yourself in a wing suit</v>

1891
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 2>if you try some crazy maneuver that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not capable of doing,</v>

1892
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:57.090
<v Speaker 2>essentially stole the suit and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up on your back spinning out of </v>

1893
01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:57.090
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1894
01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 2>You'll black out in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to that guy that bounced </v>

1896
01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:03.940
<v Speaker 2>off the plane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled it out.</v>

1897
01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

1898
01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Because you know later on that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1899
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those.</v>

1900
01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 2>So that guy that is fred invents their </v>
<v Speaker 2>red bull dudes,</v>

1901
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:14.910
<v Speaker 2>they are at the absolute apex of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and yeah,</v>

1902
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean he hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was able to recover because later in </v>

1903
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.350
<v Speaker 2>that video they were both able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully get in,</v>

1904
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:25.301
<v Speaker 2>but that guy has been jumping for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades in tens of thousands of jumps.</v>

1905
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>So of course he can recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got 10 jumps,</v>

1906
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is people see that video</v>

1907
01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing on Thursday,</v>

1908
01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:39.050
<v Speaker 2>and he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do stupid shit and they're not.</v>

1909
01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:44.080
<v Speaker 2>They're not aware of their ability or </v>
<v Speaker 2>their skill or they're just not looking </v>

1910
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>in the mirror and being honest with </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1911
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They attempt something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most common in skydiving thing is </v>

1912
01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:51.290
<v Speaker 2>somebody to die under perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning equipment.</v>

1913
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:56.640
<v Speaker 2>They'll have a really small main canopy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most main canopy.</v>

1914
01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:01.641
<v Speaker 2>The canopy or suspended under in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>harness when you're learning is about </v>

1915
01:29:01.641 --> 01:29:03.450
<v Speaker 2>300 to 360 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like driving a school bus.</v>

1916
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 2>It really slow turns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't dive,</v>

1917
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.600
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people try to get to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little postage stamp parachutes.</v>

1918
01:29:11.611 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 2>There are 71 square feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 square feet,</v>

1919
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>and in those canopies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you initiate a turn,</v>

1920
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what you do after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>

1921
01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you cannot pull the canopy out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dive until it goes through its natural </v>

1922
01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.601
<v Speaker 2>recovery arc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you initiate that turn 300 feet </v>

1923
01:29:29.601 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

1924
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 2>You'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be lucky to walk away with a set </v>

1925
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.301
<v Speaker 2>of powdered femurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exciting to watch from the </v>

1926
01:29:38.301 --> 01:29:40.761
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting noise to hear </v>

1927
01:29:40.761 --> 01:29:40.761
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1928
01:29:40.761 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>That's best case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle of the ground would be wheelchair</v>

1929
01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:44.340
<v Speaker 2>with a colostomy bag for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

1930
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:49.341
<v Speaker 2>Worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting carted off in an </v>

1931
01:29:49.341 --> 01:29:50.670
<v Speaker 2>ambulance and you're dead and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a rush to get to that super small canopy</v>

1932
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:54.510
<v Speaker 2>or you just started jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is like a status thing.</v>

1933
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Guys want to show you that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping on the super small up.</v>

1934
01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You ever see people in the mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts world who just started and they </v>

1935
01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:02.980
<v Speaker 2>think they're ready for the cage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1936
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It's the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you would happens in Motorcross as</v>

1937
01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:09.720
<v Speaker 2>surfing guy learns to serve as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>north shore.</v>

1938
01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's go like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

1939
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:16.251
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're using a foam surfboard that's 12 </v>

1940
01:30:16.251 --> 01:30:16.251
<v Speaker 2>feet long to go to the north shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to die,</v>

1941
01:30:16.251 --> 01:30:18.720
<v Speaker 2>but nothing you say to them easier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use a foam on this 12 feet long.</v>

1942
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it came from that </v>

1943
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.810
<v Speaker 2>from probably on a smaller way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should get a foam surfboard,</v>

1944
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:26.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think I think either way though on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the north shore they're going to die,</v>

1945
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 2>but to you try to tell that to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1946
01:30:28.711 --> 01:30:31.130
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're ready and not only that,</v>

1947
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:36.140
<v Speaker 2>they're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to go to best buy and get about </v>

1948
01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.241
<v Speaker 2>four Gopros and then we're going to send</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing and you're dead and it </v>

1949
01:30:38.241 --> 01:30:41.130
<v Speaker 2>presents this and it creates this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>

1950
01:30:41.150 --> 01:30:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to talk about the risk </v>

1951
01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:46.150
<v Speaker 2>necessarily because there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

1952
01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:50.571
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a community of people that really </v>

1953
01:30:50.571 --> 01:30:53.151
<v Speaker 2>romanticize that risk and they define </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves by that risk or that's not </v>

1954
01:30:53.151 --> 01:30:53.370
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I'm looking for at all.</v>

1955
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.710
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to skydiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fun,</v>

1956
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:56.040
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1957
01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I cannot not smile when I'm flying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wingsuit.</v>

1958
01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You're doing 120 miles an hour forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>face first.</v>

1959
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:05.280
<v Speaker 2>They've got a bug in the mug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1960
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:10.281
<v Speaker 2>You'll come down to speckled all sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've almost hit a bird base jumping in </v>

1961
01:31:10.281 --> 01:31:10.281
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just,</v>

1962
01:31:10.281 --> 01:31:10.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1963
01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:15.770
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between skydiving </v>

1964
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.661
<v Speaker 2>and base jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skydiving is if you have enough </v>

1965
01:31:17.661 --> 01:31:20.781
<v Speaker 2>experience and you learned that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle with most likely what's going to </v>

1966
01:31:20.781 --> 01:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just focus on having fun.</v>

1967
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Base jumping is a different activity for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1968
01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different sport,</v>

1969
01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 2>different act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even call it a sport.</v>

1970
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:34.071
<v Speaker 2>It's an activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many guys have you seen die base </v>

1971
01:31:34.071 --> 01:31:37.881
<v Speaker 2>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skydiving in a squirrel suit?</v>

1972
01:31:37.981 --> 01:31:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that many.</v>

1973
01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I have seen more people die under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>super small canopies turning to low and </v>

1974
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.180
<v Speaker 2>just impacting the ground.</v>

1975
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sight to be seen where the </v>

1976
01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 2>candidates in such a steep dive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as you're the canopies up top,</v>

1977
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:56.250
<v Speaker 2>as your pitch over your body is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>above the canopy,</v>

1978
01:31:56.251 --> 01:31:58.530
<v Speaker 2>so it hits and they them into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

1979
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a wet,</v>

1980
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>wet meat on concrete it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1981
01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can hear it coming because the </v>

1982
01:32:08.701 --> 01:32:10.501
<v Speaker 2>canopy is whistle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lines that suspend you underneath </v>

1983
01:32:10.501 --> 01:32:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the canopy that are cutting through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>air and you just hear it.</v>

1984
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:14.630
<v Speaker 2>You look up and then Wham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1985
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:19.860
<v Speaker 2>as far as actually physically watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go in May too,</v>

1986
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1987
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 2>my last trip to Switzerland in 2016 last</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

1988
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the valley with my buddy Alex and we </v>

1989
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 2>were there for two weeks and 15 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when in 15.</v>

1990
01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now how many people were there that it's</v>

1991
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:36.190
<v Speaker 2>hard to say.</v>

1992
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1993
01:32:37.241 --> 01:32:42.241
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to be careful talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the stats and the risk because I </v>

1994
01:32:42.241 --> 01:32:43.630
<v Speaker 2>don't really know how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>partake in that activity,</v>

1995
01:32:43.631 --> 01:32:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those 15,</v>

1996
01:32:45.281 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gear related,</v>

1997
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 2>not a single one was because their gear </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>

1998
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:55.650
<v Speaker 2>It was in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody attempting or just living there</v>

1999
01:32:55.660 --> 01:33:00.660
<v Speaker 2>or walking on a razor blade and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when I go over there I'll I </v>

2000
01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:02.770
<v Speaker 2>will do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fly close to the ground or I'll fly</v>

2001
01:33:02.771 --> 01:33:07.771
<v Speaker 2>in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trees were all fly through a crack and </v>

2002
01:33:07.771 --> 01:33:07.771
<v Speaker 2>mess around with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2003
01:33:07.771 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I try to do it on a very limited time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2004
01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:14.761
<v Speaker 2>I try to have outs and I try to work my </v>
<v Speaker 2>way into that position and what I have </v>

2005
01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:15.700
<v Speaker 2>seen personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't mean that this.</v>

2006
01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 2>This is the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I have personally seen with my own </v>

2007
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:23.161
<v Speaker 2>eyes is people that don't take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>route and they want to go straight to </v>

2008
01:33:23.161 --> 01:33:23.161
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2009
01:33:23.161 --> 01:33:25.920
<v Speaker 2>hold my beer and there's just no room </v>
<v Speaker 2>for air.</v>

2010
01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people though.</v>

2011
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Like W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>

2012
01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:34.530
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of the people don't </v>

2013
01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:34.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people were there?</v>

2014
01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably a couple hundred as far.</v>

2015
01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's just 115 people.</v>

2016
01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Croaked yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>

2017
01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:45.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a login.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it.</v>

2018
01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to be honest.</v>

2019
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I accept the activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my thing.</v>

2020
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:53.971
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever want to gamble but I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to take risk and I know that </v>

2021
01:33:53.971 --> 01:33:57.301
<v Speaker 2>that activity has some risk associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it but for me personally the </v>

2022
01:33:57.301 --> 01:34:00.901
<v Speaker 2>benefit outweighs the risk and I also </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend most of my year trying to put in </v>

2023
01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.050
<v Speaker 2>place things that can mitigate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>

2024
01:34:02.051 --> 01:34:07.051
<v Speaker 2>Like jumping all the time and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>current in my suit and I like I'll walk </v>

2025
01:34:07.051 --> 01:34:11.221
<v Speaker 2>away but I've been at plenty of exit </v>
<v Speaker 2>points where the weather wasn't good or </v>

2026
01:34:11.221 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 2>the wind wasn't good or I just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling it.</v>

2027
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:17.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of other peanut pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably had the same feelings and </v>

2028
01:34:17.190 --> 01:34:17.190
<v Speaker 2>there's zipping up their suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to go.</v>

2029
01:34:17.190 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace out man.</v>

2030
01:34:18.461 --> 01:34:23.461
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going go drink a bottle of red wine </v>

2031
01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:23.461
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a glass.</v>

2032
01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:23.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2033
01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be the base jumper that </v>

2034
01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.240
<v Speaker 2>has walked away from more exits than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else on earth.</v>

2035
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:33.241
<v Speaker 2>More than I would like to be the base </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumper that's done more extreme shit </v>

2036
01:34:33.241 --> 01:34:36.150
<v Speaker 2>than anybody else on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many times you think you've </v>

2037
01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:38.251
<v Speaker 2>walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times have you gotten to a </v>

2038
01:34:38.251 --> 01:34:38.251
<v Speaker 2>situation where you're at the starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>line?</v>

2039
01:34:38.251 --> 01:34:38.251
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't feel right.</v>

2040
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.180
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

2041
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of those things will give you a</v>

2042
01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:43.300
<v Speaker 2>two hour hike on the way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2043
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.320
<v Speaker 2>And I kinda don't want to hike down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gets a lot of people too is </v>

2044
01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:48.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2045
01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of hiking involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the youtube videos.</v>

2046
01:34:50.411 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 2>That's about five percent of what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually takes.</v>

2047
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:58.110
<v Speaker 2>My favorite jump in Switzerland is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a two and a half to a three hour walk </v>

2048
01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:58.110
<v Speaker 2>for a 92nd flight.</v>

2049
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So the ratio of busting your ass to </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling is very askew.</v>

2050
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like Disneyland pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's actually fun and it's not </v>

2051
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>full of pedophiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does anyone else feel a pedophile?</v>

2052
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Of course really working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids are.</v>

2053
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Where would you go if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophile?</v>

2054
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And think of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on now.</v>

2055
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like being a freak and go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Strip club.</v>

2056
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2057
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what kills me about Disneyland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids love Disneyland,</v>

2058
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>so we go there quite often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these gangs,</v>

2059
01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen them before?</v>

2060
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:34.950

<v Speaker 1>They were vests like they're in the </v>

2061
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:37.210
<v Speaker 1>hell's angels and their vests are </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered with a Disneyland buttons and </v>

2062
01:35:37.210 --> 01:35:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Patches and Disneyland Employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about?</v>

2063
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are gangs of Disneyland fans and </v>

<v Speaker 1>things where like to get in there there </v>

<v Speaker 1>see the Disneyland gangs.</v>

2066
01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what I was saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His empire a second ago about the </v>

2067
01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:55.720
<v Speaker 1>pedophiles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Hitchhikers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland Waltz,</v>

<v Speaker 1>things too that they would have to </v>

<v Speaker 1>gangs.</v>

2074
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things was they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have one of the rides go down so</v>

2075
01:36:14.541 --> 01:36:19.541
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to make a ride go down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get entry into this stupid </v>

2076
01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:20.600

<v Speaker 1>coaster where you do that loop where you</v>

2081

<v Speaker 1>go upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2082
01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.480
<v Speaker 1>On the top of the loop.</v>

2083
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 1>This dummy through her purse and wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch it on the way down.</v>

2084
01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Like she had this idea how that work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

2085
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 1>It hit the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The it hit first.</v>

2086
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:55.780
<v Speaker 1>The rollercoaster ran over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stopped the rollercoaster and they </v>

2087
01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:57.320
<v Speaker 1>got stuck like three quarters of the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>up through loop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you know everybody's like yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She went to jail.</v>

2090
01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Another you want to hear something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really gross.</v>

2091
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:10.930
<v Speaker 1>One couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a two year old kid and they </v>

2092
01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:11.000
<v Speaker 1>caught them on security cam after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

2093
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Speaker 1>They hung back and they put their kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>near a Disneyland employee and they </v>

2094
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2095
01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.580
<v Speaker 1>went away and stepped away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the kid was like,</v>

2096
01:37:19.581 --> 01:37:24.581
<v Speaker 1>confused in what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this Disneyland employee kept an eye </v>

2097
01:37:24.581 --> 01:37:27.941
<v Speaker 1>on the kid and then called security and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the security took care of the kid and </v>

2098
01:37:27.941 --> 01:37:31.181
<v Speaker 1>then they went to dinner and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks and they went out and then they </v>

2099
01:37:31.181 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 1>went and retrieved a kid afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Security.</v>

2100
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody should have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just imagine the monster.</v>

2101
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be to take your two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old kid?</v>

2102
01:37:39.231 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of having this kid.</v>

2103
01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a great idea.</v>

2104
01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure their home life is amazing.</v>

2105
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Very nourishing monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2106
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you see a school shooting or </v>

2107
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 1>something crazy like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of shit does.</v>

2108
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>You're raising a potential human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of shit happens.</v>

2109
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 3>You have some fucking morons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to have kids.</v>

2110
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 3>And then basically shit shit on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent victim,</v>

2111
01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:06.250
<v Speaker 3>which is my biggest issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the victimization of </v>

2113
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.510
<v Speaker 3>innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts.</v>

2114
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2115
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.130
<v Speaker 3>especially little two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2116
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:19.460
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that someone has that in them</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they could be that fucking stupid </v>

2117
01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 3>that they have that in them and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2118
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 3>I wish that this was an isolated </v>
<v Speaker 3>instance.</v>

2119
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's like quite a few of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

2120
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you're drinking that </v>

2121
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2122
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

2123
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:34.050
<v Speaker 3>The Brian Brain do the same thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your gut.</v>

2124
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2125
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a nootropic and the right brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>is alcohol.</v>

2126
01:38:38.071 --> 01:38:40.560
<v Speaker 3>It's probably bad for your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to counteract the effects.</v>

2127
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I had a sense of Kimchi either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not from for the mind,</v>

2128
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 3>spent some time in Korea and watch this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys pulling that stuff out of the </v>

2129
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 3>ground and they would offer.</v>

2130
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2131
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to Kimchi.</v>

2132
01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:58.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm more convinced now than ever that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus having a bunch of really good </v>

2133
01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:03.591
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guests that explained the benefits of </v>

2134
01:39:03.591 --> 01:39:06.150
<v Speaker 3>probiotics and about how probiotics </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally affect your gut ecosystem that</v>

2135
01:39:06.151 --> 01:39:11.151
<v Speaker 3>affects your personality and your immune</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and just all sorts of different </v>

2136
01:39:11.151 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 3>aspects of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've been eating Kimchi sheet almost</v>

2137
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 3>when I'm at home daily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much daily food by itself.</v>

2138
01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pair it with a meal,</v>

2139
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:24.500
<v Speaker 3>a pair it with a meal usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes I'll just open up a jar </v>

2140
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.710
<v Speaker 3>and just eat a whole jar of the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's disgusting.</v>

2141
01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't do books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today I had Kimchi with elk and </v>

2142
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Jalapenos and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some stuff called no bread.</v>

2143
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Knows a company that makes k n,</v>
<v Speaker 3>O,</v>

2144
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:44.691
<v Speaker 3>w.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make these gluten free breads that </v>

2145
01:39:44.691 --> 01:39:48.381
<v Speaker 3>are made with nuts and almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how's it taste good?</v>

2146
01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 3>It's actually tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2147
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 3>not totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like a good piece of San Francisco.</v>

2148
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Sour dough bread does not taste like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2149
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:59.160
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it tastes good enough.</v>

2150
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It's good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most importantly,</v>

2151
01:40:01.681 --> 01:40:04.200
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't Jack up your glycaemic index.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

2152
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:06.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have an insulin spike.</v>

2153
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You feel good after you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still,</v>

2154
01:40:08.590 --> 01:40:10.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still reading the Quito train?</v>

2155
01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time I will fuck off on </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasion.</v>

2156
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I will fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked off all.</v>

2157
01:40:15.451 --> 01:40:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Last week I was in Hawaii and I fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>off hard.</v>

2158
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Thanksgiving was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>adventure diet for me too.</v>

2159
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.910
<v Speaker 3>I drank every night a dessert every day </v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate whatever I wanted.</v>

2160
01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on vacation.</v>

2161
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to treat this like a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have no restraint and I'm </v>

2162
01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>only gonna gain four pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I worked out every day.</v>

2163
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:40.700
<v Speaker 3>I worked at every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it only take one week to </v>

2164
01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.100
<v Speaker 3>unravel what seems like a lifetime of </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2165
01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.030
<v Speaker 3>And then you start climbing back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the saddle,</v>

2166
01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:43.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2167
01:40:43.591 --> 01:40:45.630
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll just move an inch at a time</v>

2168
01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 3>here in the last two miles along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2169
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good news is I kept working out so </v>

2170
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like I came back home like </v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly out of shape,</v>

2171
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 3>feeling terrible and having gotten drunk</v>
<v Speaker 3>every night.</v>

2172
01:40:57.071 --> 01:41:02.071
<v Speaker 3>I bet if I didn't work every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have gained like seven </v>

2173
01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:02.071
<v Speaker 3>or eight pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2174
01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:06.660
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably at least still kept your </v>

2175
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:06.660
<v Speaker 3>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metabolism of the high.</v>

2176
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2177
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.270
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm going do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna treat it like this.</v>

2178
01:41:10.271 --> 01:41:12.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work out every day so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to think about it,</v>

2179
01:41:12.431 --> 01:41:15.580
<v Speaker 3>so I could just go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're managing guilt?</v>

2180
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat.</v>

2181
01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:22.190
<v Speaker 3>I ate breakfast one day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stayed at this place that had a </v>

2182
01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:26.071
<v Speaker 3>buffet and they had chocolate croissants</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had for chocolate croissants and then </v>

2183
01:41:26.071 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I had two pieces of banana bread and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to sticky buns,</v>

2184
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.900
<v Speaker 3>these sticky buns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

2185
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Then I had all sorts of other food on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of that.</v>

2186
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I just ate like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a glutton.</v>

2187
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't usually do that.</v>

2188
01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:42.250
<v Speaker 3>So it was nice to do it for a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

2189
01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 3>For a day or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 3>But I felt so weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I would go to the gym,</v>

2191
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I literally felt like it was working out</v>
<v Speaker 3>underwater.</v>

2192
01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Like my brother just combating all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>booze and all the shitty food.</v>

2193
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Would that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'll find my gas tank is just done.</v>

2194
01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Like you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you normally like,</v>

2195
01:41:55.781 --> 01:42:00.781
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to warm up and you're just </v>

2196
01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:00.781
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2197
01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm done here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's place that a heavy bag.</v>

2198
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:06.270
<v Speaker 3>And I knew they had a heavy bag so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought boxing gloves and hand wraps and </v>

2199
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:09.991
<v Speaker 3>everything and I have a timer on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone so I set the timer up and I just </v>

2200
01:42:09.991 --> 01:42:13.111
<v Speaker 3>wailed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking great because you know </v>

2201
01:42:13.111 --> 01:42:15.031
<v Speaker 3>those apple ear pods pod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the best apple not to make an </v>

2202
01:42:15.031 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 3>ad for apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably the best thing I've ever bought</v>

2203
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 3>from apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Airpods are great.</v>

2204
01:42:18.791 --> 01:42:20.290
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a um,</v>

2205
01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:25.970
<v Speaker 3>this timer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would play me music but then the </v>

2206
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:26.260
<v Speaker 3>timer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the noise of the time,</v>

2207
01:42:26.261 --> 01:42:27.950
<v Speaker 3>but it would also go through the air </v>
<v Speaker 3>pods.</v>

2208
01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Didn't given both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:31.940
<v Speaker 3>So when it was getting like 10 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 3>it would alert me through the.</v>

2210
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>But I would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

2211
01:42:33.581 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 3>punching the bag and even kicking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bag.</v>

2212
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Those air pods are gonna fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

2213
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't.</v>

2214
01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I've actually yet to have them fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only time I've had them falls when I</v>

2216
01:42:42.571 --> 01:42:45.220
<v Speaker 3>was doing chin ups because my shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so fucking massive.</v>

2217
01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:49.390
<v Speaker 3>It touched my ears so it didn't fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2218
01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:51.070
<v Speaker 3>They were ripped out by your massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders.</v>

2219
01:42:51.150 --> 01:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ears bumped up against my my </v>

2220
01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:56.150
<v Speaker 3>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's it.</v>

2221
01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:57.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time I've ever ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally fallen out.</v>

2222
01:42:57.791 --> 01:43:02.470
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is you take one </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and it knows that you have it out.</v>

2223
01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 3>So the sound stops like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did they figure that out?</v>

2224
01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Wizardry out have no problem talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you while you have headphones on.</v>

2225
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:16.650
<v Speaker 3>They just start talking like they see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the headphones and they just start </v>

2226
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 3>talking to you to pretend like you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear them and you pointed the headphones</v>

2227
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:20.410
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2228
01:43:20.411 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2229
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:21.630
<v Speaker 3>You have to talk to me.</v>

2230
01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 3>They talk louder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if you're on the </v>

2231
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.611
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if you're in the </v>

2232
01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:30.640
<v Speaker 3>middle of the most important audio book </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever getting the secrets of the universe</v>

2233
01:43:30.641 --> 01:43:32.110
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people won't talk to you,</v>

2234
01:43:32.111 --> 01:43:37.111
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that might be more of a problem </v>

2235
01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:38.140
<v Speaker 3>that you deal with as opposed to others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think girls get it more than me.</v>

2236
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I know words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know women who have put a headphones </v>

2237
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:45.400
<v Speaker 3>into their ears and not even attached it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a device.</v>

2238
01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:47.520
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so people will leave them alone.</v>

2239
01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Just stick it right in there posting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you can hear.</v>

2240
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2241
01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if would necessarily</v>

2242

<v Speaker 1>We went to the big island this time.</v>

2246
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Nice split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Linda is the way to go because </v>

2247
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>they ain't nobody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta take two flights from La.</v>

2248
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Hulu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to Honolulu and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a little puddle jumper.</v>

2250
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>A little one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little buddy holly killing planes.</v>

2251
01:44:16.090 --> 01:44:17.760
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine backpack</v>

2252
01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you can borrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ask how much your packs.</v>

2253
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say that.</v>

2254
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:24.000
<v Speaker 1>How much do you weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

2255
01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please don't lie.</v>

2256
01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Actually padded by about 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be okay.</v>

2257
01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they get like a really overly weight </v>

2258
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 1>person who they know might be full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2259
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens ladies.</v>

2260
01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Jack up a couple of pounds when I </v>

2261
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:40.160
<v Speaker 1>was super young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just,</v>

2262
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember that I went on a cruise with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandparents to Alaska.</v>

2263
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we went up to Alaska when we were </v>

2264
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.361
<v Speaker 1>flying back from Alaska puddle jumper to</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably do now to get on the plane and </v>

2265
01:44:51.731 --> 01:44:54.610
<v Speaker 1>they looked at my grandfather like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little up and down.</v>

2266
01:44:54.611 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

2267
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you're on the next flight.</v>

2268
01:44:56.710 --> 01:44:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2269
01:44:57.790 --> 01:45:00.880
<v Speaker 1>They bumped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GRANDPA had a gut grandpa.</v>

2270
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:04.510
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was built big boy.</v>

2271
01:45:04.570 --> 01:45:07.840
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was built from the belly button up to</v>

2272
01:45:07.841 --> 01:45:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a beach ball.</v>

2273
01:45:12.570 --> 01:45:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some like I wouldn't want to be in a </v>

2274
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.570
<v Speaker 1>puddle jumper with a really big guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was full of shit.</v>

2275
01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll kill everybody at some point.</v>

2276
01:45:19.841 --> 01:45:20.560
<v Speaker 1>The plans like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2277
01:45:20.561 --> 01:45:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I know you're pulling back on the yoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually can't take off,</v>

2278
01:45:23.171 --> 01:45:25.570
<v Speaker 1>so you're all going to die now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the way to go either.</v>

2279
01:45:25.571 --> 01:45:30.571
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because someone has an ego and they </v>

2280
01:45:30.571 --> 01:45:30.571
<v Speaker 1>can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are 400 pounds,</v>

2281
01:45:30.571 --> 01:45:30.571
<v Speaker 1>not 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:45:30.571 --> 01:45:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they actually took his luggage </v>

2283
01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:34.740
<v Speaker 1>off and he had to come back like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the next day.</v>

2284
01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is for someone who's </v>

2285
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:40.201
<v Speaker 1>400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to find a scale that goes up </v>

2286
01:45:40.201 --> 01:45:41.440
<v Speaker 1>to 400 pounds or you get a time and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes around.</v>

2287
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:43.960
<v Speaker 1>But Joey Diaz was telling me that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 400 pounds,</v>

2288
01:45:43.961 --> 01:45:45.250
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

2289
01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know how much you weighed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the scale at his doctor's office</v>

2290
01:45:49.421 --> 01:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>only went to 300 pounds and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2291
01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that pegged bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd lose 50 pounds and it </v>

2292
01:45:56.801 --> 01:46:01.570
<v Speaker 1>would still be pegged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's not a good sign.</v>

2293
01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:05.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not a doctor obviously,</v>

2294
01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but I think that all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see all these people that are </v>

2295
01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.370
<v Speaker 1>like morbidly obese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is all a.</v>

2296
01:46:13.371 --> 01:46:15.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shitty food.</v>

2297
01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a bad gut flora addict addiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like refined carbohydrates and </v>

2298
01:46:23.291 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 1>sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

2299
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things that make people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

2300
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is that they don't </v>

2301
01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:34.510
<v Speaker 1>have like real physical challenges in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life on a daily basis.</v>

2302
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Especially physical challenges that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy.</v>

2303
01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:41.940
<v Speaker 1>That forces them to be disciplined about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their health and to understand that </v>

2304
01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.260
<v Speaker 1>their body is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just your body,</v>

2305
01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:48.220
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have this variable vehicle</v>

2306
01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and the time you put</v>

2307
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.050
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you pay attention to it and the</v>

2308
01:46:52.051 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 3>more discipline you use to keep this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing running,</v>

2309
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 3>the better it's going to work for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you use it all the time,</v>

2310
01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:02.270
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you just use it to walk over to </v>

2311
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 3>the couch and crack a beer and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking filling your face with chips and</v>

2312
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:07.560
<v Speaker 3>cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think about what it is and you</v>

2313
01:47:07.561 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 3>don't have to rely on it to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to chop wood.</v>

2314
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to carry anything.</v>

2315
01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:14.660
<v Speaker 2>You gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta.</v>

2316
01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Look on your phone for the right APP to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have uber.</v>

2317
01:47:17.211 --> 01:47:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Deliver your food so you don't even have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get off of your ass.</v>

2318
01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new thing,</v>

2319
01:47:23.181 --> 01:47:28.181
<v Speaker 2>but I bet she gets pretty popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't come to your neck of the </v>

2320
01:47:28.181 --> 01:47:28.181
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet I wouldn't order it.</v>

2321
01:47:28.181 --> 01:47:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Even if it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have restaurants in your town.</v>

2322
01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2323
01:47:32.211 --> 01:47:33.830
<v Speaker 2>We also have electricity and running </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2324
01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do a lot.</v>

2325
01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I do at my house we have in the </v>

2326
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:40.740
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2327
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.270
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you should come visit sometime.</v>

2328
01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the idea of water is God damn.</v>

2329
01:47:44.711 --> 01:47:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2330
01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievably clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spring water.</v>

2331
01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It just tastes different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes different to A.</v>

2332
01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I it,</v>

2333
01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked the small town we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have everything we need.</v>

2334
01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Probably a couple things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably still need and not much of what</v>

2335
01:48:01.521 --> 01:48:03.860
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any crime?</v>

2336
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually.</v>

2337
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you there's some,</v>

2338
01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.950
<v Speaker 2>a little bit off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crime I think any place,</v>

2339
01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.750
<v Speaker 2>so we don't live in white fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White fish is like 15 miles north of us.</v>

2340
01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure there's a large like </v>
<v Speaker 2>white nationalists,</v>

2341
01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:19.310
<v Speaker 2>white supremacists.</v>

2342
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I've read some stuff about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really looked into it too </v>

2343
01:48:26.110 --> 01:48:28.271
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew that they were getting ready </v>

2344
01:48:28.271 --> 01:48:28.271
<v Speaker 3>to do a little bit of a march type </v>
<v Speaker 3>action rally.</v>

2345
01:48:28.271 --> 01:48:29.000
<v Speaker 3>You should walk around everywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>black face.</v>

2346
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an Afro.</v>

2347
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of just driving my truck </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the white nationalist rally is </v>

2348
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:42.170
<v Speaker 3>because my truck is black so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2349
01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the metaphor.</v>

2350
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.790
<v Speaker 3>So if one of them Tiki torches and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you feel me,</v>

2351
01:48:46.791 --> 01:48:50.960
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fucking dickheads.</v>

2352
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those dickheads in Charlotte walking on </v>

2353
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:58.271
<v Speaker 3>the street with home depot torches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still can't figure out if they're </v>

2354
01:48:58.271 --> 01:48:58.530
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2355
01:48:58.670 --> 01:49:02.510
<v Speaker 3>they're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There've been with Home Depot Tiki torch</v>

2356
01:49:02.511 --> 01:49:04.280
<v Speaker 3>in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're serious.</v>

2357
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're serious.</v>

2358
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:07.970
<v Speaker 3>They just want a torch and they're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking stupid.</v>

2359
01:49:07.971 --> 01:49:09.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't really tell that that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be mocked,</v>

2360
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:10.730
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2361
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they even care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just glad they're either</v>

2362
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:18.310
<v Speaker 3>getting coverage so that they feel that </v>
<v Speaker 3>their message is getting out to </v>

2363
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.310
<v Speaker 3>everybody who needs to hear it in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

2364
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:20.660
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't need to hear it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>most people didn't know that there was a</v>

2365
01:49:20.661 --> 01:49:23.690
<v Speaker 3>group that duck fucking stupid that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to go into the streets like that</v>

2366
01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:29.020
<v Speaker 3>and do it in this day and age when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the Internet and people are </v>

2367
01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:29.020
<v Speaker 3>gonna Realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2368
01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.220
<v Speaker 3>you're a Nazi swastika on your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dumb cunt.</v>

2369
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2370
01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go,</v>

2371
01:49:33.471 --> 01:49:38.471
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's that bad up in </v>

2372
01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:38.471
<v Speaker 3>white fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that there is.</v>

2373
01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.520
<v Speaker 3>I have found is like you eat to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>remote areas.</v>

2374
01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:44.750
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a drug related crime might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a tad higher.</v>

2375
01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Gets a little messy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:49:46.431 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure.</v>

2377
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2378
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 1>anecdotally I think from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it seems to be like,</v>

2379
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I feel super comfortable.</v>

2380
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2381
01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2382
01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It feels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels smaller is the only way that I </v>

2383
01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:02.460
<v Speaker 1>can describe it and that feeling fuels </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

2384
01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's peaceful,</v>

2385
01:50:03.191 --> 01:50:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So like not a great word for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slower to it is.</v>

2387
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only regret is that I wish we had.</v>

2388
01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we would.</v>

2389
01:50:13.241 --> 01:50:14.830
<v Speaker 1>We were able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just didn't do it.</v>

2390
01:50:14.831 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had done it a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2391
01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that way about boulder.</v>

2392
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Boulder feels like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vain.</v>

2393
01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Boulder feels to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2394
01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>it's only a 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2395
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:26.890
<v Speaker 1>which is way bigger than your town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 2000.</v>

2396
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it just,</v>

2397
01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:29.630
<v Speaker 1>everything is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2398
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just a calmer folders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting town.</v>

2399
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It reminded me a lot of where I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Santa Cruz,</v>

2400
01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:38.770
<v Speaker 1>very left like great place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're selling Tofu,</v>

2401
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Santa Cruz is a great place to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

2402
01:50:41.781 --> 01:50:43.420
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of people don't leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Cruz.</v>

2403
01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so far left that it ends up on the </v>

2404
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:48.740
<v Speaker 1>right somehow there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2405
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2406
01:50:49.541 --> 01:50:54.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys and girls that I went to high </v>

2407
01:50:54.541 --> 01:50:54.590
<v Speaker 1>school with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them have never left and not</v>

2408
01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 1>that I haven't really maintained contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

2409
01:50:56.441 --> 01:51:01.441
<v Speaker 1>but even if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd have anything to </v>

2410
01:51:01.441 --> 01:51:02.230
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an insulated and the like.</v>

2411
01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So the small town that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2412
01:51:03.701 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I want my kids when they grow up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to that age,</v>

2413
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:10.531
<v Speaker 1>they get to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to go and experience something </v>

2414
01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:10.531
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2415
01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:10.531
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>22,000</v>

2416
01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:11.770
<v Speaker 1>people is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how the world is.</v>

2417
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best thing I did in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz was leaving at some point.</v>

2418
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine has been on the podcast </v>

2419
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.311
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be on this podcast called </v>

2420
01:51:23.311 --> 01:51:23.311
<v Speaker 1>citizens radio and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2421
01:51:23.311 --> 01:51:27.610
<v Speaker 1>like a real heavy duty lefty social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior type character.</v>

2422
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:32.850
<v Speaker 1>And somewhere along the line he ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>afoul of them because he dates girls </v>

2423
01:51:34.241 --> 01:51:39.241
<v Speaker 1>like girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls were calling them a Predator or </v>

2424
01:51:39.241 --> 01:51:39.241
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really didn't do anything wrong.</v>

2425
01:51:39.241 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at it on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2426
01:51:40.061 --> 01:51:41.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he do wrong?</v>

2427
01:51:42.190 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no rape,</v>

2428
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:46.930
<v Speaker 1>there was no assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no harassing.</v>

2429
01:51:46.931 --> 01:51:50.260
<v Speaker 1>It was him trying to get laid a which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was normal,</v>

2430
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but I guess not in that world it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>

2431
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:57.070
<v Speaker 1>But in the social justice world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's problematic to be an aggressive.</v>

2432
01:51:57.071 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 1>A Sexual Predator she did is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>had attorney and really not cool at all.</v>

2433
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 1>But what he said was that when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world,</v>

2434
01:52:04.781 --> 01:52:09.781
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even aware of dissenting </v>

2435
01:52:09.781 --> 01:52:13.231
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints because he was so insulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody in that world thought </v>

2436
01:52:13.231 --> 01:52:17.461
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just get accustomed to these </v>

2437
01:52:17.461 --> 01:52:21.660
<v Speaker 1>very rigid sort of channels of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody sort of follows these </v>

2438
01:52:23.141 --> 01:52:28.141
<v Speaker 1>channels and he literally wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of the possibility of there being </v>

2439
01:52:29.891 --> 01:52:31.570
<v Speaker 1>a dissenting point of view that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>

2440
01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>How do people not realize that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently dangerous?</v>

2441
01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.170
<v Speaker 1>They get caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are super tribal,</v>

2442
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you that I made.</v>

2443
01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2444
01:52:41.531 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's at the same point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I try to recognize myself,</v>

2445
01:52:44.351 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming anything information.</v>

2446
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:48.470
<v Speaker 1>If I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2447
01:52:48.471 --> 01:52:53.471
<v Speaker 1>I need to go and figure something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>out or hear another viewpoint or at </v>

2448
01:52:53.471 --> 01:52:55.250
<v Speaker 1>least try to balance it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the spidey senses started going up.</v>

2449
01:52:55.251 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>If too many people are saying the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2450
01:52:57.051 --> 01:53:02.051
<v Speaker 1>if everybody is all chanted in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on with you might be </v>

2451
01:53:02.051 --> 01:53:02.600
<v Speaker 1>down the rabbit hole here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to take a few steps back.</v>

2452
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because you are a winner.</v>

2453
01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just not tiger blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying.</v>

2454
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:11.780
<v Speaker 1>There's some things that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like unfortunate.</v>

2455
01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this deep desire to have other people</v>

2456
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:23.051
<v Speaker 1>like them and to fit in and to cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero friction and to,</v>

2457
01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:29.150
<v Speaker 1>to be amenable to the group think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2458
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common issue with folks like you </v>

2459
01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:37.721
<v Speaker 1>see them like just slotting into group </v>
<v Speaker 1>think ideology and whether it's group </v>

2460
01:53:37.721 --> 01:53:39.140
<v Speaker 1>think on the right side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group thing.</v>

2461
01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of fucking really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb people that I follow on twitter </v>

2462

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are just apes that are in a</v>

2470

<v Speaker 1>tribe.</v>

2474
01:54:16.841 --> 01:54:18.691
<v Speaker 1>America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that really do feel like it's a </v>

2475
01:54:18.691 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>good thing to have this guy in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market's up,</v>

2476
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about people that have </v>

2477
01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:27.371
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little brain and this tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>little brain just needs to slot into a </v>

2478
01:54:27.411 --> 01:54:31.760
<v Speaker 1>place and this is where they found this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is their spot and then you go onto their</v>

2479
01:54:31.761 --> 01:54:36.761
<v Speaker 1>twitter page and these motherfuckers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all day arguing with people about </v>

2480
01:54:37.461 --> 01:54:40.850
<v Speaker 1>trump all day accomplishing nothing.</v>

2481
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they feel like they've got a huge </v>

2482
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:46.000
<v Speaker 1>microphone and they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely nowhere.</v>

2483
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just everyday they just </v>

2484
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.510
<v Speaker 1>constantly checking their responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking their tweets,</v>

2485

<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what scares me about that is it</v>

2487
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:59.050
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm late to the game to </v>

2488
01:54:59.050 --> 01:54:59.600
<v Speaker 1>everything and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social media late to the game.</v>

2489
01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:04.810
<v Speaker 1>A podcasting late to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was telling you like I'm trying </v>

2490
01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:09.131
<v Speaker 1>to play catch up and I used to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the news and largely accept,</v>

2491
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could corroborate on each side and now</v>

2492
01:55:12.351 --> 01:55:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't look at any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just have to use my own eyes,</v>

2493
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but I see with my own eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people arguing with their head down so </v>

2494
01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:24.311
<v Speaker 1>much about what they believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually not seeing what's </v>

2495
01:55:24.311 --> 01:55:27.221
<v Speaker 1>happening around them and because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusts anything and they only repeat </v>

2496
01:55:27.221 --> 01:55:31.331
<v Speaker 1>what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it provides the seams for people to do </v>

2497
01:55:31.331 --> 01:55:34.781
<v Speaker 1>shit that as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we want to go in that </v>

2498
01:55:34.781 --> 01:55:37.631
<v Speaker 1>direction in that distraction moves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being made that people aren't paying </v>

2499
01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:37.631
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

2500
01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like with all this thing </v>

2501
01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:44.021
<v Speaker 1>about trump and Russia and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that flint is going to turn on </v>

2502
01:55:44.021 --> 01:55:45.310
<v Speaker 1>trump and this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to.</v>

2503
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.430

<v Speaker 1>We are literally a few steps away from </v>

2510
01:56:08.991 --> 01:56:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the brink of a nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not there yet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was getting shot at in the car.</v>

2545
01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>really close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:57:37.130 --> 01:57:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've missed close shots.</v>

2548
01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's welcome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guys just hauling ass.</v>

2550
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he was playing the radio like </v>

2551
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.270
<v Speaker 1>metallica planned?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kickstart my heart.</v>

2552
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metallica.</v>

2553
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going forward North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers for sue,</v>

2554
01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the man while he flees and a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle.</v>

2555
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 1>What kind of cars you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a jeep.</v>

2556
01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a land rover down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he stops the car.</v>

2557
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 1>He gets out and he's running and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting at him from six feet away.</v>

2558
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately the guy on the far right's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a pistol.</v>

2559
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 1>He's not hitting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's tripping over his buddy back.</v>

2560
01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got a rifle though.</v>

2561
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Korean soldier accidentally clock </v>

2562
01:58:22.190 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 1>crosses into South Korea during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>

2563
01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:25.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's the line right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

2564
01:58:26.190 --> 01:58:28.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's all you have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns around.</v>

2565
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So there's not a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2566
01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:36.740
<v Speaker 1>You just have to get to that spot and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about the DMZ shot and </v>

2567
01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:40.281
<v Speaker 1>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The factor is pulled to safety by the </v>

2568
01:58:40.281 --> 01:58:40.281
<v Speaker 1>South Korean military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2569
01:58:40.281 --> 01:58:40.670
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2570
01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 1>these people crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like the South Korean people.</v>

2571
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dragging him.</v>

2572
01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Holy Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about this.</v>

2573
01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the blood trail.</v>

2574
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>

2575
01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than likely on a thermal.</v>

2576
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's intense.</v>

2577
01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 3>That's intense.</v>

2578
01:58:58.070 --> 01:59:03.070
<v Speaker 1>So you want to talk about an iron fist </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictator that's happening right now and </v>

2579
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:05.120
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they can think of is just looking at</v>

2580
01:59:05.121 --> 01:59:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go look at him.</v>

2581
01:59:06.621 --> 01:59:11.621
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out gear.</v>

2582
01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2583
01:59:13.130 --> 01:59:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the rules on the DMZ or </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the actual line is.</v>

2584
01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:19.070
<v Speaker 1>If this video on like South Korea's </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

2585
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:21.140
<v Speaker 1>is that how they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone saw this taken place.</v>

2586
01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:24.140
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like he's driving from north</v>
<v Speaker 1>to south.</v>

2587
01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he just have to get across that </v>

2588
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 1>gate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is this like a DMZ.</v>

2589
01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an unedited version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second at 10 minute version of it.</v>

2590
01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2591
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess they just constantly monitor </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2592
01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:40.690
<v Speaker 3>How weird must that tension between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>north and south of staring at each other</v>

2593
01:59:40.691 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 3>in the opposite side of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they both look exactly the same.</v>

2594
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:46.960
<v Speaker 3>They're both Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2595
01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:49.900
<v Speaker 3>it's like the US wall with Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>

2596
01:59:49.901 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's racist,</v>

2597
01:59:51.011 --> 01:59:56.011
<v Speaker 3>it's racist because one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are proud and when people are </v>

2598
01:59:56.011 --> 01:59:56.410
<v Speaker 3>white they can't even say it's racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

2599
01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 3>They're both the same race just looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at each other.</v>

2600
01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And then there were a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hate each other and one's the enemy</v>

2601
02:00:02.531 --> 02:00:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and one's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One has no money.</v>

2602
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.840
<v Speaker 3>One is under the iron rule of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist military dictatorship where </v>

2603
02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.420
<v Speaker 3>they kill everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one,</v>

2604
02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:12.040
<v Speaker 3>they're making the best cell phones in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2605
02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Chicks were all getting plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2606
02:00:16.450 --> 02:00:21.450
<v Speaker 3>the boys are all fucking hip hop break </v>
<v Speaker 3>dancers and shit and like they have mma </v>

2607
02:00:22.061 --> 02:00:24.160
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have everything that South Korea is</v>

2608
02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that tag windows pretty fucking awesome</v>

2609
02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>souls and awesome town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2610
02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent my 20th birthday in Seoul,</v>

2611
02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bar.</v>

2612
02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:38.060
<v Speaker 3>People that think that socialism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism is the answer to the woes that</v>

2613
02:00:39.141 --> 02:00:42.270
<v Speaker 3>capitalism creates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not understand you.</v>

2614
02:00:42.271 --> 02:00:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Just missing the point that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so contrary to human nature and it </v>

2615
02:00:47.281 --> 02:00:48.000
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2616
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:50.700
<v Speaker 3>never been pulled off successfully in </v>
<v Speaker 3>human history.</v>

2617
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love an example and that's what </v>

2618
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:57.321
<v Speaker 1>I always ask people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me the example of what you </v>

2619
02:00:57.321 --> 02:00:59.631
<v Speaker 1>want to use as the foundation for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>principals where it's been executed </v>

2620
02:00:59.631 --> 02:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's thrived,</v>

2621
02:00:59.911 --> 02:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>where it's survived and I'll just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and wait,</v>

2622
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and another part of the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are really like the </v>

2623
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:11.811
<v Speaker 1>people that are in the left that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really progressive and support Marxism,</v>

2624
02:01:13.261 --> 02:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Marxism and socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are in general,</v>

2625
02:01:17.341 --> 02:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>very supportive of gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very supportive of women's rights.</v>

2626
02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Those are the first things that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>trampled and his communist </v>

2627
02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:29.031
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the first thing that goes like </v>

2628
02:01:29.031 --> 02:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>every single one of these communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists rules,</v>

2629
02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality is treated as the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these people.</v>

2630
02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Did they live in hell that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

2631
02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It is very for me,</v>

2632
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>after a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of my adult life to pick my</v>

2633
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>head up and look around</v>

2634
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2635
02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:50.710
<v Speaker 2>and it most of the interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2636
02:01:50.711 --> 02:01:55.711
<v Speaker 2>as social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sit back and I watch and I see the </v>

2637
02:01:55.711 --> 02:01:57.751
<v Speaker 2>things that people say and I see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaints that they have and oppressed </v>

2638
02:01:57.751 --> 02:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2639
02:01:58.601 --> 02:02:01.450
<v Speaker 2>that or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll be the first person to say that</v>

2640
02:02:01.451 --> 02:02:06.451
<v Speaker 2>there is inequality in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like there is an every nation on </v>

2641
02:02:06.451 --> 02:02:09.841
<v Speaker 2>the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to hear how people think,</v>

2642
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.560
<v Speaker 2>how bad we have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to have seen with my own eyes.</v>

2643
02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Places where people would</v>

2644
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>claw their way,</v>

2645
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:24.110
<v Speaker 2>cross the border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the opportunities that people in</v>

2646
02:02:24.111 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 2>this country have just waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sun rises over the United States and</v>

2647
02:02:28.221 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 2>they wake up and they have so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that they don't appreciate.</v>

2648
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.070
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for me to make sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's going on.</v>

2649
02:02:34.071 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a bizarre place to be in because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like who?</v>

2650
02:02:37.731 --> 02:02:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Who are you people and where do you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas there?</v>

2651
02:02:40.710 --> 02:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Idealistic and they think that we can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and I think that we can do better</v>

2652
02:02:43.951 --> 02:02:48.951
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think where people go a foul is </v>

2653
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:52.701
<v Speaker 1>where they start saying that they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome and equality of </v>

2654
02:02:52.701 --> 02:02:57.441
<v Speaker 1>outcome is contrary to equality because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a quality,</v>

2655
02:02:57.790 --> 02:03:02.790
<v Speaker 1>a quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quality meaning you can do </v>

2656
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That breeds inequality.</v>

2657
02:03:04.711 --> 02:03:09.711
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people are going to work </v>

2658
02:03:09.711 --> 02:03:12.501
<v Speaker 1>harder and competition is what pushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and some people think that </v>

2659
02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:16.971
<v Speaker 1>competition is bad and the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it's bad because it makes </v>

2660
02:03:16.971 --> 02:03:20.031
<v Speaker 1>them feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I put something on twitter today </v>

2661
02:03:20.031 --> 02:03:23.690
<v Speaker 1>where they were saying that fit bits </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people using fitbit's is fat </v>

2662
02:03:24.091 --> 02:03:29.091
<v Speaker 1>shaming and abelist and it's problematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it causes all sorts of issues and </v>

2663
02:03:29.191 --> 02:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these educators,</v>

2664
02:03:30.751 --> 02:03:35.751
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at fitbit's as being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem with the emotions of </v>

2665
02:03:35.751 --> 02:03:35.751
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2666
02:03:35.751 --> 02:03:37.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find out like in.</v>

2667
02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>They start comparing and it can cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of issues with people,</v>

2668
02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>so they were literally saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitbit's,</v>

2669
02:03:43.890 --> 02:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just devices that give you data </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these things can be a problem.</v>

2670
02:03:48.690 --> 02:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>How about competition's a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>

2671
02:03:50.970 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about it's okay to finish last </v>

2672
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 1>because it will motivate you to get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>

2673
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You still on the leaderboard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2674
02:03:57.450 --> 02:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go again.</v>

2675
02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't win every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

2676
02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>It scares me that people are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions like I'm looking at.</v>

2677
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.660
<v Speaker 1>My oldest son is 14 and</v>

2678
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I realized that at some point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the very near future he's going </v>

2679
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:15.231
<v Speaker 2>to go off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna want to pursue a higher </v>

2680
02:04:15.231 --> 02:04:17.181
<v Speaker 2>education and I almost would rather send</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to a trade school where he learns </v>

2681
02:04:17.181 --> 02:04:18.330
<v Speaker 2>something with his hands or I would hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he would.</v>

2682
02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I would never tell him to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that he would want to go </v>

2683
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.061
<v Speaker 2>down that route instead of going into an</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that is completely </v>

2684
02:04:26.061 --> 02:04:29.451
<v Speaker 2>artificial where people portray this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of no rounded corners in nerfed </v>

2685
02:04:31.501 --> 02:04:34.320
<v Speaker 2>everything and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feelings in words hurt and all.</v>

2686
02:04:34.321 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>He talks about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I don't my son to go into</v>

2687
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 1>that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already experiencing that a little </v>

2688
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:45.111
<v Speaker 1>bit in the school system that is in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uses the word triggered and heal.</v>

2689
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>His teachers will use that word </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered and I'm like,</v>

2690
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to have somebody say something</v>

2691
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:55.890
<v Speaker 1>to you that invokes a reaction or </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion in you that causes conflict.</v>

2692
02:04:55.891 --> 02:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't run away from that conflict.</v>

2693
02:04:58.231 --> 02:05:03.231
<v Speaker 1>Once you go directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add that conflict and figure out what </v>

2694
02:05:03.231 --> 02:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>your problem is with it or figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you have an issue with that and then</v>

2695
02:05:03.931 --> 02:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>work through that and you'll be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>person on the other side of the house.</v>

2696
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like these were in a place now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are creating.</v>

2697
02:05:10.801 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It's an artificial environment that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as you leave that environment,</v>

2698
02:05:13.981 --> 02:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your teeth kicked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't.</v>

2699
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I see it trending more and more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the u.</v>

2700
02:05:20.050 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 1>s and I almost think we're getting ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall flat on our face and I almost </v>

2701
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:29.361
<v Speaker 1>think we need to to figure out who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck we are and to pick ourselves back </v>

2702
02:05:29.361 --> 02:05:33.351
<v Speaker 1>up into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into realize that those artificial </v>

2703
02:05:33.351 --> 02:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>environments that people are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>force onto the world.</v>

2704
02:05:35.641 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work in campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cities and towns that have campuses.</v>

2705
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2706
02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:46.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just really heavy duty leftwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are just committed to this </v>

2707
02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>ideology and they don't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2708
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:55.430
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to have people that </v>

2709
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>lean left and people that lean right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to figure out which,</v>

2710
02:05:56.510 --> 02:06:01.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced way works and by the way it's </v>

2711
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:04.071
<v Speaker 1>gonna work better for some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people to be left and is going to </v>

2712
02:06:04.071 --> 02:06:04.071
<v Speaker 1>work better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people it'll be right,</v>

2713
02:06:04.071 --> 02:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but this lack of tolerance for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's ideas is one of the most </v>

2714
02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.590
<v Speaker 1>shocking things about the left these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days is this,</v>

2715
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:13.650
<v Speaker 1>this need and desire to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

2716
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:14.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2717
02:06:15.090 --> 02:06:17.580
<v Speaker 1>there was also the people who are on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of saying,</v>

2718
02:06:17.581 --> 02:06:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech,</v>

2719
02:06:18.661 --> 02:06:20.130
<v Speaker 1>but not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not anymore,</v>

2720
02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be.</v>

2721
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:26.530
<v Speaker 1>The new left is more stifling of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech than the right by far the new </v>

2722
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 1>left would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
02:06:28.471 --> 02:06:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd call neo Marxism or postmoderns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I look at it differently,</v>

2724
02:06:32.971 --> 02:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>like freedom of speech to me in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not about what I can say to you.</v>

2725
02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not about me saying I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say something,</v>

2726
02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up and try to offend you.</v>

2727
02:06:41.641 --> 02:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech is how much can I </v>

2728
02:06:46.641 --> 02:06:49.161
<v Speaker 1>tolerate from somebody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much am I willing to listen to an </v>

2729
02:06:49.161 --> 02:06:53.181
<v Speaker 1>opinion that I absolutely hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to allow it to exist </v>

2730
02:06:53.181 --> 02:06:56.601
<v Speaker 1>because I'm grateful that we have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that that can exist in and </v>

2731
02:06:56.601 --> 02:06:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get pulled into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>public square and get your head cut off?</v>

2732
02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly that,</v>

2733
02:06:58.261 --> 02:07:02.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the only way you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out which idea is correct is you have to</v>

2734
02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:04.590
<v Speaker 1>have debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have open debate.</v>

2735
02:07:04.890 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate your ideas freely,</v>

2736
02:07:08.730 --> 02:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate your ideas freely and the </v>

2737
02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:16.251
<v Speaker 1>other person just bulldozes you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas because they think they're </v>

2738
02:07:16.251 --> 02:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>right and I'm going to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else's opinion because I'm </v>

2739
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:20.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how you handle free speech.</v>

2740
02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The way you have to tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion isn't allowed,</v>

2741
02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:23.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2742
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:26.310
<v Speaker 1>You handle bad speech with more better </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech you,</v>

2743
02:07:26.311 --> 02:07:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become.</v>

2744
02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to have your arguments laid out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's convincing to the people</v>

2745
02:07:33.211 --> 02:07:38.211
<v Speaker 1>that are paying attention and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that if your speech is stifled and </v>

2746
02:07:38.211 --> 02:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that's what's really a problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left these days and it's just.</v>

2747
02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think a big part of it is these </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial environments you're talking </v>

2748
02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>about the they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2749
02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>they live in these insulated things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was saying,</v>

2750
02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:52.021
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Kilstein used to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in these insulated </v>

2751
02:07:52.021 --> 02:07:54.541
<v Speaker 1>environments where they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and they think they're doing the </v>

2752
02:07:54.541 --> 02:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>right thing by behaving like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so short sighted.</v>

2753
02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2754
02:07:55.961 --> 02:07:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't try to make a character judgment</v>

2755
02:07:57.791 --> 02:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me in my mind again with,</v>

2756
02:08:01.331 --> 02:08:06.331
<v Speaker 1>with my own eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest threat to this </v>

2757
02:08:06.331 --> 02:08:06.331
<v Speaker 1>country is political correctness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces.</v>

2758
02:08:06.331 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly think that teaching people in </v>

2759
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that manner or getting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting them,</v>

2760
02:08:11.651 --> 02:08:16.651
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to think that that is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world outside of that environment </v>

2761
02:08:16.651 --> 02:08:19.870
<v Speaker 1>operates is setting you up for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm failure because you're going to</v>

2762
02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:24.871
<v Speaker 1>just get crushed because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of other entities throughout the </v>

2763
02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:27.670
<v Speaker 1>world that we'll look at what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and say,</v>

2764
02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

2765
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 1>You're just teeing it up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a complete vulnerability.</v>

2766
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:34.630
<v Speaker 1>They're going to leverage that against </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and manipulate,</v>

2767
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:39.870
<v Speaker 1>not manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just attack the fact that those people </v>

2768
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll take it as a weakness and </v>

2769
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll leverage that for their success </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with them we're fucked.</v>

2770
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think we're fucked </v>

2771
02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:48.961
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's enough people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are paying attention to think it's </v>

2772
02:08:48.961 --> 02:08:51.181
<v Speaker 1>terrible and there's a lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that when something like </v>

2773
02:08:51.181 --> 02:08:54.631
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I thought that </v>

2774
02:08:54.631 --> 02:08:56.461
<v Speaker 1>was really interesting right after nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 was his rallying cry of </v>

2775
02:08:56.461 --> 02:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>patriotism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody had an American flag on </v>

2776
02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.440
<v Speaker 1>their car just like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting to me.</v>

2777
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Did they have them hanging over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpasses up here in la?</v>

2778
02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in San Diego that week.</v>

2779
02:09:08.110 --> 02:09:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I would say it was about a week after </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>

2780
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I have never in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt a level of solidarity of,</v>

2781
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>of just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2782
02:09:16.031 --> 02:09:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but people were nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were nicer.</v>

2783
02:09:20.051 --> 02:09:21.400
<v Speaker 1>They were more upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't.</v>

2784
02:09:21.401 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They weren't really worried that you cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>them off in traffic.</v>

2785
02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:24.850
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the parking spot.</v>

2786
02:09:24.851 --> 02:09:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2787
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you can put your cart in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Grocery store for us against them.</v>

2788
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>How fleeting was that freedom hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing during that time </v>

2789
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.011
<v Speaker 1>period to the overpasses and San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American flags hanging like not just an </v>

2790
02:09:38.011 --> 02:09:41.080
<v Speaker 1>American flag covered the entire thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>

2791
02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I've in longer in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

2792
02:09:43.661 --> 02:09:46.690
<v Speaker 1>it lasts for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of have a daily reminder.</v>

2793
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling there was different.</v>

2794
02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.690
<v Speaker 1>They were just to change the Way New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City was New York City.</v>

2795
02:09:52.691 --> 02:09:57.691
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like a village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have a friendly village that had </v>

2796
02:09:57.691 --> 02:10:00.571
<v Speaker 1>been attacked and everybody was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>super thankful that they were alive and </v>

2797
02:10:00.571 --> 02:10:02.290
<v Speaker 1>supportive of each other and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solidarity.</v>

2798
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sebastian younger is a war journalist.</v>

2799
02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:10.531
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard of him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to every podcast you've </v>

2800
02:10:10.531 --> 02:10:12.871
<v Speaker 1>done with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Restrepo is one of my favorite </v>

2801
02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:12.871
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking amazing.</v>

2802
02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:14.950
<v Speaker 1>His book tribe changed the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>

2803
02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2804
02:10:15.971 --> 02:10:20.971
<v Speaker 1>this is a natural part of being human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like we were talking about these </v>

2805
02:10:20.971 --> 02:10:24.301
<v Speaker 1>reward systems that are built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that loud tigers and like they,</v>

2806
02:10:25.190 --> 02:10:29.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't get the natural release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These natural reward systems for good or</v>

2807
02:10:29.771 --> 02:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>for bad human beings are designed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with conflict,</v>

2808
02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>look real conflict,</v>

2809
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 3>and when we don't have real conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we make up our own bullshit conflict and</v>

2810
02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:44.141
<v Speaker 3>when real conflict shows itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everything sort of normalizes and </v>

2811
02:10:44.141 --> 02:10:45.590
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's for good or for bad.</v>

2812
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:48.740
<v Speaker 3>We haven't evolved past that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever our DNA is,</v>

2813
02:10:48.741 --> 02:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>whatever our programming is and are very</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost at a cellular level.</v>

2814
02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 3>We're designed to have a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of risk and when we don't have that risk</v>

2815
02:10:57.951 --> 02:11:02.951
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have that danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't feel good and you lash out at </v>

2816
02:11:02.951 --> 02:11:04.670
<v Speaker 3>people with your egg icon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These motherfuckers,</v>

2817
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill you unless you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>here in my face and then I wouldn't say </v>

2818
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.140
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2819
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:12.380
<v Speaker 3>it was a credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2820
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching the second airplane </v>
<v Speaker 3>go in live,</v>

2821
02:11:15.141 --> 02:11:20.141
<v Speaker 3>standing in an apartment in San Diego </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking this might change some things.</v>

2822
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2823
02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I remember just waking up.</v>

2824
02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Someone called me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were you living at the time I was </v>

2825
02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:32.381
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was getting some phone calls from </v>

2826
02:11:32.381 --> 02:11:32.381
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2827
02:11:32.381 --> 02:11:32.381
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turn on the news.</v>

2828
02:11:32.381 --> 02:11:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Turn on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned on the news and you're like,</v>

2829
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:36.950
<v Speaker 3>just having an all sink in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck?</v>

2830
02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:40.450
<v Speaker 3>And then me and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a picture of it.</v>

2831
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Me and Eddie Bravo and Joey Diaz went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get burritos and there wasn't a fucking </v>

2832
02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.680
<v Speaker 3>plane in the sky and we're hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day because all air travel had been</v>

2833
02:11:48.681 --> 02:11:52.750
<v Speaker 3>suspended and we were just hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking how fucking bizarre it as we're</v>

2834
02:11:52.751 --> 02:11:53.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2835
02:11:53.121 --> 02:11:55.460
<v Speaker 3>are we at war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the hell?</v>

2836
02:11:55.490 --> 02:12:00.490
<v Speaker 3>How is this going to change everything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did Eddie feel better because there </v>

2837
02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:01.280
<v Speaker 3>weren't econ trails up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't the same guy back then.</v>

2838
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't that deep into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2839
02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.760
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He liked aliens back then.</v>

2840
02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.220
<v Speaker 3>He was into like Nibiru.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He as he became older,</v>

2841
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:14.330
<v Speaker 3>he became way more conspiratorial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard.</v>

2842
02:12:15.070 --> 02:12:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I know I've texted you before like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2843
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:20.570
<v Speaker 3>does he actually think those things or </v>
<v Speaker 3>is he.</v>

2844
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>He loves conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he thinks of them almost like </v>

2845
02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.770
<v Speaker 3>some people like paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

2846
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:33.850
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also like Illuminati </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that he legitimately worries that </v>

2847
02:12:33.850 --> 02:12:38.351
<v Speaker 3>like Hillary Clinton is going to off him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he talks to his shed about I </v>

2848
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:44.390
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's entirely possible the </v>

2849
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:47.501
<v Speaker 3>Clintons are murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's entirely possible </v>

2850
02:12:47.501 --> 02:12:47.730
<v Speaker 3>themselves are outsourced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outsourced yet.</v>

2851
02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have the stones to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2852
02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:52.670
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they've definitely made some</v>

2853
02:12:52.671 --> 02:12:56.270
<v Speaker 3>calls or at least had some meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2854
02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just too many bodies,</v>

2855
02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.450
<v Speaker 3>many people attached to them that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>in critical positions that either like,</v>

2856
02:13:02.451 --> 02:13:07.451
<v Speaker 3>one recent guy vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that Seth Rich Guy who is the New </v>

2857
02:13:07.451 --> 02:13:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Yorker Dad worked at the DNC that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

2858
02:13:08.630 --> 02:13:13.630
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough of them and then they go </v>

2859
02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:13.630
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stories go away.</v>

2860
02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:16.120
<v Speaker 3>The one that I pulled up the other day </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a who's who would,</v>

2861
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:21.160
<v Speaker 3>who would we do in the podcast was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who had dirt on the Clinton </v>

2862
02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 3>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an academic and he vanished.</v>

2863
02:13:23.301 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 3>The guy vanished and you don't hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2864
02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:29.930
<v Speaker 3>This guy was about to like give dirt on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Clinton Foundation and they're like,</v>

2865
02:13:29.931 --> 02:13:31.680
<v Speaker 3>whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just not around anymore.</v>

2866
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Can't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their ability to hide and not </v>

2867
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:40.911
<v Speaker 2>just their academic at heart of Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirt champion vanishes leaving trail of </v>

2868
02:13:40.911 --> 02:13:42.480
<v Speaker 2>questions because he's still missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2869
02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of the Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

2870
02:13:43.921 --> 02:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the Clinton campaign.</v>

2871
02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the Clinton Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2872
02:13:48.090 --> 02:13:48.840
<v Speaker 2>he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2873
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poof,</v>

2874
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's amazing the ability </v>

2875
02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:57.000
<v Speaker 2>for people to have the public face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then who they are.</v>

2876
02:13:57.630 --> 02:14:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not personally had any </v>

2877
02:14:02.630 --> 02:14:05.361
<v Speaker 2>interactions with Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have some firsthand friends that </v>

2878
02:14:05.361 --> 02:14:10.221
<v Speaker 2>have had direct interactions with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>from either a security detail </v>

2879
02:14:10.221 --> 02:14:14.841
<v Speaker 2>perspective or being on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>securing an area that she was traveling </v>

2880
02:14:14.971 --> 02:14:19.971
<v Speaker 2>through and the public face that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts on and how she treated those </v>

2881
02:14:19.971 --> 02:14:24.891
<v Speaker 2>individuals up to and including people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were tasked with her personal </v>

2882
02:14:24.891 --> 02:14:25.980
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upclose detailed the store is that those</v>

2883
02:14:25.981 --> 02:14:30.981
<v Speaker 2>people have would melt your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of those stories come out.</v>

2884
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:36.650
<v Speaker 2>There's the person that she portrays </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself to be during the election cycle </v>

2885
02:14:36.650 --> 02:14:40.581
<v Speaker 2>and this is who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he talked to all these people </v>

2886
02:14:40.581 --> 02:14:42.531
<v Speaker 2>who live at a day to day level with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and the difference between </v>

2887
02:14:42.531 --> 02:14:43.230
<v Speaker 2>the two is like sitting there trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>broad jump the grand canyon.</v>

2888
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely blows my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is about her in particular and her </v>

2889
02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:53.301
<v Speaker 2>hatred or what they had told me her </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred for basically in essentially </v>

2890
02:14:53.301 --> 02:14:55.830
<v Speaker 2>people in military or people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to support her doing her job.</v>

2891
02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Just the anger and vitriol that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>would attack those people with on a </v>

2892
02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:04.160
<v Speaker 2>daily level is unbelievable anger at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military and angry 100 percent of the.</v>

2893
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>She was literally campaigning to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commander in chief of the military just </v>

2894
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:15.630
<v Speaker 2>because it comes out of how did she </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave to them?</v>

2895
02:15:16.290 --> 02:15:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best stories that I have was </v>

2896
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:25.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say the Agency of the person </v>

2897
02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.150
<v Speaker 2>worked for was basically she was exiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House and he said,</v>

2898
02:15:27.211 --> 02:15:28.170
<v Speaker 2>good morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Clinton.</v>

2899
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And he was in a uniform at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she stopped and turned around and she </v>

2900
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.470
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2901
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.630
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go fuck yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk to me when I'm,</v>

2902
02:15:33.631 --> 02:15:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in going in between place a to place b,</v>

2903
02:15:35.641 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 2>wherever she was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got back in her car.</v>

2904
02:15:37.201 --> 02:15:42.201
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yourself more that I have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of the story again,</v>

2905
02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:48.290
<v Speaker 2>not personally for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically saying the things that </v>

2906
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I've heard other people say to me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence directly,</v>

2907
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:50.820
<v Speaker 2>but their uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories correct.</v>

2908
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Uniformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that be.</v>

2909
02:15:52.381 --> 02:15:54.450
<v Speaker 2>It could be a military secret service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>

2910
02:15:54.451 --> 02:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>They wear a uniform also in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories.</v>

2911
02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:02.360
<v Speaker 2>She 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same behavior when the </v>

2912
02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 2>cameras are not rolling and it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying because yes,</v>

2913
02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:07.620
<v Speaker 2>she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is campaigning or was campaigning to</v>

2914
02:16:07.621 --> 02:16:11.310
<v Speaker 2>be the commander in chief of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I can tell again,</v>

2915
02:16:11.311 --> 02:16:13.980
<v Speaker 2>having no direct relations with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

2916
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:17.740
<v Speaker 2>a person that despises almost I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe,</v>

2917
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I would describe it at that is what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization stands for.</v>

2918
02:16:20.970 --> 02:16:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised.</v>

2919
02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what stunned me is how the left was </v>

2920
02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>willing to just absolve her of her.</v>

2921
02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.640
<v Speaker 3>She was against gay marriage until 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her obvious belief system,</v>

2922
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:43.860
<v Speaker 3>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who she actually is versus like what </v>

2923
02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what she's doing is being</v>

2924
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 3>a slick politician just like her husband</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>

2925
02:16:47.321 --> 02:16:49.930
<v Speaker 3>She is the tide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She may also rise and fall with whatever</v>

2926
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:54.931
<v Speaker 3>the trend is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 2013 thing like the fact that like </v>

2927
02:16:54.931 --> 02:16:54.931
<v Speaker 3>how could you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2928
02:16:54.931 --> 02:16:58.900
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck who's educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck was a Democrat at 2013,</v>

2929
02:16:58.901 --> 02:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>still thought that a marriage should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>between a man and woman who gives a shit</v>

2930
02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>like she did because that's what she </v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

2931
02:17:05.681 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 3>She licks her fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she finds out whether it was blowing and</v>

2932
02:17:08.591 --> 02:17:11.830
<v Speaker 3>she goes that way and when you see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between what call me,</v>

2933
02:17:11.831 --> 02:17:16.831
<v Speaker 3>sad about the investigation and what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation and found on her emails </v>

2934
02:17:16.831 --> 02:17:20.941
<v Speaker 3>and what the illegal activity that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>had participated in versus what she </v>

2935
02:17:20.941 --> 02:17:25.141
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the deleted emails at </v>

2936
02:17:25.141 --> 02:17:27.300
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>deleted emails and all that stuff and </v>

2937
02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:28.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that shows what he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus what she said.</v>

2938
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Play them back to back with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like how anybody could support her.</v>

2939
02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:33.640
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you wanted someone other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than Donald Trump,</v>

2940
02:17:33.730 --> 02:17:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you wanted a woman and </v>

2941
02:17:38.730 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 3>historical first for equality of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I get that too?</v>

2942
02:17:39.401 --> 02:17:44.401
<v Speaker 3>But this is not your one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a lot of women out </v>

2943
02:17:44.401 --> 02:17:44.750
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two choices we had at of what,</v>

2944
02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:48.370
<v Speaker 3>360 plus million people now God do </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

2945
02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:50.650
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's proof that the system is broken.</v>

2946
02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2947
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 3>It's compromised for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2948
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 3>the only thing good about having a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump in his,</v>

2949
02:17:55.810 --> 02:17:59.740
<v Speaker 3>he's not from the system has that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>used all of his money and kind of jumped</v>

2950
02:17:59.741 --> 02:18:03.190
<v Speaker 3>in and the financial system is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>being supported obviously because he's a</v>

2951
02:18:03.191 --> 02:18:05.530
<v Speaker 3>big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the political system is in chaos.</v>

2952
02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not a part of that at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>and never was so,</v>

2953
02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.640
<v Speaker 3>so besides donating money to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the only thing that people </v>

2954
02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:14.050
<v Speaker 3>thought was a saving grace about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>being an office.</v>

2955
02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Like let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think he's crazy.</v>

2956
02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I think he might literally have </v>
<v Speaker 3>dementia.</v>

2957
02:18:19.690 --> 02:18:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I just wish that somebody would grab his</v>
<v Speaker 3>film.</v>

2958
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Just real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they try?</v>

2959
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:26.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like real quick and just modify the</v>

2960
02:18:26.981 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 3>APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2961
02:18:27.461 --> 02:18:32.461
<v Speaker 3>but before he hits tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes to like one or two people who </v>

2962
02:18:32.461 --> 02:18:33.230
<v Speaker 3>give it just a quick sanity check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Da.</v>

2963
02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:38.110
<v Speaker 3>And then they're like proof check </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter chats.</v>

2964
02:18:38.111 --> 02:18:43.111
<v Speaker 3>He checks his comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking people I know people are </v>

2965
02:18:43.111 --> 02:18:46.741
<v Speaker 3>proud about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard you talking about now I've </v>

2966
02:18:46.741 --> 02:18:46.741
<v Speaker 3>looked at like I'm blocked by presidents</v>
<v Speaker 3>like man,</v>

2967
02:18:46.741 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

2968
02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I look at that as people have their head</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2969
02:18:51.011 --> 02:18:56.011
<v Speaker 3>not paying attention to what they should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be paying attention to because in those </v>

2970
02:18:56.011 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 3>seams that people blowing their mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>over a tweet,</v>

2971
02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:02.400
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is getting passed through </v>
<v Speaker 3>in regulations and bills and unlike if </v>

2972
02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:05.700
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit that scares me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the EPA shit scares me the most because </v>

2973
02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:07.270
<v Speaker 3>you know what they're doing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national monuments.</v>

2974
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:08.920
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a meeting this morning.</v>

2975
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:10.610
<v Speaker 3>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2976
02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:13.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you do to the different parks </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2977
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he shrunk by a whole lot to pull it </v>

2978
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:19.800
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2979
02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very scary because you're carving </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a land and national monuments for </v>

2980
02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:26.920
<v Speaker 3>privatization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was one that um,</v>

2981
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:30.890
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about in Alaska that's</v>

2982
02:19:30.891 --> 02:19:34.430
<v Speaker 3>very close to a gigantic salmon fishery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump's shrinks,</v>

2983
02:19:34.431 --> 02:19:39.431
<v Speaker 3>Utah monuments in historic move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder which one make that bigger </v>

2984
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.120
<v Speaker 3>police or to read it.</v>

2985
02:19:43.390 --> 02:19:46.040
<v Speaker 3>If only the sandstone stands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stones could sing.</v>

2986
02:19:46.041 --> 02:19:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the stories they tell of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>

2987
02:19:48.051 --> 02:19:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Mammoth hunters and ancient ones known </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the Anasazi.</v>

2988
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:56.950
<v Speaker 3>All Rome southern Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over the eons longer for the native </v>

2989
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Americans struggled to hold their land </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the Mormon settlers.</v>

2990
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:02.531
<v Speaker 3>Modern life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now Donald Trump scroll as president</v>

2991
02:20:02.541 --> 02:20:05.030
<v Speaker 3>trump arrives in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday afternoon.</v>

2992
02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:09.260
<v Speaker 3>It's this rocky corner of the wild west </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a battlefield once again,</v>

2993
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:12.680
<v Speaker 3>but this time the warriors were carried </v>
<v Speaker 3>briefcases and lawsuits.</v>

2994
02:20:12.681 --> 02:20:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Trump by signing to presidential </v>
<v Speaker 3>proclamations on Monday,</v>

2995
02:20:15.371 --> 02:20:20.371
<v Speaker 3>shrunk the size of bears ears national </v>
<v Speaker 3>monument by more than 80 percent and the</v>

2996
02:20:21.531 --> 02:20:26.180
<v Speaker 3>grand staircase Escalante National </v>
<v Speaker 3>Monument by roughly 45 percent.</v>

2997
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally reshaping the two large </v>
<v Speaker 3>national monuments.</v>

2998
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that guy.</v>

2999
02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3000
02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me a why other than to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's got to be an economical </v>

3001
02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:43.740
<v Speaker 3>motivation behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Resources has got to be national </v>

3002
02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.770
<v Speaker 3>resources got to be minerals or oil or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3003
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:46.610
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's my thing.</v>

3004
02:20:46.611 --> 02:20:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you go to Fox News,</v>

3005
02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:50.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

3006
02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 3>every leading above the brake article is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary.</v>

3007
02:20:53.541 --> 02:20:54.790
<v Speaker 3>This hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3008
02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Why is that not leading really </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>

3009
02:20:59.910 --> 02:21:01.520
<v Speaker 3>their little puppets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3010
02:21:01.521 --> 02:21:03.630
<v Speaker 3>this idea that they're there just for </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

3011
02:21:03.631 --> 02:21:05.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a puppet of the GOP.</v>

3012
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:07.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Really American.</v>

3013
02:21:08.170 --> 02:21:11.510
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're corrupt as everybody else's.</v>

3014
02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.370
<v Speaker 3>They're the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

3015
02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:14.300
<v Speaker 3>The thing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

3016
02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:17.510
<v Speaker 3>you have blind allegiance towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president when he does stuff like this.</v>

3017
02:21:17.511 --> 02:21:19.120
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to call it.</v>

3018
02:21:19.121 --> 02:21:21.140
<v Speaker 3>And some people do like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shepherd.</v>

3019
02:21:21.141 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shepard Shepard Smith.</v>

3020
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

3021
02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.040
<v Speaker 3>The perfect eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He calls the president and I don't know </v>

3022
02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:31.800
<v Speaker 3>if I've ever seen as eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to take.</v>

3023
02:21:31.801 --> 02:21:36.801
<v Speaker 3>Seems it seems like he could have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those guys that was upset at </v>

3024
02:21:36.801 --> 02:21:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton up until about 2013.</v>

3025
02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3026
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I hear what you're putting down </v>

3027
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3028
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people are,</v>

3029
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:48.920
<v Speaker 3>they're losing their mind about tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the monument got cut by 80 </v>

3030
02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:50.620
<v Speaker 3>percent and another one by 45 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

3031
02:21:50.650 --> 02:21:53.940
<v Speaker 3>and that's one example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that and I agree with you.</v>

3032
02:21:53.941 --> 02:21:56.510
<v Speaker 3>They are corrupt and what I have found </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself in,</v>

3033
02:21:56.530 --> 02:22:01.530
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think is dangerous is that I've </v>

3034
02:22:01.530 --> 02:22:01.530
<v Speaker 3>stopped paying attention and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens,</v>

3035
02:22:01.530 --> 02:22:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the hell is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3036
02:22:03.801 --> 02:22:08.801
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens with a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people just want to eat </v>

3037
02:22:08.801 --> 02:22:11.591
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you can't do anything </v>

3038
02:22:11.591 --> 02:22:11.990
<v Speaker 3>other than vote right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boat and protest and you have a job at a</v>

3039
02:22:11.991 --> 02:22:13.730
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you have time to protest?</v>

3040
02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:18.940
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of people shut out because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't feel like they don't </v>

3041
02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:21.971
<v Speaker 3>feel like they can represent their </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions in a way that's going to be </v>

3042
02:22:21.971 --> 02:22:24.890
<v Speaker 3>meaningful and impactful and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible.</v>

3043
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>The job of having one chief monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the controls,</v>

3044
02:22:29.431 --> 02:22:32.370
<v Speaker 3>300 plus million people and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition.</v>

3045
02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then here's the thing,</v>

3046
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:38.070
<v Speaker 3>if you are the chief monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they show that you're a liar,</v>

3047
02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:40.830
<v Speaker 3>if they can show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's proof that you're a liar,</v>

3048
02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:43.860
<v Speaker 3>should be removed from office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get,</v>

3049
02:22:43.970 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 3>if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are in court,</v>

3050
02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:52.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you swear on a Bible and the you </v>

3051
02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:56.960
<v Speaker 3>commit perjury you'd go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why is swearing into office for the</v>

3052
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:05.030
<v Speaker 3>United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that less of a like a a situation</v>

3053
02:23:06.121 --> 02:23:11.121
<v Speaker 3>where you can be charged with perjury </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that seems to me to be far more </v>

3054
02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:11.121
<v Speaker 3>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3055
02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:13.200
<v Speaker 3>you're literally in control of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

3056
02:23:13.201 --> 02:23:18.201
<v Speaker 3>You can do things like this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that he signed that shrinks these </v>

3057
02:23:18.201 --> 02:23:21.891
<v Speaker 3>monuments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these horrible reductions in the power </v>

3058
02:23:21.891 --> 02:23:24.771
<v Speaker 3>that the EPA has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking environmental protection </v>

3059
02:23:24.771 --> 02:23:26.730
<v Speaker 3>agency is to protect our very </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

3060
02:23:26.730 --> 02:23:27.050
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3061
02:23:27.051 --> 02:23:27.230
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3062
02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.530
<v Speaker 3>We don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even protection.</v>

3063
02:23:28.531 --> 02:23:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got me.</v>

3064
02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think that he would be held </v>

3065
02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:37.700
<v Speaker 3>more accountable because the stakes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much higher and it affects so many </v>

3066
02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:37.700
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3067
02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean the amount of lies that he's told</v>
<v Speaker 3>since office or they're stunning and you</v>

3068
02:23:41.041 --> 02:23:46.041
<v Speaker 3>can just get away with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be able to get away with </v>

3069
02:23:46.041 --> 02:23:46.041
<v Speaker 3>lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a president,</v>

3070
02:23:46.041 --> 02:23:47.490
<v Speaker 3>I think lies as a president willingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>lie.</v>

3071
02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.430
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing to be misinformed but </v>
<v Speaker 3>willingly lying as the president,</v>

3072
02:23:51.431 --> 02:23:56.431
<v Speaker 3>if they can show that you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>information to the contrary of what </v>

3073
02:23:56.431 --> 02:23:57.240
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be removed from office should</v>

3074
02:23:57.241 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 3>be a disqualifying factor for sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

3075
02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:05.030
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've never had someone that lives </v>

3076
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.270
<v Speaker 3>this much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't know about it.</v>

3077
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one has been able to be proven to be </v>

3078
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.670
<v Speaker 3>this much of a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never had that.</v>

3079
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Where someone lies so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3080
02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:16.560
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a website that was </v>

3081
02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:19.161
<v Speaker 3>documenting the number of times trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>lied or it was like they documented all </v>

3082
02:24:20.111 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 3>of the trump lies over the past year and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

3083
02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:28.580
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so frustrating.</v>

3084
02:24:30.271 --> 02:24:33.390
<v Speaker 3>As of June 23rd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>

3085
02:24:33.391 --> 02:24:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Here's a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3086
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

3087
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:41.540
<v Speaker 3>What's the website?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calls from the New York Times flies on </v>

3088
02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.481
<v Speaker 3>top to scroll up and we could make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>larger so I could read it here.</v>

3089
02:24:44.730 --> 02:24:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3090
02:24:45.961 --> 02:24:46.260
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3091
02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to read them.</v>

3092
02:24:51.061 --> 02:24:56.061
<v Speaker 3>I'll just get super depressed where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only issue I have with that is that </v>

3093
02:24:56.061 --> 02:24:59.601
<v Speaker 3>people are really quick to jump on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bandwagon and all I would say is you </v>

3094
02:24:59.601 --> 02:25:01.260
<v Speaker 3>should be prepared to have that level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>scrutiny thrown back on yourself.</v>

3095
02:25:01.290 --> 02:25:03.200
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because my,</v>

3096
02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean how fucking long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody else's list B,</v>

3097
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the one thing that </v>

3098
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.870
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like once you get into office,</v>

3099
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:11.190
<v Speaker 3>would that list be the same?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you knew,</v>

3100
02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.280
<v Speaker 3>like if I say Andy Stump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you swear to take the office of the </v>

3101
02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:20.420
<v Speaker 3>United States president and then to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing hand on the Bible from </v>

3102
02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:21.390
<v Speaker 3>there on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to know that you have to keep</v>

3103
02:25:21.391 --> 02:25:23.130
<v Speaker 3>your fucking shit together a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

3104
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 3>You can't lie.</v>

3105
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3106
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3107
02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish people would take that level of </v>

3108
02:25:32.130 --> 02:25:32.130
<v Speaker 2>accountability on themselves as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3109
02:25:32.130 --> 02:25:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I think the country would be a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>place if people acted as if there was an</v>

3110
02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>organization ready to write down a list </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their deficiencies at any given time.</v>

3111
02:25:38.711 --> 02:25:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I think you're totally right.</v>

3112
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I think you're totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that what we're seeing is </v>

3113
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:48.830
<v Speaker 3>for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a president that is showing why we </v>

3114
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:53.250
<v Speaker 3>have a real flaw with this idea of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person being chief</v>

3115
02:25:53.290 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he scared the piss out of people</v>

3116
02:25:56.350 --> 02:26:01.350
<v Speaker 2>and usually a topic swings back around </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like nuclear weapons or nuclear war </v>

3117
02:26:01.350 --> 02:26:04.801
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can this one guy really go and just hit </v>

3118
02:26:04.801 --> 02:26:04.830
<v Speaker 2>the button while also the real problem?</v>

3119
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot Muniz.is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strategic.</v>

3120
02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought about reelection.</v>

3121
02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:12.110
<v Speaker 3>He filed for reelection almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately or did he really?</v>

3122
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a strategy for that too.</v>

3123
02:26:14.810 --> 02:26:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that any like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget exactly what the strategy is,</v>

3124
02:26:20.301 --> 02:26:25.301
<v Speaker 3>but it's in terms of how people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressing him and how people are </v>

3125
02:26:25.301 --> 02:26:27.170
<v Speaker 3>talking against him because they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be running for president.</v>

3126
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:32.770
<v Speaker 3>They would also be if they're running </v>
<v Speaker 3>for president because he is a </v>

3127
02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:35.171
<v Speaker 3>presidential candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like certain rules to behavior </v>

3128
02:26:35.171 --> 02:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>and this is a very calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3129
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:37.770
<v Speaker 3>chest movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very.</v>

3130
02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:42.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a big chess move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what disturbs me the most </v>

3131
02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.700
<v Speaker 3>about North Korea because there's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to ensure that people want to keep </v>

3132
02:26:46.551 --> 02:26:51.551
<v Speaker 3>the same president and that that way is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wore it like once you are in a war,</v>

3133
02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:56.860
<v Speaker 3>say if we are three plus years in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's campaigning for president again and</v>

3134
02:26:58.641 --> 02:27:03.641
<v Speaker 3>it escalates with North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That propaganda escalates the lies the </v>

3135
02:27:03.641 --> 02:27:06.020
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the fuck happens and then</v>

3136
02:27:06.021 --> 02:27:11.021
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden there's actual military </v>
<v Speaker 3>action that is going to ensure a </v>

3137
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:11.021
<v Speaker 3>reelection,</v>

3138
02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I think or would I could see that or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would flip everybody against him.</v>

3139
02:27:18.951 --> 02:27:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I could see a swing in both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>

3140
02:27:20.841 --> 02:27:23.750
<v Speaker 2>It depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how scared people aren't.</v>

3141
02:27:23.751 --> 02:27:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Depends on if we get attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we get attacked,</v>

3142
02:27:25.701 --> 02:27:30.701
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you he wins again because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to want Bernie to in </v>

3143
02:27:30.701 --> 02:27:34.271
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go there and I'm going to </v>

3144
02:27:34.271 --> 02:27:36.291
<v Speaker 2>promise them equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if we got attacked by North </v>

3145
02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3146
02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:40.790
<v Speaker 2>his escalation might be nucular in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>level and then it's.</v>

3147
02:27:40.791 --> 02:27:42.800
<v Speaker 2>We're all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're glowing in the dark.</v>

3148
02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:45.680
<v Speaker 2>If that shit works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this stuff works,</v>

3149
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I tell you what,</v>

3150
02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.470
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about a war that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would want.</v>

3151
02:27:48.471 --> 02:27:49.700
<v Speaker 2>No part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>

3152
02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy.</v>

3153
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3154
02:27:51.921 --> 02:27:55.610
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rugged terrain controlled environments.</v>

3155
02:27:55.611 --> 02:27:57.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>

3156
02:27:57.291 --> 02:28:02.291
<v Speaker 2>And they got some big old army's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>call on Elon Musk and sending the </v>

3157
02:28:02.291 --> 02:28:02.291
<v Speaker 2>drones.</v>

3158
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Those Boston dynamic drones that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do backflips get those fucking new </v>

3159
02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:12.101
<v Speaker 2>robots that they have to tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now the drones are carrying the </v>

3160
02:28:12.101 --> 02:28:12.101
<v Speaker 2>lion's share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they?</v>

3161
02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3162
02:28:13.370 --> 02:28:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people realize how much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3163
02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:19.520
<v Speaker 2>they are carrying probably the lion </v>
<v Speaker 2>share of the kinetic activity throughout</v>

3164
02:28:19.521 --> 02:28:20.290
<v Speaker 2>the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

3165
02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:25.240
<v Speaker 2>they're doing as as they can with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really know like how much drone activity</v>

3166
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:28.420
<v Speaker 2>things going on that we don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't know about.</v>

3167
02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I have absolutely no idea but about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to imagine that it is.</v>

3168
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I would have to imagine that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial.</v>

3169
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less risk from a risk to force </v>

3170
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:45.821
<v Speaker 2>perspective because if you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as you're the person who has the </v>

3171
02:28:45.821 --> 02:28:49.841
<v Speaker 2>drone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less risk because you're not </v>

3172
02:28:49.841 --> 02:28:51.550
<v Speaker 2>putting a physical human being at risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>or launching a forest or an asset or a </v>

3173
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:52.370
<v Speaker 2>helicopter that could fill in the blank </v>
<v Speaker 2>go wrong.</v>

3174
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:58.690
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other side of that risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>though is that how are you really sure </v>

3175
02:28:58.690 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 2>the person that you're going after is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3176
02:28:59.421 --> 02:29:04.421
<v Speaker 2>Are you really sure that they're alone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really sure that you can action </v>

3177
02:29:04.421 --> 02:29:04.421
<v Speaker 2>this target in a way that's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have collateral damage?</v>

3178
02:29:04.421 --> 02:29:05.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's two different tides of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3179
02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:11.470
<v Speaker 2>two different sides of the risk and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that right now at the American </v>

3180
02:29:11.470 --> 02:29:16.000
<v Speaker 2>populace would probably rather not see </v>
<v Speaker 2>flag draped coffins and just assume that</v>

3181
02:29:18.021 --> 02:29:19.220
<v Speaker 2>business is being taken care of.</v>

3182
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:26.220
<v Speaker 2>So disturbing the idea of that getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned around on us.</v>

3183
02:29:26.221 --> 02:29:31.221
<v Speaker 2>And even more disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it from that perspective </v>

3184
02:29:31.221 --> 02:29:34.101
<v Speaker 2>of somebody launched a Tomahawk missile </v>
<v Speaker 2>into downtown or not Tom Hall because </v>

3185
02:29:34.101 --> 02:29:37.511
<v Speaker 2>they're not on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far they go or j dot m or fill in </v>

3186
02:29:37.511 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>the blank in an La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China flies a drone over or whatever.</v>

3187
02:29:40.251 --> 02:29:45.251
<v Speaker 2>North Korea flies a drone over and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just juiced the US bank building in </v>

3188
02:29:45.251 --> 02:29:46.400
<v Speaker 2>downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would we respond to that?</v>

3189
02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:48.980
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3190
02:29:48.981 --> 02:29:53.981
<v Speaker 2>I sit back and I freaked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kick my.</v>

3191
02:29:54.291 --> 02:29:59.291
<v Speaker 2>I just do mental judo in my head trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what the Hell I did with </v>

3192
02:29:59.631 --> 02:30:02.900
<v Speaker 2>almost 20 years of my life and did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do anything important and where</v>

3193
02:30:02.901 --> 02:30:07.901
<v Speaker 2>whereas everything going and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was I doing for so long it</v>

3194
02:30:08.361 --> 02:30:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I struggled with it quite often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

3195
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I worry that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my biggest fear is that my children </v>

3196
02:30:17.151 --> 02:30:19.220
<v Speaker 2>would have to finish something that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

3197
02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that the success that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we had as a military drove the creation </v>

3198
02:30:26.961 --> 02:30:30.530
<v Speaker 2>of the enemy that we're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took an organization that was largely</v>

3199
02:30:30.531 --> 02:30:35.531
<v Speaker 2>geographically co located and we were so</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective at finding them when they met </v>

3200
02:30:35.531 --> 02:30:37.640
<v Speaker 2>in groups of people that they splintered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they spread apart,</v>

3201
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:43.150
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know why now it's more effective to </v>

3202
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.150
<v Speaker 2>fly a drone over as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yemen,</v>

3203
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:47.921
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea if that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's easier to have a drone over </v>

3204
02:30:47.921 --> 02:30:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Yemen than an aircraft carrier sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the coast to do something about it.</v>

3205
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So now we have a an enemy that was in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of countries that's now in 30,</v>

3206
02:30:53.901 --> 02:30:54.500
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

3207
02:30:54.501 --> 02:30:59.501
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 countries and you can't really cut </v>

3208
02:30:59.501 --> 02:30:59.501
<v Speaker 2>the head off of that snake anymore.</v>

3209
02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And I look at did I do anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made my kids lives safer to do anything </v>

3210
02:31:07.701 --> 02:31:12.701
<v Speaker 2>too major daughter's life safer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say in the moment I feel I </v>

3211
02:31:12.701 --> 02:31:14.030
<v Speaker 2>feel like I had a difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

3212
02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but I think in the grand scale of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for things,</v>

3213
02:31:18.141 --> 02:31:21.180
<v Speaker 2>looking back that everything that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with,</v>

3214
02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I almost think that the tide is washed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it away and it's very frustrating </v>

3215
02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:31.700
<v Speaker 2>because I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only able to impact the </v>

3216
02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:32.110
<v Speaker 2>battlespace that I was physically in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3217
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:33.810
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you weren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3218
02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:36.520
<v Speaker 2>so and so and I imagine for others like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't there.</v>

3219
02:31:36.570 --> 02:31:40.200
<v Speaker 2>The role that we played I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely essential and looking back on</v>

3220
02:31:40.201 --> 02:31:45.201
<v Speaker 2>my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the role of what I did was to </v>

3221
02:31:45.201 --> 02:31:47.961
<v Speaker 2>create space and a barrier and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundary so people in this country can </v>

3222
02:31:47.961 --> 02:31:51.900
<v Speaker 2>be complete cunts and complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their rights and freedoms and oppression</v>

3223
02:31:51.901 --> 02:31:52.730
<v Speaker 2>and inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

3224
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:56.610
<v Speaker 2>We have to create an environment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things can thrive and flourish and</v>

3225
02:31:56.611 --> 02:32:00.150
<v Speaker 2>be in a melting pot and figure out who </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are so we have to have that role,</v>

3226
02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:05.810
<v Speaker 2>but I just would frustrates me is seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the country or in </v>

3227
02:32:05.810 --> 02:32:10.581
<v Speaker 2>seeing what's going on in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that I was involved in </v>

3228
02:32:10.581 --> 02:32:11.310
<v Speaker 2>something that was important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just realizing all I was was a point</v>

3229
02:32:11.311 --> 02:32:16.311
<v Speaker 2>in time is sticking my finger in the dam</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had 15 different water spouts </v>

3230
02:32:16.311 --> 02:32:18.060
<v Speaker 2>coming out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't have a total solution,</v>

3231
02:32:18.061 --> 02:32:20.670
<v Speaker 2>but you certainly mitigated the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We admitted a good problem,</v>

3232
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>only been in that moment in time and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't there to mitigate it in that</v>

3233
02:32:25.201 --> 02:32:30.201
<v Speaker 2>moment in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows how much it could have </v>

3234
02:32:30.201 --> 02:32:30.201
<v Speaker 2>escalated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

3235
02:32:30.201 --> 02:32:33.350
<v Speaker 2>but who knows if the time that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there mitigated the problem or the </v>

3236
02:32:33.350 --> 02:32:38.220
<v Speaker 2>football down the road and made it worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a problem that your kids are </v>

3237
02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:39.150
<v Speaker 2>mine are going to have to solve in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future and I don't know those answers.</v>

3238
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>

3239
02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I was 100 percent and still am 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent committed and very proud of the </v>

3240
02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:49.941
<v Speaker 2>actions that I took because at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the day I made the decisions of my </v>

3241
02:32:49.941 --> 02:32:53.511
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to where I'm super lucky and </v>

3242
02:32:53.511 --> 02:32:55.701
<v Speaker 2>privileged where the American flag on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform and I got to be the example and </v>

3243
02:32:55.701 --> 02:32:57.690
<v Speaker 2>the beacon of what I wanted the US to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

3244
02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Every time that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've encountered people didn't </v>

3245
02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:02.960
<v Speaker 2>know what the US was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd never seen an American before and</v>

3246
02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:07.641
<v Speaker 2>how I acted was the u s to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was important and I'm </v>

3247
02:33:07.641 --> 02:33:11.091
<v Speaker 2>proud of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just hope at the end of the day I </v>

3248
02:33:11.091 --> 02:33:11.091
<v Speaker 2>made a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3249
02:33:11.091 --> 02:33:13.620
<v Speaker 2>instead of trying to run up hill on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>soft sand berm and go nowhere.</v>

3250
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>military action too?</v>

3251
02:33:16.051 --> 02:33:18.930
<v Speaker 2>So you don't really know what the result</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ultimately going to be.</v>

3252
02:33:18.930 --> 02:33:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody hopes in urine,</v>

3253
02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two sides,</v>

3254
02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:23.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

3255
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:28.190
<v Speaker 2>They both hope that they win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know what the fuck the </v>

3256
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:31.160
<v Speaker 2>results can be and it's not a difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>in commitment on either one of those </v>

3257
02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:34.431
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People need to understand that as well </v>

3258
02:33:34.431 --> 02:33:36.201
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I was more committed than </v>

3259
02:33:36.201 --> 02:33:37.290
<v Speaker 2>the people that we were engaging with in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with on a battlefield or anywhere in the</v>

3260
02:33:37.291 --> 02:33:39.180
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a difference of opinion.</v>

3261
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:44.270
<v Speaker 2>They believe what they believe just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as you and I believe what we </v>

3262
02:33:44.270 --> 02:33:46.600
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the issue may be and who.</v>

3263
02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3264
02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say who's right.</v>

3265
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did the best that I could do to </v>

3266
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>try to fight for what it is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed in and I don't know,</v>

3267
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it's tough at the end of the day to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and think and be like,</v>

3268
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:59.160
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do with my time.</v>

3269
02:33:59.370 --> 02:34:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a,</v>

3270
02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:08.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a daunting feeling to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's never going to be a time where </v>

3271
02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:10.590
<v Speaker 2>we really are a peace worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we ever will be,</v>

3272
02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't think we ever have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

3273
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we ever have been either.</v>

3274
02:34:15.331 --> 02:34:17.480
<v Speaker 2>But do you think we ever would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were to,</v>

3275
02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>were attacked.</v>

3276
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:19.480
<v Speaker 3>You remember that last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3277
02:34:19.810 --> 02:34:22.090
<v Speaker 3>one of the Reagan's speeches were talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3278
02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:23.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how quickly we would put our differences</v>

3279
02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:26.410
<v Speaker 3>aside if we were attacked by an alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>force from another world.</v>

3280
02:34:27.130 --> 02:34:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it would change some things </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of</v>

3281
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:33.870
<v Speaker 2>being local in San Diego and having or </v>
<v Speaker 2>an la the flags up if the entire world </v>

3282
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:35.320
<v Speaker 2>was challenged with something that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to come together with.</v>

3283
02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I bet you that would be that feeling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would cross probably any and all </v>

3284
02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:40.380
<v Speaker 2>borders.</v>

3285
02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:42.580
<v Speaker 3>The UFO dorks though they grabbed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought,</v>

3286
02:34:42.581 --> 02:34:45.130
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is proof proof.</v>

3287
02:34:45.131 --> 02:34:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Reagan knows Reagan knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3288
02:34:47.791 --> 02:34:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I do feel like almost like what we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about with nine slash 11,</v>

3289
02:34:51.221 --> 02:34:56.221
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that being attacked made people </v>

3290
02:34:56.221 --> 02:34:57.970
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more acceptable to each other more.</v>

3291
02:34:57.971 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 3>They felt more connected to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3292
02:35:00.251 --> 02:35:01.750
<v Speaker 3>let people in front of you on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway,</v>

3293
02:35:01.751 --> 02:35:02.380
<v Speaker 3>that kind of shit.</v>

3294
02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have your mortality in your </v>

3295
02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>life thrown in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he creates a pallet that is much</v>

3296
02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:11.100
<v Speaker 2>easier to appreciate the little things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think most people experience</v>

3297
02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:11.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3298
02:35:11.350 --> 02:35:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Is it weird for you when you spend so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much time in combat and spend so much </v>

3299
02:35:16.481 --> 02:35:21.481
<v Speaker 3>time overseas to come back and see all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that really don't know the </v>

3300
02:35:21.551 --> 02:35:26.551
<v Speaker 3>darkest side of the world currently mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have a view of what the earth is </v>

3301
02:35:27.791 --> 02:35:30.820
<v Speaker 3>in 2017 and if you live in San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all you do is,</v>

3302
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:35.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work at Silicon Valley and hanging </v>

3303
02:35:35.821 --> 02:35:36.130
<v Speaker 3>out in the tech industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that this is the world in 2017</v>

3304
02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:39.580
<v Speaker 3>because this is your world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is zero insulated look like we were</v>

3305
02:35:39.581 --> 02:35:44.581
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't really know the world until </v>

3306
02:35:44.581 --> 02:35:44.581
<v Speaker 3>you go into the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go into the forest,</v>

3307
02:35:44.581 --> 02:35:44.581
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3308
02:35:44.581 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 3>this is the world to the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Country is still.</v>

3309
02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:47.560
<v Speaker 3>The world is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3310
02:35:47.561 --> 02:35:52.561
<v Speaker 3>this is what it's really like when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have these artificial structures </v>

3311
02:35:52.561 --> 02:35:54.910
<v Speaker 3>and when you spent so much time in </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat and you come over and you see all</v>

3312
02:35:54.911 --> 02:35:59.911
<v Speaker 3>these people that are fighting over </v>
<v Speaker 3>these insignificant things and </v>

3313
02:35:59.911 --> 02:36:03.780
<v Speaker 3>squabbling about the use of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferred gender pronouns and all this </v>

3314
02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:05.950
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit that people find significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3315
02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:12.310
<v Speaker 2>It is very challenging for me to listen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the things that people feel are </v>

3316
02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:21.310
<v Speaker 2>important in the lack of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's the lack of what I </v>

3317
02:36:21.310 --> 02:36:25.541
<v Speaker 2>would consider to be perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny if you do say I did 17 years </v>

3318
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:28.400
<v Speaker 2>in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a guy does 20 years,</v>

3319
02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't spend that much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat.</v>

3320
02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you do a six month deployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working even at every night of </v>

3321
02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.210
<v Speaker 2>that six month deployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't gonna be the case,</v>

3322
02:36:38.211 --> 02:36:43.211
<v Speaker 2>so every other night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you're working 90 days of that </v>

3323
02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:46.451
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might spend 30 minutes in combat in </v>

3324
02:36:46.451 --> 02:36:46.451
<v Speaker 2>those 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply that by five,</v>

3325
02:36:46.451 --> 02:36:46.451
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

3326
02:36:46.451 --> 02:36:48.140
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine deployments in 20 years.</v>

3327
02:36:48.141 --> 02:36:53.060
<v Speaker 2>That's your total time combined in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual combat environment.</v>

3328
02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Not a theater of war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a combat environment where you're </v>

3329
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:00.611
<v Speaker 2>directly involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that time period for me changes the </v>

3330
02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:01.460
<v Speaker 2>way that I view the world.</v>

3331
02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Not only that time period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the time spent in those </v>

3332
02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:09.911
<v Speaker 2>countries in seeing what's the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>in other countries and what's the </v>

3333
02:37:09.911 --> 02:37:13.001
<v Speaker 2>standard here and when I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again I think we talked about </v>

3334
02:37:13.001 --> 02:37:13.001
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3335
02:37:13.001 --> 02:37:16.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about inequality or </v>

3336
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:20.710
<v Speaker 2>oppression here in this country and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the first to admit that there's </v>

3337
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:22.190
<v Speaker 2>inequality which is fun because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality everywhere.</v>

3338
02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:25.490
<v Speaker 2>But let's take a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective here.</v>

3339
02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:29.750
<v Speaker 2>If you are fortunate enough to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States of America,</v>

3340
02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the water that you sit down on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet over to take a shit is cleaner </v>

3341
02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:37.610
<v Speaker 2>than most of the water people on Earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have access to.</v>

3342
02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:43.240
<v Speaker 2>You go to starbucks and you may pay more</v>
<v Speaker 2>per ounce for a cup of coffee,</v>

3343
02:37:43.431 --> 02:37:48.431
<v Speaker 2>for the fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you do the gas coming out of your </v>

3344
02:37:48.431 --> 02:37:50.831
<v Speaker 2>pump going into your car that exceeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>the annual income of most people on the </v>

3345
02:37:51.741 --> 02:37:52.710
<v Speaker 2>face of the planet.</v>

3346
02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Are you living in a first world country </v>
<v Speaker 2>where instead of spending your time </v>

3347
02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:02.561
<v Speaker 2>trying to find that water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to spend your time sleeping in </v>

3348
02:38:02.561 --> 02:38:03.710
<v Speaker 2>line in front of the apple store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the new iphone to come out,</v>

3349
02:38:04.370 --> 02:38:08.270
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the balls to bitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how bad you have it.</v>

3350
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:13.870
<v Speaker 2>That to me is a super tough pill to </v>
<v Speaker 2>swallow because you want to talk about </v>

3351
02:38:13.870 --> 02:38:17.360
<v Speaker 2>oppression and suppression of freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

3352
02:38:17.361 --> 02:38:22.361
<v Speaker 2>I've seen street corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still red from lopping dudes </v>

3353
02:38:22.361 --> 02:38:25.241
<v Speaker 2>heads off because they voiced opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was counter to the opinion of the </v>

3354
02:38:25.241 --> 02:38:29.320
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will change your perspective on </v>

3355
02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:30.140
<v Speaker 2>whether or not words hurt you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3356
02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.360
<v Speaker 2>what rights actually mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll be like,</v>

3357
02:38:32.361 --> 02:38:37.361
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you say is actually really </v>

3358
02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:37.361
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3359
02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:40.150
<v Speaker 2>it's offensive to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm glad we live in a place where </v>

3360
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you can say those things.</v>

3361
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Moving on with my day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does that changed your </v>

3362
02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 2>perspective on human beings when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in those environments?</v>

3363
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think a human being actually </v>

3364
02:38:49.450 --> 02:38:51.641
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an inherent distrust of most of </v>

3365
02:38:51.641 --> 02:38:52.500
<v Speaker 2>most human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm being totally honest,</v>

3366
02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that I'm antisocial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife would say that she probably </v>

3367
02:38:57.660 --> 02:38:59.840
<v Speaker 2>wishes that I was more social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just kind of just take a step back</v>

3368
02:38:59.841 --> 02:39:04.670
<v Speaker 2>and just try to avoid interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 2>just about everybody that I encountered.</v>

3369
02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:08.180
<v Speaker 2>While I would imagine that your spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so much wider than the average person</v>

3370
02:39:08.181 --> 02:39:10.970
<v Speaker 2>spectrum in terms of the atrocities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are capable of committing,</v>

3371
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you've seen mean most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3372
02:39:13.611 --> 02:39:18.611
<v Speaker 2>You're operating in this one small </v>
<v Speaker 2>little sort of village in the spectrum </v>

3373
02:39:18.611 --> 02:39:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that most people are that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

3374
02:39:19.821 --> 02:39:22.700
<v Speaker 2>You're in this one little tiny area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've seen the full thing.</v>

3375
02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen horrible,</v>

3376
02:39:24.771 --> 02:39:25.920
<v Speaker 2>horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3377
02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:31.960
<v Speaker 2>That's got to mean there's no way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have some sort of no effect on </v>

3378
02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:33.380
<v Speaker 2>how you would approach people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3379
02:39:33.381 --> 02:39:38.381
<v Speaker 2>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It puts me in a position where I almost </v>

3380
02:39:38.381 --> 02:39:40.271
<v Speaker 2>have to sit back and I have to bite my </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongue because I don't share the </v>

3381
02:39:40.271 --> 02:39:42.980
<v Speaker 2>opinions that most people share because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if the military service that I have gave</v>

3382
02:39:42.981 --> 02:39:47.981
<v Speaker 2>me anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it gave me a different </v>

3383
02:39:47.981 --> 02:39:50.111
<v Speaker 2>perspective on the world and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I traveled to more of it than I </v>

3384
02:39:50.111 --> 02:39:52.460
<v Speaker 2>think most people get the chance to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got to see more of it.</v>

3385
02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Not Through my phone and my instagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>

3386
02:39:55.850 --> 02:40:00.850
<v Speaker 2>but through my own eyes and that all it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really did is just changed my value </v>

3387
02:40:00.850 --> 02:40:03.500
<v Speaker 2>perspective of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the little things.</v>

3388
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3389
02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:06.170
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it,</v>

3390
02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:11.290
<v Speaker 2>it makes it hard sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was there like a single or any </v>

3391
02:40:11.290 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 2>significant moments that you can recall </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shifted the way you</v>

3392
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:19.040
<v Speaker 1>think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what perspective?</v>

3393
02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Just knowing the people capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit.</v>

3394
02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the times they got me the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that is where you would see adults </v>

3395
02:40:30.890 --> 02:40:33.230
<v Speaker 2>talking kids into becoming suicide </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombers.</v>

3396
02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Just the evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil motherfucker who instead of having </v>

3397
02:40:38.631 --> 02:40:43.631
<v Speaker 2>the stones to come and face you will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to talk some innocent kid and </v>

3398
02:40:43.631 --> 02:40:47.171
<v Speaker 2>strapping on a suicide vest or a suicide</v>
<v Speaker 2>belt and walk into a crowd and clack it </v>

3399
02:40:47.331 --> 02:40:48.080
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

3400
02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:53.440
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the most insidious type of evil </v>

3401
02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:53.440
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

3402
02:40:54.430 --> 02:40:57.070
<v Speaker 2>they're not willing to actually engage </v>
<v Speaker 2>in themselves.</v>

3403
02:40:57.071 --> 02:41:02.071
<v Speaker 2>They want to prey on victims and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's if I have anything I hate in the </v>

3404
02:41:02.071 --> 02:41:05.041
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's the victimization of </v>

3405
02:41:05.041 --> 02:41:06.811
<v Speaker 2>innocent people watching that and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that forever throws a different </v>

3406
02:41:06.821 --> 02:41:11.821
<v Speaker 2>shade on your glasses for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just knowing that people are capable of </v>

3407
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:11.821
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

3408
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I am not surprised by any behooven human</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that I see,</v>

3409
02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:16.990
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't necessarily make me any </v>
<v Speaker 2>more prepared,</v>

3410
02:41:17.650 --> 02:41:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but I also probably in the back of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head have a different thought process </v>

3411
02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:23.380
<v Speaker 2>when I enter into situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

3412
02:41:23.381 --> 02:41:23.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3413
02:41:23.831 --> 02:41:28.831
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get my plan to kill everybody </v>

3414
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:28.831
<v Speaker 2>first and then I relax a little bit.</v>

3415
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

3416
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:30.340
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3417
02:41:30.370 --> 02:41:32.920
<v Speaker 1>who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy.</v>

3418
02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have have a plan to kill everybody in </v>

3419
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.650
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3420
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was it mcmaster's.</v>

3421
02:41:40.930 --> 02:41:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3422
02:41:41.921 --> 02:41:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it would be a be friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be courteous,</v>

3423
02:41:44.831 --> 02:41:49.831
<v Speaker 1>but have a plan to kill everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and if you're around human behavior</v>

3424
02:41:49.871 --> 02:41:51.760
<v Speaker 1>that would put people on their heels</v>

3425
02:41:51.850 --> 02:41:54.070
<v Speaker 2>and turn them white in the face long </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

3426
02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:55.630
<v Speaker 2>that is going to become your default </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

3427
02:41:55.631 --> 02:41:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you want it to be or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a violent person.</v>

3428
02:41:58.781 --> 02:42:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably the last person you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw into violence,</v>

3429
02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:05.911
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not also surprised by violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll react to it accordingly if I </v>

3430
02:42:06.071 --> 02:42:07.540
<v Speaker 2>encounter it because it doesn't surprise</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3431
02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3432
02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I would just think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3433
02:42:13.170 --> 02:42:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I've just got to believe that a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you that has experienced that </v>

3434
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:21.500
<v Speaker 1>insane level of cruelty and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your view of the world,</v>

3435
02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that you would be really intolerant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that do have this sort of narrow </v>

3436
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:31.480
<v Speaker 1>minded view of what the United States is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our,</v>

3437
02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:36.540
<v Speaker 1>our role in the world and how the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world views us and who the rest </v>

3438
02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.700
<v Speaker 1>of the world is and I'm incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciative that they live in</v>

3439
02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:43.800
<v Speaker 2>place that provides an environment for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that they can have that narrow </v>

3440
02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:47.671
<v Speaker 2>minded view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather them be that than have that </v>

3441
02:42:47.671 --> 02:42:52.101
<v Speaker 2>place not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be the biggest asshole you want </v>

3442
02:42:52.101 --> 02:42:52.101
<v Speaker 2>to and I'm going to sit back and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>grateful that,</v>

3443
02:42:52.101 --> 02:42:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that place on earth</v>

3444
02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:55.180
<v Speaker 1>for you to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3445
02:42:55.181 --> 02:43:00.181
<v Speaker 1>and I understand the idea of the non </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventionist foreign policy that if </v>

3446
02:43:00.181 --> 02:43:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd never were in these places,</v>

3447
02:43:01.601 --> 02:43:05.140
<v Speaker 1>we would never have issues and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 100 percent false.</v>

3448
02:43:05.170 --> 02:43:07.090
<v Speaker 1>This is just another way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a victim.</v>

3449
02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3450
02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:10.360
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>

3451
02:43:10.361 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if we didn't do this</v>

3452
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:14.380
<v Speaker 2>then they wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3453
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:19.530
<v Speaker 2>How about real evil does exist and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are always going to be people who want </v>

3454
02:43:19.530 --> 02:43:20.320
<v Speaker 2>to do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regardless.</v>

3455
02:43:20.321 --> 02:43:22.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're a pacifist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a Catholic,</v>

3456
02:43:22.450 --> 02:43:27.450
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will have your access somewhere on </v>

3457
02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:27.450
<v Speaker 2>earth and they're coming for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3458
02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:32.191
<v Speaker 2>it's also those parts of the world in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular are so ancient and people </v>

3459
02:43:32.191 --> 02:43:35.791
<v Speaker 2>have been living there for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they have the echoes of </v>

3460
02:43:35.791 --> 02:43:38.440
<v Speaker 2>the past and them so deeply embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their culture and their actions.</v>

3461
02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about parts of the world </v>

3462
02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:46.081
<v Speaker 2>that really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had people living there for </v>

3463
02:43:46.081 --> 02:43:46.081
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>6,000</v>

3464
02:43:46.081 --> 02:43:48.601
<v Speaker 2>years and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient barbaric instincts of those </v>

3465
02:43:49.661 --> 02:43:54.661
<v Speaker 2>people just have got to be those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those echoes have got to be sort of </v>

3466
02:43:54.761 --> 02:43:58.720
<v Speaker 2>reverberating through those cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are very interesting.</v>

3467
02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the biggest difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences that I saw between Iraq and </v>

3468
02:44:04.271 --> 02:44:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know a couple actually no def,</v>

3469
02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:13.980
<v Speaker 2>definitely those two countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East is that there's just a </v>

3470
02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:13.980
<v Speaker 2>different appreciation for life.</v>

3471
02:44:14.350 --> 02:44:19.350
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less of a value of life because </v>

3472
02:44:19.350 --> 02:44:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I think they almost find or expect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to just end sooner.</v>

3473
02:44:22.271 --> 02:44:26.920
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different culturally and yeah,</v>

3474
02:44:26.921 --> 02:44:31.921
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that oil in water will </v>

3475
02:44:31.921 --> 02:44:34.861
<v Speaker 2>mix or if ever can mix or we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a third party that acts as </v>

3476
02:44:34.861 --> 02:44:36.280
<v Speaker 2>something in between that allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>gel or man,</v>

3477
02:44:36.310 --> 02:44:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3478
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a solution for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

3479
02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:43.210
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at like how long there</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been conflict in the Middle East,</v>

3480
02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.180
<v Speaker 2>it almost seems like an insurmountable </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

3481
02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.790
<v Speaker 2>There's been conflict with man since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of man,</v>

3482
02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:50.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3483
02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:52.870
<v Speaker 2>and so I say I think we're in a forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>war right now.</v>

3484
02:44:53.170 --> 02:44:55.360
<v Speaker 2>We probably were in a forever war before</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

3485
02:44:55.361 --> 02:45:00.361
<v Speaker 2>I think the face of warfare has changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the way and the access to </v>

3486
02:45:00.361 --> 02:45:01.480
<v Speaker 2>information about that has drastically </v>
<v Speaker 2>increased,</v>

3487
02:45:01.481 --> 02:45:03.100
<v Speaker 2>was changes people's perception about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3488
02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:03.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3489
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Like we're always involved in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a conflict,</v>

3490
02:45:06.071 --> 02:45:11.071
<v Speaker 2>but we think of as a war is when we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>our troops over there are citizens over </v>

3491
02:45:13.391 --> 02:45:14.530
<v Speaker 2>there and listed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we said,</v>

3492
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:16.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now we're actually at war.</v>

3493
02:45:16.210 --> 02:45:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3494
02:45:17.301 --> 02:45:20.620
<v Speaker 2>And this war especially what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Afghanistan.</v>

3495
02:45:20.621 --> 02:45:22.440
<v Speaker 2>It's been going on for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3496
02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:25.720
<v Speaker 2>coming up on 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

3497
02:45:25.721 --> 02:45:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's happening over there?</v>

3498
02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we accomplishing?</v>

3499
02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:35.580
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a complete answer for that </v>

3500
02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:37.711
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that they are trying to do </v>

3501
02:45:37.711 --> 02:45:40.441
<v Speaker 2>their best to stabilize that region of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world by supporting the government </v>

3502
02:45:41.621 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 2>would be my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck just murderous,</v>

3503
02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.170
<v Speaker 2>murderous in the sense of not being able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe it properly,</v>

3504
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:52.050
<v Speaker 2>explanation of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man and Iraq is the same way.</v>

3505
02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Don't think for a second that we ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had boots off of the ground in Iraq.</v>

3506
02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just talked about a lot less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still have a presence there that </v>

3507
02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:01.510
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still have a presence in Korea.</v>

3508
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:06.990
<v Speaker 2>We still have a presence in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how long you have to stay if </v>

3509
02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to invest the time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilization,</v>

3510
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:14.020
<v Speaker 2>which the US military I would argue is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very good at those types of </v>

3511
02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:14.390
<v Speaker 2>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it,</v>

3512
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:19.990
<v Speaker 2>but you could also probably do open </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart surgery with a shovel to it </v>

3513
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:19.990
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily mean it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the cleanest.</v>

3514
02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.420
<v Speaker 2>So you should probably have a military </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you should probably have some </v>

3515
02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:26.670
<v Speaker 2>sort of fix up crew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3516
02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they try to do that with </v>

3517
02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:31.840
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3518
02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:32.660
<v Speaker 2>non government organizations or other </v>
<v Speaker 2>government organizations.</v>

3519
02:46:32.661 --> 02:46:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in you know,</v>

3520
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

3521
02:46:35.901 --> 02:46:39.200
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been there for five and 6,000</v>

3522
02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:44.230
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 17 years that we've had a presence </v>

3523
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:45.850
<v Speaker 2>there and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to me later sun when it's at 1700.</v>

3524
02:46:47.390 --> 02:46:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the solution for it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

3525
02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3526
02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.050
<v Speaker 2>these are the things I think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The solution might be moved to a town of</v>

3527
02:46:54.051 --> 02:46:55.450
<v Speaker 2>22,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people here.</v>

3528
02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:56.540
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3529
02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It might be just disengage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do better somebody enjoy your time.</v>

3530
02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I do better with it there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's,</v>

3531
02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I'd spend an inordinate time amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time thinking about that stuff,</v>

3532
02:47:07.371 --> 02:47:11.270
<v Speaker 2>trying to make sense of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that amount of time in my life.</v>

3533
02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:16.330
<v Speaker 2>How could you not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 years of your existence on </v>

3534
02:47:16.330 --> 02:47:16.330
<v Speaker 2>planet earth almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

3535
02:47:16.330 --> 02:47:16.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3536
02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And it probably would have been more if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get shot.</v>

3537
02:47:20.210 --> 02:47:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Well actually nursed it out for eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>more years after I got shot.</v>

3538
02:47:24.891 --> 02:47:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I did another deployment after I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>

3539
02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:28.740
<v Speaker 2>which was probably not the best call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3540
02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.000
<v Speaker 2>because I had some residual effects from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and almost gotten to the point where </v>

3541
02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:34.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3542
02:47:34.311 --> 02:47:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I need to call a helicopter in and come </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick me up because I'm,</v>

3543
02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm inhibiting the other people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was with.</v>

3544
02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be done.</v>

3545
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got shot in 2005,</v>

3546
02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:48.340
<v Speaker 2>so I was 27 super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super young in comparison to where I am </v>

3547
02:47:50.571 --> 02:47:54.410
<v Speaker 2>now at a place I wanted to be operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a level that I wanted to be operating</v>

3548
02:47:54.411 --> 02:47:55.760
<v Speaker 2>at and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3549
02:47:55.761 --> 02:48:00.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm in an Indycar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do an 800 around the track and it's </v>

3550
02:48:00.761 --> 02:48:00.761
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oops,</v>

3551
02:48:00.761 --> 02:48:03.880
<v Speaker 2>just put it in reverse by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There goes the tranny down on the track </v>

3552
02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:05.370
<v Speaker 2>and just to try to rebuild that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took awhile.</v>

3553
02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:10.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up strapped it on one more time </v>

3554
02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:10.480
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3555
02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you want to go back?</v>

3556
02:48:12.171 --> 02:48:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was what.</v>

3557
02:48:13.330 --> 02:48:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was something that Sebastian</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger talked about a lot in tribe.</v>

3558
02:48:17.210 --> 02:48:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I think for me it was more I needed to.</v>

3559
02:48:21.380 --> 02:48:24.080
<v Speaker 2>I needed to do it for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3560
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:26.240
<v Speaker 2>when I got shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it scared the shit out of me.</v>

3561
02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:28.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

3562
02:48:29.130 --> 02:48:34.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of times in the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this just blind heroism and it </v>

3563
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.130
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter what's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3564
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:38.651
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to run through the hail </v>

3565
02:48:38.651 --> 02:48:38.651
<v Speaker 2>of bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3566
02:48:38.651 --> 02:48:40.691
<v Speaker 2>I was flat on my back and but when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>round hit me in my hip and by the time I</v>

3567
02:48:40.851 --> 02:48:45.851
<v Speaker 2>had hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first thought in my head was that my </v>

3568
02:48:45.851 --> 02:48:48.131
<v Speaker 2>femur had just been shattered and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bleed to death in the space of </v>

3569
02:48:48.131 --> 02:48:52.241
<v Speaker 2>your hamstring and your quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fit your entire blood volume </v>

3570
02:48:52.241 --> 02:48:52.241
<v Speaker 2>there like I'll be dead in about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

3571
02:48:52.241 --> 02:48:55.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was thinking in my head </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I hit the ground.</v>

3572
02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And then what ended up happening that </v>
<v Speaker 2>night happened.</v>

3573
02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Eight people ended up getting wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the least wounded people.</v>

3574
02:49:02.091 --> 02:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So they were flying people out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopters.</v>

3575
02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I got put into a Bradley fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicle and taken to the Green Zone in </v>

3576
02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it scared the crap out of me.</v>

3577
02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And not only did it scare the crap out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of me,</v>

3578
02:49:12.421 --> 02:49:15.510
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely crushed my confidence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ability to do my job,</v>

3579
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:20.570
<v Speaker 2>which up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that I was at the very least </v>

3580
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:24.231
<v Speaker 2>competent and capable of doing my job </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had everything was going great up </v>

3581
02:49:24.631 --> 02:49:29.631
<v Speaker 2>until that moment and then it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't and I had nothing but </v>

3582
02:49:29.631 --> 02:49:33.081
<v Speaker 2>questions and avoid that I had to pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself out of and it was probably very </v>

3583
02:49:33.090 --> 02:49:38.090
<v Speaker 2>selfish in my desire to go back and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to continue doing what I was </v>

3584
02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:43.071
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to build myself back up to a </v>

3585
02:49:43.071 --> 02:49:43.110
<v Speaker 2>point where I thought I could operate </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3586
02:49:43.111 --> 02:49:48.111
<v Speaker 2>And I remember very distinctly going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to Afghanistan in 2010 in standing </v>

3587
02:49:48.691 --> 02:49:53.691
<v Speaker 2>outside the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to go into a door on a </v>

3588
02:49:53.691 --> 02:49:53.691
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking in my head,</v>

3589
02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:58.170
<v Speaker 2>do you still have it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then going into the door and I,</v>

3590
02:49:58.171 --> 02:50:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I needed for myself to do that again </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3591
02:50:02.641 --> 02:50:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess regained for me a sense of who I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was and to regain my confidence.</v>

3592
02:50:07.980 --> 02:50:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3593
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:12.680
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you fear would happen?</v>

3594
02:50:12.681 --> 02:50:17.681
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feared that I wouldn't know who I was </v>

3595
02:50:17.681 --> 02:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>because when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the first to admit that I </v>

3596
02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:25.280
<v Speaker 2>believe I put too much weight into what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I did as opposed to who I was.</v>

3597
02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I had too much attached to being a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3598
02:50:32.810 --> 02:50:33.390
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3599
02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and I again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

3600
02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:40.300
<v Speaker 2>the problem that I see with people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle when they get out of the </v>

3601
02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:43.181
<v Speaker 2>military is if they attach too much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity to an occupation that </v>

3602
02:50:43.181 --> 02:50:46.040
<v Speaker 2>they've walked away from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really struggle most times.</v>

3603
02:50:46.041 --> 02:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Not Always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most times,</v>

3604
02:50:47.271 --> 02:50:52.271
<v Speaker 2>and those people can end up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves into some pretty bad </v>

3605
02:50:52.271 --> 02:50:54.551
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when for guys who cut out from that </v>

3606
02:50:54.551 --> 02:50:55.070
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go off the rails,</v>

3607
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:58.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck me Nag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go off the rails in a big way because we</v>

3608
02:50:58.101 --> 02:51:00.050
<v Speaker 2>have two speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have fifth gear and hold my beer.</v>

3609
02:51:00.380 --> 02:51:02.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the only two speeds that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3610
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and I thought I had lost that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a point in my life where,</v>

3611
02:51:08.301 --> 02:51:13.301
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was where I wanted to be doing what I </v>

3612
02:51:13.301 --> 02:51:13.301
<v Speaker 2>was wanting to do.</v>

3613
02:51:13.301 --> 02:51:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was doing it right and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean it.</v>

3614
02:51:15.290 --> 02:51:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going to die in 36 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>after getting shot.</v>

3615
02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I got off the stairs of an airplane in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia beach and my wife had my son in</v>

3616
02:51:24.441 --> 02:51:26.330
<v Speaker 2>a stroller and was pregnant with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

3617
02:51:26.331 --> 02:51:31.331
<v Speaker 2>my middle son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just was such a bizarre series of </v>

3618
02:51:31.331 --> 02:51:34.280
<v Speaker 2>events that happened so quickly and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went from going so fast to nowhere,</v>

3619
02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:39.580
<v Speaker 2>to having nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not understanding why I couldn't </v>

3620
02:51:39.580 --> 02:51:41.000
<v Speaker 2>train my body to get back to where I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the only job I'd had in my adult</v>

3621
02:51:41.001 --> 02:51:43.100
<v Speaker 2>life other than working for my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had too much.</v>

3622
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I had too much invested in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupational title and I think one of </v>

3623
02:51:49.011 --> 02:51:52.280
<v Speaker 2>the best things that I was able to do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my military career was to survive it and</v>

3624
02:51:52.281 --> 02:51:53.300
<v Speaker 2>get out and to move on.</v>

3625
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:56.440
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hardest things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters as well.</v>

3626
02:51:56.450 --> 02:51:59.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thing with them and may </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters boxers too.</v>

3627
02:51:59.180 --> 02:52:00.740
<v Speaker 2>They just don't know what to do when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

3628
02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become these incredible winners in </v>

3629
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:07.810
<v Speaker 2>this one avenue and then once that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

3630
02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:12.840
<v Speaker 2>they rarely achieved that same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success in anything else where they're </v>

3631
02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:17.431
<v Speaker 2>probably not thinking about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else when they're in the middle of </v>

3632
02:52:17.431 --> 02:52:20.040
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very common with people in </v>

3633
02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:20.040
<v Speaker 2>military too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3634
02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Because the job does require a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused,</v>

3635
02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:25.510
<v Speaker 2>myopic sense of drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what you need to do,</v>

3636
02:52:25.511 --> 02:52:27.730
<v Speaker 2>especially in the seal teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the team comes first,</v>

3637
02:52:27.731 --> 02:52:28.810
<v Speaker 2>team gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal gear.</v>

3638
02:52:28.811 --> 02:52:33.811
<v Speaker 2>Then take care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried more about the person to your </v>

3639
02:52:33.811 --> 02:52:33.811
<v Speaker 2>left and to the right and then worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself,</v>

3640
02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider the impacts of your actions and</v>

3641
02:52:36.191 --> 02:52:38.230
<v Speaker 2>your words on the people around you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then on yourself.</v>

3642
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:43.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very driven down into a laser like</v>

3643
02:52:43.301 --> 02:52:48.301
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's also required to survive and </v>

3644
02:52:48.301 --> 02:52:48.301
<v Speaker 2>thrive in those environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if left unchecked,</v>

3645
02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you'll end up at the end of your career </v>
<v Speaker 2>not prepared for the next phase of your </v>

3646
02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:54.280
<v Speaker 2>life and say you do 20 years in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

3647
02:52:54.281 --> 02:52:56.020
<v Speaker 2>which is what you need to do to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>retirement.</v>

3648
02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:58.020
<v Speaker 2>You joined when you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hey,</v>

3649
02:52:58.030 --> 02:52:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you're 38.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3650
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:00.850
<v Speaker 2>the average lifespan of American is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3651
02:53:00.851 --> 02:53:01.960
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>

3652
02:53:02.470 --> 02:53:04.690
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of time left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

3653
02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:08.170
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3654
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As see guys who struggle.</v>

3655
02:53:11.470 --> 02:53:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I see guys and I struggled myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

3656
02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I went through that struggle </v>

3657
02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:21.840
<v Speaker 2>while I was still in and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle allow me to lift my chin up </v>

3658
02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:24.430
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit to look around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>start thinking about the future.</v>

3659
02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:29.390
<v Speaker 2>You're a bad motherfucker and just dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's wrap this up.</v>

3660
02:53:29.391 --> 02:53:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's wrap this up right there.</v>
