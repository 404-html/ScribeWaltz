19
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>got cooked at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a good name?</v>

20
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I haven't come up with a better name for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and let's come up with right.</v>

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe by the end of the show we'll come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with something better so that,</v>

22
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your job,</v>

23
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my new title by the end of the</v>

24
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started out in Hollywood actually.</v>

25
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I moved out after college to La because</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly because growing up I was teased a</v>

26
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was massively insecure.</v>

27
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 2>And if you've got something to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood's a great place to come to</v>

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 2>came out here to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

29
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>

30
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

31
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 2>since I didn't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a lot of friends and boys</v>

32
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't really ever like me unless they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to cheat off my paper.</v>

33
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I became addicted to achieving and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

34
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>what can I be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be somebody.</v>

35
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Like if only I was somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

36
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 2>How old was I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it started,</v>

38
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 2>ten eight something like that.</v>

39
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That's when you started like wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove yourself.</v>

40
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:29.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one,</v>

41
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>not</v>

42
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 2>teasing started happening and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started to feel like I didn't</v>

43
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 2>really fit in and I needed to find a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel worth something.</v>

44
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>So overachieving kind of became my way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

45
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 2>And then at 10 I was diagnosed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and put on Prozac at 10 I</v>

46
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>know that's what we'll bookmark that</v>
<v Speaker 2>combined.</v>

47
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 2>And so from a very early age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really thought something was wrong</v>

48
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fit in.</v>

49
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to come up with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>compensatory strategies to feel worthy,</v>

50
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>to feel validated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel like I mattered.</v>

51
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I just became like straight a</v>
<v Speaker 2>student addicted to achieving,</v>

52
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>went out to college route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in Texas,</v>

53
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 2>went to northwestern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated early and was just committed</v>

54
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 2>to moving to Hollywood and working my</v>
<v Speaker 2>way up as an actor.</v>

55
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kid I was an actor.</v>

56
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I tried that for a little bit and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

57
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is way too much rejection.</v>

58
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go on the other side of the</v>

59
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>camera and pursue this career in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

60
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know what exactly I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna do.</v>

61
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going to be a producer</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

62
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>But I came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 20 years old and I applied to the</v>

63
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 2>William Morris Agency to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 2>being assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

65
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through the training</v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

66
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>which is like pushing mail carts around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did not want to do that.</v>

67
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:45.441
<v Speaker 2>So somehow I got a desk like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>early and started working for the head</v>

68
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>of TV packaging and quickly learned I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not want to be an agent.</v>

69
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Like it just didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy long hours.</v>

70
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I was treated poorly.</v>

71
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 2>It was just a hellish job and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of selling.</v>

72
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that either.</v>

73
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 2>So I left and actually went and worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the man show I did.</v>

74
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I was thought maybe I'll like</v>
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>

75
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>So first season as demand show I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

76
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also just crazy.</v>

77
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy show to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jimmy and Adam were always like</v>

78
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>super awesome to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>

79
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young girl,</v>

80
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>pa running around there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dancers were everywhere.</v>

81
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

82
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I quickly got out of production and</v>

83
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>then started in comedy development at</v>
<v Speaker 2>paramount and started scouting comedians</v>

84
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>and going to comedy clubs and finding</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I could represent and bring</v>

85
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe get deals for them.</v>

86
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And that quickly transitioned to moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>to another company where I was doing</v>

87
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 2>comedy development and then I quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell back into being an agent.</v>

88
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>So that was like my first career was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going to comedy clubs late at</v>

89
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

90
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Eddie F two I think you know was your</v>
<v Speaker 2>first client.</v>

91
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was my very first client.</v>

92
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>We still keep in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says hi.</v>

93
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>And that was like my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here I am now 24 25 working at a big</v>

94
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>agency representing clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the youngest female agent like in</v>

95
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>the department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even in the city at that time.</v>

96
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really young,</v>

97
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>got promoted really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really super young and I was dating the</v>

98
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>head of a movie studio and I was living</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing Hollywood life,</v>

99
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>like making a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the Oscars and Golden Globes,</v>

100
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 2>private jets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with celebrities.</v>

101
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I totally had it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still wasn't happy.</v>

102
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It was like I had achieved one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there had to be the next thing and</v>

103
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>then I just leave this and then it had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

104
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd get the guy,</v>

105
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I still wouldn't be happy.</v>

106
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I get the promotion still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on that constant chase and nothing</v>

107
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.731
<v Speaker 2>ever was like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about two years I did this job,</v>

108
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm still on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also taking antianxiety pills at the</v>

109
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>time and just like trying to like manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

110
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And I was one of those people that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could really look good from the outside,</v>

111
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I could seem like I had it all together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the inside was a totally different</v>

112
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like a duck on water,</v>

113
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks smooth,</v>

114
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 2>but underneath it's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what I was like.</v>

115
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people ask me about how to</v>

116
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 2>achieve all this and still like suffer</v>
<v Speaker 2>from depression.</v>

117
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>And I was a very functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed person.</v>

118
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people think if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

119
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>you just lay in bed all day and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>soap operas or something.</v>

121
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

122
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>summarize all depression.</v>

123
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Like there's different ways it shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was able to live my life,</v>

124
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>but I always felt like something was</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

125
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like I wasn't enough and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just had this heavy,</v>

126
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>heavy energy and an and nothing I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve whatever,</v>

127
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>filling that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me keep going.</v>

128
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

129
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 2>one day I was riding up in the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and I had basically a mini panic</v>

130
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

131
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got off the elevator and I just</v>

132
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>couldn't catch my breath and was looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

133
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of weird folk painting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and art in our office and I was looking</v>

134
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>at the weird photos and the one outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my desk was this woman in a negligee</v>

135
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>who is nine months pregnant in this huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>yard sale with a Ufo light shining down</v>

136
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>on her about to take her up</v>

137
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>and I'm moving again at this painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's me.</v>

138
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>How did I get you</v>

139
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.380
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

140
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I wa I went back down the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked around Beverly Hills and then</v>

141
00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 2>came back upstairs and I just wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>

142
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>All I wanted to do was quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the answer.</v>

143
00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:31.110
<v Speaker 2>It was just I could quit my job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinvent myself and start over,</v>

144
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.180
<v Speaker 2>but I needed someone to give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission.</v>

145
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And so I called my dad because my dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

146
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.490
<v Speaker 2>has always been there for me and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

147
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I really want to quit this job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I?</v>

148
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And He did a really good dad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really pissed me off at the time,</v>

149
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but it was a good dad move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to guess what he did?</v>

150
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Told you get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

151
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Said I love you but I can't make this</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision for you.</v>

152
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>That is a good dad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Get Dad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he hung up and I quit the next day</v>

154
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:07.020
<v Speaker 2>and that was the first really big risk I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever took.</v>

155
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Why did you feel you are the pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman with a Ufo about to take you off</v>

156
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>in a flying saucer that</v>

157
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Pelican fused and lost and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fit in and like chaos and it's</v>

158
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 2>all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did I get here and what has</v>

159
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>

160
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that Hollywood has so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many stories?</v>

161
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not obviously,</v>

162
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>not exactly like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many stories of people who were</v>

163
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 1>rejected and who have decided they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come here to prove something or</v>

164
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to get the love that they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they run into?</v>

165
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>They're in the business of rejection for</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

166
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>most people don't really think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people don't act.</v>

167
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you try to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to audition.</v>

168
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you audition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to audition with hundreds</v>

169
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all trying to get the same job</v>

170
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>and they treat you like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people were trying to get the same</v>

171
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest thing and people leave</v>

172
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're just devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so confused.</v>

173
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>They get nervous before the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they leave the thing and they feel</v>

174
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 1>so helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange,</v>

176
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>strange business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

177
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Really is and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so often not based on talent.</v>

178
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so often not based on who's the</v>

179
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 2>best person for the job and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated me as an agent.</v>

180
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And also one of the reasons I left the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a deal that I put together,</v>

181
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.560
<v Speaker 2>he was actually involved in it and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss made me attach a show runner who</v>

182
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 2>like nobody wanted and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he needed the police,</v>

183
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 2>that client and it killed the show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it killed these guys.</v>

184
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 2>The opportunity</v>

185
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time in the US.</v>

186
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.850
<v Speaker 1>When I took over the man show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a showrunner that there's</v>

187
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.180
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird incestuous sort of fucking</v>

188
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:41.310
<v Speaker 1>business in Hollywood of connecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

189
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.290
<v Speaker 1>It's almost more about being social than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about anything else.</v>

190
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's about making these relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like politics.</v>

191
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>You become beholden to these people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get them jobs and they get you jobs</v>

192
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>and you all just feed off of each and</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all suck.</v>

193
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>It really happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens a lot with comedy writers.</v>

194
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of comedy writers that are</v>

195
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might've even been on Seinfeld or</v>

197
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a great show and there's a few</v>

198
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>brilliant writers and there's a few that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

199
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this guy doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>his agent is this guy's agent and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's agent force this guy in.</v>

201
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>If you get that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this guy too.</v>

202
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And they make these deals.</v>

203
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what was so frustrating for</v>

204
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>me is I'd have these really talented</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and I couldn't,</v>

205
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get them jobs.</v>

206
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Why did they put you on Prozac at 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>

207
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Were you an only child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

208
00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:30.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

209
00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I was the oldest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the oldest.</v>

210
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>How many kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to,</v>

211
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.090
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents loved me a lot and they just</v>

213
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:40.430
<v Speaker 2>were doing the best they could and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were listening to doctors.</v>

214
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:41.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a time when,</v>

215
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:44.010
<v Speaker 2>if a doctor tells you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you listen,</v>

216
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.430
<v Speaker 1>what was bombing you out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you,</v>

217
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.840
<v Speaker 1>like what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it the point where they were</v>

218
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:49.460
<v Speaker 1>willing to put you on medication?</v>

219
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I went from,</v>

220
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:55.951
<v Speaker 2>when I was little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really outgoing and talkative and</v>

221
00:09:56.111 --> 00:10:00.010
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the teasing and bullying</v>

222
00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:02.890
<v Speaker 2>started to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely just shut down.</v>

223
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I shut off a particular group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that did it to one girl and then</v>

224
00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it like kind of bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she's the one I wanted to mention</v>

225
00:10:09.761 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 2>when I won my Oscar that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

226
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to get up there and say this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is right.</v>

227
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.080
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually I got over that.</v>

228
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

229
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I really just shut down and withdrew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

230
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you move to a different school or</v>

231
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>was it just one particular kid?</v>

232
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.100
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents were like,</v>

233
00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 2>go to a different school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>

234
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

235
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>And I just wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

236
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I was stubborn and I wanted to stay and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was just scared,</v>

237
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

238
00:10:33.731 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes what we know that's,</v>

239
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.380
<v Speaker 2>that's bad is safer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel safer than what we don't know that</v>

240
00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:44.410
<v Speaker 2>might be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a comfort zone and where I was</v>

241
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I wasn't really happy,</v>

242
00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:47.620
<v Speaker 2>like I knew that school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>

243
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I was afraid that if I went to new</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

244
00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I would just have to deal with the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

245
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stay where I am.</v>

246
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that you could run into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong person when you're 10 years</v>

247
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>old and it can fuck you up for a decade</v>
<v Speaker 1>or two?</v>

248
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

249
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>But I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

250
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any human who hasn't had</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in childhood or adulthood or</v>

251
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can call bad jamie.</v>

252
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.140
<v Speaker 2>We'll get them perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever went wrong.</v>

253
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever gone wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wait.</v>

254
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 2>It's coming in too</v>

255
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>smooth and calm young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's collected.</v>

256
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

257
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:21.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody's had difficulties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

258
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.220
<v Speaker 1>it's unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the w the,</v>

259
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.910
<v Speaker 1>the bullying thing is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

260
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange how prevalent it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it seems to be a part of human</v>

261
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:35.211
<v Speaker 1>nature that people have some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to find someone who's weak or</v>

262
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:40.911
<v Speaker 1>who's insecure or who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then literally go after them and put</v>

263
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>yourself in front of them and fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and,</v>

264
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and ruin their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

265
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go get her.</v>

266
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird natural pattern that human</v>

267
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>beings follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always wondered like,</v>

268
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk to Gad sad about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the evolutionary basis for</v>

269
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it about people that makes</v>

270
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>them want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially young people.</v>

271
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:06.110
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's different with the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls do it in the way boys do it.</v>

273
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.460
<v Speaker 2>How do girls do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girls?</v>

274
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more sneaky and I think a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of times it's based more on jealousy</v>

275
00:12:11.511 --> 00:12:13.520
<v Speaker 2>and that might have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

276
00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:16.190
<v Speaker 2>that might have some unattractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

277
00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

278
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smart.</v>

279
00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:21.410
<v Speaker 2>School came easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The teachers really like me.</v>

280
00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Parents liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that might have had</v>

281
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.000
<v Speaker 2>something to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

282
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.450
<v Speaker 2>it's 10 like I have no idea why they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did,</v>

284
00:12:29.451 --> 00:12:33.620
<v Speaker 2>but it was more sneaky like passing</v>
<v Speaker 2>around notes saying I joined the,</v>

285
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I hate Christine club and like having</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone sign it and,</v>

286
00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 2>and just kind of quietly doing it behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>my back and,</v>

287
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.030
<v Speaker 2>and pulling all my friends away where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think boys are just more aggressive.</v>

288
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll beat you up,</v>

289
00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>they'll put you in lockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that,</v>

290
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.730
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's just a,</v>

291
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.230
<v Speaker 2>a power thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within every bully as a scared little</v>

292
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:56.210
<v Speaker 2>boy or little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

293
00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I think how we're always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>

294
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:01.370
<v Speaker 2>but so much of the time we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>compensate for something,</v>

295
00:13:01.371 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we feel less than where we feel</v>

296
00:13:03.201 --> 00:13:05.660
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think if we can just have power over</v>

297
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:08.140
<v Speaker 2>something or somebody else that's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>make us feel better.</v>

298
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>There's also a thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

299
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I hate Christine Club thing where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other girls were probably like,</v>

300
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be on the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to join in.</v>

301
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

302
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>you get scared that they're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you next and you want to be on the</v>

303
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>mean team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's going on with</v>

304
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

305
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are with him and,</v>

306
00:13:28.071 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for him,</v>

307
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so vindictive and mean and he,</v>

308
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>the way he goes after people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you see a lot of people support</v>

309
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>him and sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cower to him.</v>

310
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even that Megan Kelly chick who's a</v>

311
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 1>super brassy Badass ice princess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did that interview with him after</v>

312
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they had their little thing when she sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with them and she was,</v>

313
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 1>she was so like submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was weird.</v>

314
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:54.221
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

315
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should try to keep her job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Fox News,</v>

316
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the riot act,</v>

317
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was really bizarre to watch her</v>

318
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>tone down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see it,</v>

319
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.090
<v Speaker 2>see the followup interviews this year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't call him out on anything.</v>

320
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just not really,</v>

321
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was really submissive.</v>

322
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:09.811
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

323
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 1>it was not what I expected it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very orchestrated.</v>

324
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was kind of obvious at that</v>

325
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:15.780
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he had,</v>

326
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.500
<v Speaker 1>he was the nominee or he was on his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like all the other nominees</v>

327
00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:20.640
<v Speaker 1>were falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did this interview with her and him</v>

329
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:29.100
<v Speaker 1>sat in some office room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sat across from a table and it was</v>

330
00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:29.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

331
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>people are scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

332
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.700
<v Speaker 1>People scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

333
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

334
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.640
<v Speaker 1>the strong man or the strong woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:35.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

336
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the person who's going to go after you</v>

337
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.980
<v Speaker 2>or the unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think Donald is so unpredictable.</v>

338
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.840
<v Speaker 2>You never know what he's going to throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you.</v>

339
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

340
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.020
<v Speaker 2>He will go to whatever length he needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to,</v>

341
00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:49.020
<v Speaker 2>to humiliate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make you feel less than to,</v>

342
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>to throw you off your game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

343
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so probably was just like,</v>

344
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I better just,</v>

345
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:54.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

346
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.220
<v Speaker 1>he sues so many people and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sue him.</v>

347
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his world,</v>

348
00:14:58.930 --> 00:14:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

349
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that's like a normal thing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't have a bunch of lawsuits</v>

350
00:15:02.261 --> 00:15:05.410
<v Speaker 1>floating around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably feels like nothing is even</v>

351
00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

352
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.510
<v Speaker 1>they're going to got to get something</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

353
00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I got to sue somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

354
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

355
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.890
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are attracted to him because they</v>

356
00:15:14.891 --> 00:15:17.590
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be on his bad side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are terrified of him,</v>

357
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super billionaire,</v>

358
00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:19.690
<v Speaker 1>very famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

359
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>powerful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

360
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:25.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people that,</v>

361
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with this,</v>

362
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I hate Christine Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was this one mean bitch.</v>

363
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just wanted to go after you.</v>

364
00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to side with her just because</v>

365
00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:39.370
<v Speaker 1>they're scared that she's going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and start going after them next.</v>

366
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

367
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:41.854
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

368
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

369
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a tribal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

370
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Becomes this weird like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's our leader now.</v>

371
00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of leaders are the most vicious,</v>

373
00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty,</v>

374
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>terrifying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

375
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:57.400
<v Speaker 1>look at the dictators in Russia or Putin</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Kim Jong.</v>

376
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what are they known for?</v>

377
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.160
<v Speaker 1>The dictators and a lot of these Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern countries,</v>

378
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.590
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless people yet.</v>

379
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's scared of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all go behind them,</v>

380
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

381
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better to be behind them.</v>

382
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Then you go up against them to feel the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrath.</v>

383
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.441
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

384
00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I think fear is a big motivator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

385
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it I think impacts our ability to</v>

386
00:16:18.221 --> 00:16:22.840
<v Speaker 2>really think clearly about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're just so scared and so</v>

387
00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:26.080
<v Speaker 2>threatened that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stopped questioning,</v>

388
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.580
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is he really saying?</v>

389
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:29.370
<v Speaker 2>What does he really leading me to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

390
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the thing with Donald and I</v>

391
00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>talked to people who support him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

392
00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:34.054
<v Speaker 2>but do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

393
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 2>do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he would have more money if he</v>

394
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>would have just like taken the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father left him,</v>

395
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.240
<v Speaker 2>invested it versus all the bankrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done.</v>

396
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the keys,</v>

397
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.040
<v Speaker 2>there's just so much that doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense about him yet.</v>

398
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

399
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.873
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

400
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a man alive that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs mushrooms more than Donald Trump</v>

401
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

402
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

403
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there probably has been,</v>

404
00:16:57.131 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 1>but he needs him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he needs to go straight to the</v>

405
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

406
00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you might need to go right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he needs something.</v>

407
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just he's,</v>

408
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he's almost like the super impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>hubris character.</v>

409
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

410
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 1>everything is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Hillary Clinton says,</v>

411
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't pay taxes because she goes,</v>

412
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he can't help.</v>

413
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you're on the deer out of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate on TV.</v>

414
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you're smart because you don't</v>

415
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:21.760
<v Speaker 1>pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

416
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.321
<v Speaker 2>Me Reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected me.</v>

417
00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not just him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

418
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:28.150
<v Speaker 2>it really reflects like where we are as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society,</v>

419
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:32.560
<v Speaker 2>that enough people support him to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to the place that he is.</v>

420
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I think we're so polarized right now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

421
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:36.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really love either candidate,</v>

422
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.200
<v Speaker 2>to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

423
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.710
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that maybe this is just wishful</v>

424
00:17:41.711 --> 00:17:44.140
<v Speaker 2>thinking that we'll have four years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is.</v>

425
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the next election we'll have</v>

426
00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>people that we're actually excited about</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting and voting for.</v>

427
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.180
<v Speaker 1>That may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see those people anywhere.</v>

428
00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we want for the job?</v>

429
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What one wants the job.</v>

430
00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:00.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy job and it's a job where</v>

431
00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:03.520
<v Speaker 1>the just try to destroy you if you run</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

432
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're seeing that with,</v>

433
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.950
<v Speaker 1>with trump and you're seeing that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary and they're pulling out all the</v>

434
00:18:08.951 --> 00:18:13.390
<v Speaker 1>stops and by the time it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of the commander in chief,</v>

435
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.420
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be terrible no matter who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>

436
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

437
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that crooked hillary thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stick forever.</v>

438
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Crooked Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stick forever.</v>

439
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And People's opinion of him is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

440
00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:28.810
<v Speaker 1>It's no matter who wins and she's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win,</v>

441
00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:31.690
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not good.</v>

442
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

443
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't represent what we think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States says we think of the</v>

444
00:18:37.511 --> 00:18:42.370
<v Speaker 1>United States is being this unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 1>place of creativity and innovation and</v>

445
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the greatest super power of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever known.</v>

446
00:18:44.711 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:50.380
<v Speaker 1>it's really progressive force for good</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

448
00:18:50.381 --> 00:18:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

449
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we need to go through this time</v>

450
00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:58.730
<v Speaker 2>though to shake it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe things need to get bad to get</v>

451
00:18:58.731 --> 00:18:59.410
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

452
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.780
<v Speaker 2>and I see that in human psychology so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much do you need,</v>

453
00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you need to hit rock bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to go through these hard times</v>

454
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.600
<v Speaker 2>to have something better emerge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's just wishful thinking.</v>

455
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably right.</v>

456
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we also needed to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the wiki leaks,</v>

457
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations,</v>

458
00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:19.030
<v Speaker 1>like how exactly politics is run even</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people we think that are the</v>

459
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:22.390
<v Speaker 1>good folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all fucking gross and dirty</v>

460
00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 1>and all the stuff with the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundation and all the stuff they did to</v>

461
00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Bernie sanders and they conspired to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that guy out.</v>

462
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:29.531
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

463
00:19:29.531 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a Democrat too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are whole,</v>

464
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was supposed to be about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the person that best represents</v>

465
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:41.341
<v Speaker 1>the people with the people choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now the Democratic National</v>

466
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Committee was fucking working to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that Bernie Sanders wasn't the guy.</v>

467
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were all conspiring with</v>

468
00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and they're all pulling favors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like we were talking about</v>

469
00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:54.160
<v Speaker 1>before with producers and networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit.</v>

470
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just using your power and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and all the friends that</v>

471
00:19:57.701 --> 00:20:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you've made in all the years and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>favors and pulling it together.</v>

472
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But now we're being exposed to it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we haven't really,</v>

473
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:08.590
<v Speaker 1>since Watergate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watergate gave us like a little window,</v>

474
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:11.830
<v Speaker 1>a tiny little window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the access to information was so</v>

475
00:20:11.831 --> 00:20:15.730
<v Speaker 1>minuscule back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we clung to those 15 minutes of</v>

476
00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:17.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watergate tapes,</v>

477
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:19.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>

478
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.020
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

479
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a crook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

480
00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:25.190
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing what they were all doing.</v>

481
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.030
<v Speaker 1>He just got caught and we got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a sense of it now.</v>

482
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:31.630
<v Speaker 1>But now when you read these emails about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they really feel about each other</v>

483
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:34.150
<v Speaker 1>and all the fucking gross nist that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and</v>

484
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to not engage too much in the</v>

485
00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 2>gross ness cause it's just like what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point?</v>

486
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Guess the point is to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world really is about.</v>

487
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.430
<v Speaker 1>What the structure of government that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looms over us is really all about.</v>

488
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Why are certain things legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why a certain things illegal,</v>

489
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>why are certain loopholes in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they get in place?</v>

490
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a charity?</v>

491
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And if it is a charity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you get paid so much?</v>

492
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how come you get paid $250,000 to</v>

493
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 1>speak and then all this money goes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your charity.</v>

494
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 1>But that $250,000 goes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just talked for an hour.</v>

495
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a scam.</v>

496
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're asking,</v>

497
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you're being curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being curious,</v>

498
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you're asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's helpful.</v>

499
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I think what so many people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just getting mad and just trash</v>

500
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>talking America and the the candidates</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

501
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't do any good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

502
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>If you want to like ask questions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get involved and start to get curious</v>

503
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and quest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

504
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.370
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we change things.</v>

505
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 2>But I think too much of this has just</v>
<v Speaker 2>been so emotionally driven that people</v>

506
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 2>are just getting upset and not really</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

507
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>

508
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 2>What can I learn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I shift this in some way?</v>

509
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also people are like super psyched</v>

510
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:53.010
<v Speaker 1>to get behind their candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their team.</v>

511
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross this on both sides for sure.</v>

512
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of gross on the trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

513
00:22:00.271 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of mean assholes that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally found another mean asshole</v>

514
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that's run for president and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped like he's one of them.</v>

515
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.080
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a lot of men who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>using Hashtag I'm with her and they're</v>

516
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the grossest little fucking white</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>

517
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've run across a few of them on</v>

518
00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:19.680
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the White Knight.</v>

519
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what a white knight is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

520
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 1>You really don't know like a knight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>shining armor.</v>

521
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man comes along,</v>

522
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it comes along and positions himself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superior morally superior to call</v>

523
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtue signaling.</v>

524
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>If someone who would would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:22:36.811 --> 00:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag I'm with her Hashtag male</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist,</v>

526
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag [inaudible] that's real.</v>

527
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

528
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying hard.</v>

529
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.840
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't get laid in the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

530
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.500
<v Speaker 1>this is the strategy there was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy is to position themselves as</v>

531
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the super progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

532
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who don't want you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that they're racist,</v>

533
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 1>so they go out of their way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against white people,</v>

534
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.230
<v Speaker 1>other white people when they're white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing with this woman was</v>

535
00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:06.630
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a white person and you were</v>

536
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 1>up for a job and you are up against a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person of color,</v>

537
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.860
<v Speaker 1>do period not period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that job.</v>

538
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examine white privilege.</v>

539
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

540
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.180
<v Speaker 1>what Liberal Arts College do you belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>

541
00:23:21.181 --> 00:23:24.750
<v Speaker 1>What fucking crazy shit is in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

542
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do period.</v>

543
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Not Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take that job.</v>

544
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

545
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't have to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went on a tangent and went off.</v>

546
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to find out how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a life coach and all of a sudden</v>

547
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you're talking politics.</v>

548
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White Knights.</v>

549
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lockers.</v>

550
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Jets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

551
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I know a whole new understanding of</v>

552
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:48.194
<v Speaker 2>white nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

553
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I always understood it as you know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who's going to come in and</v>

554
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 2>rescue,</v>

555
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.280
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're positioning themselves as</v>

556
00:23:53.281 --> 00:23:53.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

557
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a couple decades away from</v>

558
00:23:56.671 --> 00:24:00.570
<v Speaker 1>all this going away because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is going government going</v>

559
00:24:00.571 --> 00:24:02.370
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit,</v>

560
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.930
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit and lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where ups,</v>

561
00:24:04.931 --> 00:24:08.520
<v Speaker 1>so I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think technology is going to enable</v>

562
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.610
<v Speaker 1>just like no one anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

563
00:24:11.611 --> 00:24:15.360
<v Speaker 1>as you can go back to the f,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first days of cameras,</v>

564
00:24:15.361 --> 00:24:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if you went to act in the 18 hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they first had a camera,</v>

565
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would have ever thought did in</v>

566
00:24:20.491 --> 00:24:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the lifespan of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what was the first camera,</v>

567
00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 1860 something like that.</v>

568
00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Like civil war era was like the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>

569
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.620
<v Speaker 1>No one would've ever thought that in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespans,</v>

570
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From then to now,</v>

571
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you would be able to send video to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia instantaneously from something</v>

572
00:24:40.861 --> 00:24:44.670
<v Speaker 1>that slips into your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like stop</v>

573
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>to think about how much we've seen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lifetime.</v>

574
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're just so used to it.</v>

575
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so used to google and the</v>

576
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Hillary Clinton was a telling like</v>

577
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump said something and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

578
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google what?</v>

579
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true,</v>

580
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hilarious is that Hillary Clinton is</v>

581
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 1>telling people to Google Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

582
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how beautiful access to</v>

583
00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 1>information is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

584
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I think we are a couple of decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit more away from a</v>

585
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:18.431
<v Speaker 1>completely new paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely new way of accessing</v>

586
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to submit to</v>

587
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a neural implant or some</v>

588
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 1>sort of a augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to be able to read</v>

589
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 1>intention and thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be,</v>

590
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to be any lying and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years.</v>

591
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.883
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

592
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Totally think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why we're seeing so</v>

593
00:25:36.121 --> 00:25:39.150
<v Speaker 2>many of these systems breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the presidential election,</v>

594
00:25:39.151 --> 00:25:41.520
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to be this coveted amazing</v>

595
00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:43.680
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're kind of looking at it as like,</v>

596
00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a reality TV show.</v>

597
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seems like now.</v>

598
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It's all pussy grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness,</v>

599
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

600
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just believe that</v>

601
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.600
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 minutes in the second debate,</v>

602
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been out of the country for a</v>

603
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was so refreshing and to come back</v>

604
00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and I watched it and the first 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes was just character slams.</v>

605
00:26:04.261 --> 00:26:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing about nothing about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues or anything.</v>

606
00:26:07.861 --> 00:26:08.694
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

607
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.610
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening?</v>

608
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.820
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

609
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:15.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make me feel like if he shits</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her or she shits on him and she tears</v>

610
00:26:15.601 --> 00:26:17.640
<v Speaker 1>him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make me feel like she's</v>

611
00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:19.800
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked her in one of the debates</v>

612
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.790
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't tune into it until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last like hour and he was saying a bunch</v>

613
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:25.560
<v Speaker 1>of crazy shit and she would start</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

614
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how she should handle him.</v>

615
00:26:28.201 --> 00:26:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should handle him like he's a child.</v>

616
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if she did that,</v>

617
00:26:31.621 --> 00:26:36.621
<v Speaker 1>but she's fucking crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So change depending president.</v>

618
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Another tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of life coaching.</v>

619
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do,</v>

620
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>how do you go from,</v>

621
00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're were mad at both of us,</v>

622
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:48.354
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

623
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Shoot about poetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

624
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>How about you just shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will totally own that.</v>

625
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not my area of expertise.</v>

626
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 3>So guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows shit about politics.</v>

627
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Even the people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Donald Trump's running for</v>

628
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody saw that common.</v>

629
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody understands this stupid system.</v>

630
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But You understand life coaching or</v>

631
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>we're going to come up with a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

632
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 3>So life coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

633
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:12.620
<v Speaker 3>but so the way it happened</v>

634
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.580
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

635
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.080
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I quit my job,</v>

636
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.280
<v Speaker 4>which threw me into an even worse</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression because that was my whole</v>

637
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was my success in being an</v>

638
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:23.960
<v Speaker 4>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then in a period of,</v>

639
00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:25.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like six to eight months,</v>

640
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.950
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of things happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went into lots of debt because I tried</v>

641
00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:30.260
<v Speaker 4>to keep up with this lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

642
00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:33.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a strange for my family for a bit,</v>

643
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:35.150
<v Speaker 4>cause I made a choice that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really like.</v>

644
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 4>And I got diagnosed with another</v>
<v Speaker 4>autoimmune disorder on top of everything</v>

645
00:27:39.771 --> 00:27:41.990
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was engaged and thought,</v>

646
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.280
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a wife.</v>

647
00:27:43.281 --> 00:27:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Like that's my next role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be fine.</v>

648
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.590
<v Speaker 4>And then six months before my wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dumped me culturally.</v>

649
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.020
<v Speaker 4>So I it not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

650
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I know people listening have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>through worse,</v>

651
00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:57.530
<v Speaker 4>but in that like span at 26 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>losing my career and money and family</v>

652
00:27:57.531 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 4>and health and love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of like this sucks like</v>

653
00:28:02.031 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

654
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had honestly a moment on my</v>

655
00:28:06.921 --> 00:28:08.990
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't know why it was on my</v>

656
00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:10.160
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was disgusting,</v>

657
00:28:10.161 --> 00:28:12.410
<v Speaker 4>but she was laying there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good spot to cry.</v>

658
00:28:12.411 --> 00:28:14.450
<v Speaker 4>The tiles are nice and cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

659
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.540
<v Speaker 4>it feels very dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had this like kind of insight,</v>

660
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:27.490
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could say of how much I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>relating to everything as a total victim</v>

661
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.960
<v Speaker 4>as like everything was happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it dawned on me,</v>

662
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm the common denominator in like all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of these situations.</v>

663
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.120
<v Speaker 4>So either I have just really bad luck or</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have some influence over this.</v>

664
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was just a teeny bit of an</v>

665
00:28:44.961 --> 00:28:48.500
<v Speaker 4>insight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was enough of a new perspective</v>

666
00:28:48.501 --> 00:28:52.550
<v Speaker 4>on my life that kind of got me off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor and started to give me</v>

667
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:57.020
<v Speaker 4>some kind of hope and started to make me</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize I needed help.</v>

668
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.240
<v Speaker 4>And like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way I was doing my life wasn't going</v>

669
00:28:59.241 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 4>to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I found,</v>

670
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.280
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was having a quarter life</v>
<v Speaker 4>crisis and I found a book by that name</v>

671
00:29:07.281 --> 00:29:10.580
<v Speaker 4>and I read it and it was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't going deep enough for me.</v>

672
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.020
<v Speaker 4>So I decided to write a book about my</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and everything I was learning</v>

673
00:29:15.021 --> 00:29:18.680
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how I like was getting myself off my</v>

674
00:29:18.681 --> 00:29:19.820
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

675
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.680
<v Speaker 4>And I was interviewing people for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>book and they kept saying things to me</v>

676
00:29:24.681 --> 00:29:26.600
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I set up a session with you?</v>

677
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:27.531
<v Speaker 4>And I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

678
00:29:27.531 --> 00:29:28.880
<v Speaker 4>I got all the information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

679
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:30.530
<v Speaker 4>why aren't you a coach or a counselor or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>

680
00:29:30.531 --> 00:29:32.360
<v Speaker 4>And I'd say no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

681
00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:33.290
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>

682
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:34.130
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be.</v>

683
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.260
<v Speaker 4>And I kept hearing this over and over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

684
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 4>So I went to my coach and kind of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>first teacher who I met when I was 22</v>

685
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 4>and I was still seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she has had a major impact in my</v>

686
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

687
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:44.561
<v Speaker 4>Mona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

688
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 4>everybody's telling me I should do this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been looking for my career for</v>

689
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and maybe this is what I'm</v>

690
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 4>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

691
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>

692
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go out,</v>

693
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 4>I've been coming for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

694
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 4>why didn't you tell me this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

695
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to figure it out,</v>

696
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 4>you had to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's how it just started.</v>

697
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Like people kept reflecting back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

698
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:04.420
<v Speaker 4>you're good at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should do this.</v>

699
00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't really know how or what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then I just became,</v>

700
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.180
<v Speaker 4>I started studying it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I prentice with her,</v>

701
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 4>I got training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a master's degree,</v>

702
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I wrote more books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it just sort of happened out of my</v>

703
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 4>own life and out of just creating things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I thought would help people and</v>

704
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 4>people going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually this is really helping me and</v>

705
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 4>can I talk to you more?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

706
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good 10,</v>

707
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>11 years ago.</v>

708
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you pushed some mic forward a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more and make the sounds</v>

709
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good in your ear.</v>

710
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Just the recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be.</v>

711
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that an interesting thing that um,</v>

712
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.730
<v Speaker 1>it's oftentimes small choices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make that dictate what happens to</v>

713
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>them in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just decide that things are</v>

714
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 1>happening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't take any responsibility for</v>

715
00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 1>any of the choices.</v>

716
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.940
<v Speaker 4>That's to me the biggest difference are</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are able to change their life</v>

717
00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.190
<v Speaker 4>and people who don't is ownership is</v>
<v Speaker 4>realizing that yes,</v>

718
00:30:58.191 --> 00:31:01.910
<v Speaker 4>things happen but we're not victims and</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything can happen.</v>

719
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.890
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same exact thing happened to you and</v>

720
00:31:03.891 --> 00:31:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can make different choices about</v>

721
00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:08.570
<v Speaker 4>what we make it mean and how we respond</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it and we're going to create</v>

722
00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:12.680
<v Speaker 4>different results based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not what happens to people.</v>

723
00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:16.430
<v Speaker 4>It's not just luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's truly what are you going to choose</v>

724
00:31:16.431 --> 00:31:20.000
<v Speaker 4>to believe about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's to me the key differentiator</v>

725
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.680
<v Speaker 4>between staying where you are and kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of regressing as you get older and just</v>

726
00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:29.360
<v Speaker 4>repeating your familiar patterns and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and repeat life and more stubborn and</v>

727
00:31:29.361 --> 00:31:31.460
<v Speaker 4>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

728
00:31:31.461 --> 00:31:35.870
<v Speaker 4>just looking for those short term bursts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of happiness and like a trip or a bottle</v>

729
00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:40.871
<v Speaker 4>of wine or whatever versus like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting clear about how you can change</v>

730
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your purpose is,</v>

731
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 4>what brings you joy and like who you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really are.</v>

732
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing about life coaching to</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any,</v>

733
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:52.891
<v Speaker 1>but I mean just to forget that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that your dispensing advice</v>

734
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:57.981
<v Speaker 1>or giving out inspiration or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing things down that have affected</v>

735
00:31:58.501 --> 00:32:01.590
<v Speaker 1>and helped enhanced you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to dismiss that stuff.</v>

736
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

737
00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's nothing but right.</v>

738
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel like one of the best things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a part of a community or being a</v>

739
00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:14.310
<v Speaker 1>part of a culture is that you get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all of the things that people</v>

740
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:15.810
<v Speaker 1>have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it benefited them,</v>

741
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

742
00:32:17.371 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>the positive choices that someone has</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

743
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And you can learn and experience those</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having to go through all their</v>

744
00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:23.424
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

745
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>

746
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned from people,</v>

747
00:32:26.551 --> 00:32:30.510
<v Speaker 1>whether I've read things that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>said or listen to speeches that they've</v>

748
00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:34.260
<v Speaker 1>given about mistakes that they've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I've come across a similar moment</v>

749
00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:35.060
<v Speaker 1>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

750
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.700
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

751
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is.</v>

752
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

753
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the best tools that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have when,</v>

754
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to improving and enhancing</v>

755
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 1>your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own individual experience is</v>

756
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 1>looking at all the different shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people have done.</v>

757
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird one because people dismiss</v>

758
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>it so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

759
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dismiss it at a,</v>

760
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of Hubris and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of ego attached to it</v>

761
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 1>where they don't want to admit they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue or they don't want to admit</v>

762
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 1>they need help or they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that they need to be inspired or</v>

763
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:12.460
<v Speaker 1>they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>some sort of motivation.</v>

765
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

766
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.230
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

767
00:33:16.231 --> 00:33:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Back to that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this life that I know is comfortable.</v>

768
00:33:20.941 --> 00:33:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I may not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm so scared of uncertainty that I</v>

769
00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:29.610
<v Speaker 4>don't want to make the changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are terrified of the unknown.</v>

770
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 1>There's also a lot of fuckery of foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to life coaches and</v>

771
00:33:34.691 --> 00:33:38.470
<v Speaker 1>motivational speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of hosers like we were</v>

772
00:33:38.471 --> 00:33:40.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a couple hosers.</v>

773
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Speaker 1>We know there's hosers out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>

774
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

775
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's bad car mechanics,</v>

776
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll put a used part in your car and</v>

777
00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:52.720
<v Speaker 1>fuck you over this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bad doctors,</v>

778
00:33:52.721 --> 00:33:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there's bad everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in this world as someone</v>

779
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 1>who's half asking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

780
00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being a life coach or being</v>

781
00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:04.660
<v Speaker 1>a motivational speaker is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

782
00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:06.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get a phd to do it.</v>

783
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like prove yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Mike has opened up 15 different</v>

785
00:34:11.171 --> 00:34:12.670
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's going to show you how to do a</v>

786
00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:15.190
<v Speaker 1>business like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's a successful businessman.</v>

787
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people out there</v>

788
00:34:17.861 --> 00:34:20.470
<v Speaker 1>that are doing life coaching that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking failures.</v>

789
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

790
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:25.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not the worst thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world to be a failure because you've</v>

791
00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:29.800
<v Speaker 1>learned from those failures and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>your achievement or your contribution is</v>

792
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.820
<v Speaker 1>expressing those failures and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations from those failures and that</v>

793
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:36.100
<v Speaker 1>could help somebody else not make those</v>
<v Speaker 1>same mistakes.</v>

794
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

795
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 4>I think I've had a lot of so called</v>
<v Speaker 4>failures and mistakes.</v>

796
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you ever have one of those like</v>

797
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor moments?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like life pivot.</v>

798
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all.</v>

799
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so check on the floor,</v>

800
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.943
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

801
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

802
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

803
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always,</v>

805
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:55.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

806
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>for a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one is bombing.</v>

807
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Bombing on stage is devastating and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start thinking like,</v>

808
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

809
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you can only take so many of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombings in your life.</v>

810
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like getting beaten up.</v>

811
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You can only get beaten up so many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

812
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like your brain stops working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

813
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's that relationship breakups</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

814
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastations I think are always the best</v>

815
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.060
<v Speaker 1>for a rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

816
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And at the time they don't feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

817
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And devastations went to anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating the habs do in your life</v>

818
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:34.340
<v Speaker 1>while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like,</v>

819
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can take this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get through it and you have</v>

820
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 1>this sort of enhanced perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you also,</v>

821
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 1>we live in an amazing time where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

822
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that you should revel in other</v>

823
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 1>people's failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could like,</v>

824
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:51.771
<v Speaker 1>look what most of your failure is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in comparison to what's going on</v>

825
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:56.700
<v Speaker 1>in a million like Syria or million</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world that are</v>

826
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 1>just filled with fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Most people can't see that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see your life and your wife is all,</v>

828
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you know when your life is falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

829
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well and I think too,</v>

830
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get so kind of narcissistic and our</v>

831
00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:15.910
<v Speaker 4>problems that we forget the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective and we don't,</v>

832
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people talk about being happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time you should be.</v>

833
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.630
<v Speaker 4>And I just don't think that that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that you,</v>

834
00:36:22.631 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've grown and I through contrast</v>

835
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:25.960
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

836
00:36:25.961 --> 00:36:28.090
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I really understand happiness</v>

837
00:36:28.091 --> 00:36:31.120
<v Speaker 4>and joy because I've really understood</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and sadness.</v>

838
00:36:31.121 --> 00:36:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Like that polarity I think is such a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of what we're here for.</v>

839
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can look at,</v>

840
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 1>you read a book about different parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and what's going on.</v>

841
00:36:39.611 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're still happy,</v>

842
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.400
<v Speaker 1>have to read that book to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you.</v>

843
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably shouldn't be happy all the</v>

844
00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:47.110
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was actually,</v>

845
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was scientific America or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that that had an article</v>

846
00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:52.840
<v Speaker 1>recently saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be happy all the</v>

847
00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 1>time and you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

848
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's peaks and valleys in everything</v>

849
00:36:58.481 --> 00:36:59.060
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

850
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that I,</v>

851
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people listening that might be in</v>

852
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 4>one of those valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

853
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 4>don't try to just get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really ask,</v>

854
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

855
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.210
<v Speaker 4>what can I learn from this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my biggest thing is I stopped</v>

856
00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 4>asking why is this happening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And started asking what can I learn?</v>

857
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of painting yourself as a</v>

858
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 1>victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you paint yourself as someone who</v>

859
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>present in the moment and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

860
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

861
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out what's going on.</v>

862
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we don't,</v>

863
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times we don't have the tools</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where things like life</v>

864
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 4>coaching and personal development come</v>
<v Speaker 4>in handy is Chris,</v>

865
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 4>we can go and get those tools instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>using our old coping mechanisms by like</v>

866
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 4>being strong or overing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overworking,</v>

867
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 4>overdrinking over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

868
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:42.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping into a relationship,</v>

869
00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 4>like whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

870
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.420
<v Speaker 4>we don't really learn how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointment,</v>

871
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:49.520
<v Speaker 4>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger,</v>

872
00:37:49.521 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 4>or shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any of those things.</v>

873
00:37:50.881 --> 00:37:55.881
<v Speaker 4>And so we're kind of left to these quick</v>
<v Speaker 4>fix devices that I think that's a big</v>

874
00:37:56.101 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 4>reason addiction is such a problem is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we don't really learn how to</v>

875
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.690
<v Speaker 4>manage emotion and how to manage</v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointment.</v>

876
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.360
<v Speaker 4>And so we go for that thing that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>us feel better in the moment.</v>

877
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is we have to keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>upping the ante.</v>

878
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at first that one glass of wine does the</v>

879
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 4>trick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you need to,</v>

880
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:15.530
<v Speaker 4>then you need three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need vodka,</v>

881
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 4>whatever it may be.</v>

882
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.420
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

883
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 4>why I'm so passionate about what I do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

884
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought I could be happy.</v>

885
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Like I really didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that this,</v>

886
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

887
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I was going to be depressed and I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>was gonna constantly be looking for</v>

888
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:38.601
<v Speaker 4>something to fix me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never really truly thought this life</v>

889
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 4>that I'm living now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is possible.</v>

890
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>externally things look fine.</v>

891
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 4>But internally I'm talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different kind of experience and</v>

892
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 4>it's only because of those like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>awful moments.</v>

893
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:55.501
<v Speaker 4>I call them expectation hangovers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was kind of desperate enough to</v>

894
00:38:55.751 --> 00:39:00.751
<v Speaker 4>let go of my normal coping mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my trying to control everything.</v>

895
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 4>It was like the ultimate and surrender</v>
<v Speaker 4>truly of going okay.</v>

896
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

897
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I need to find a different way to deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this.</v>

898
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's really what has led me down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the path that,</v>

899
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 4>that I am today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

900
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.153
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

901
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that life coaching and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>personal transformation industry and all</v>

<v Speaker 3>What do you see?</v>

925
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 3>A skull?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably said things like a butterfly.</v>

926
00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I know that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate from school.</v>

927
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:14.450
<v Speaker 3>We'll fucking axe in her head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the doctor puts you on Prozac and</v>

928
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.740
<v Speaker 3>what kind of an effect does that have on</v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

929
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually helped.</v>

930
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.250
<v Speaker 4>It really helped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it helped me.</v>

931
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

932
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.410
<v Speaker 4>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to remember too.</v>

933
00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 10,</v>

934
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.930
<v Speaker 4>but when I talked to my parents about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

935
00:40:27.931 --> 00:40:28.471
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

936
00:40:28.471 --> 00:40:32.280
<v Speaker 4>it did help because I really do think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because of everything that</v>

937
00:40:32.281 --> 00:40:33.061
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

938
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:34.920
<v Speaker 4>my brain chemistry did shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

939
00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:39.450
<v Speaker 4>I do think that we can shift our brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry with repetitive thoughts and</v>

940
00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:41.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had enough thoughts about,</v>

941
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not likable.</v>

942
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.050
<v Speaker 4>I had just intense inner critic in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

943
00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:48.060
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that shifted my brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>

944
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.480
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that the medicine helped</v>
<v Speaker 4>me at least get to a point where,</v>

945
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like kind of awake again.</v>

946
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.180
<v Speaker 4>How long does on tank?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember,</v>

947
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.370
<v Speaker 4>but I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

948
00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:04.950
<v Speaker 4>especially in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm still on it.</v>

949
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on it until 30.</v>

950
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on every,</v>

951
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 4>from every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on Prozac.</v>

952
00:41:11.281 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Welbutrin yeah.</v>

953
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years 20 from the time you were 10 so</v>

954
00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 3>all through high school you run that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

955
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

956
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.571
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

957
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I believed that I needed it just like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>diabetic would take insulin.</v>

958
00:41:23.901 --> 00:41:27.950
<v Speaker 4>So how long ago did you get off of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A seven and a half years ago.</v>

959
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.111
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

960
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally,</v>

961
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never have any regression or dips,</v>

962
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 4>but I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was super intentional about getting</v>

963
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 4>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't just stop like,</v>

964
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 4>especially after 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took me a while.</v>

965
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 4>It took a lot of the emotional work that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing with my coach Mona,</v>

966
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 4>because he know so much of depression is</v>
<v Speaker 4>suppression,</v>

967
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.261
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

968
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

969
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 4>I think I was pretty angry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had no outlet for that.</v>

970
00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Especially as a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like boys again can go out and get stuff</v>

971
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:00.620
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times,</v>

972
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 4>and this is why I think so many women</v>
<v Speaker 4>get irritable and bitchy and all those</v>

973
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 4>kinds of things is because women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have like that outlet for</v>

974
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 4>anger.</v>

975
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 4>And so we internalize a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we can do sadness but anger a lot</v>

976
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:17.201
<v Speaker 4>of times get suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of like me getting off my</v>

977
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 4>medicine and not feeling depressed was</v>
<v Speaker 4>not being suppressed by exercise.</v>

978
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 4>The exercise is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but until you like go back and actually</v>

979
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 4>process the emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean exercise is good in terms of</v>

980
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 4>moving the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times you have to attach</v>

981
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Speaker 4>like the feeling with the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

982
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 4>So like a lot of my retreats that I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I just bring women,</v>

983
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 4>I facilitate like an anger barn for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>where anger burn,</v>

984
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 4>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a safe place for women to get</v>

985
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:47.900
<v Speaker 4>their anger out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

986
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just catharsis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a whole kind of process</v>

987
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 4>they put them through so they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 4>kind of reconnect maybe earlier life</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences where they didn't feel</v>

989
00:42:57.231 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 4>protected or they felt unsafe or they</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt,</v>

990
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abused or whatever that is.</v>

991
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is just,</v>

992
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 4>this is all comes from my own life</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in working with,</v>

993
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people at this point.</v>

994
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see over and over again.</v>

995
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 4>People that are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut down,</v>

996
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not happy with their life,</v>

997
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.660
<v Speaker 4>have some like unprocessed thing from</v>
<v Speaker 4>their past that just needs to move.</v>

998
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 4>And when I create this space for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start to move that energy,</v>

999
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:32.831
<v Speaker 4>it's like underneath there is creativity</v>
<v Speaker 4>and passion and peace and freedom from</v>

1000
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:39.581
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're looking at me like</v>

1001
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>he's looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is this girl?</v>

1002
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when people have that space to</v>

1003
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 4>unleash that and to let the energy move</v>
<v Speaker 4>through them,</v>

1004
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 4>because I think there's a difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between emotion and feeling.</v>

1005
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:59.770
<v Speaker 4>So feelings to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our physiological responses to thoughts.</v>

1006
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1007
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.100
<v Speaker 4>So if I sit here and think about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future of that I'm scared about,</v>

1008
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to feel anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have like,</v>

1009
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.660
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if like someone breaks in my house</v>

1010
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:13.040
<v Speaker 4>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to feel fear.</v>

1011
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.933
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1012
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can feel regret because of a thought</v>

1013
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:17.900
<v Speaker 4>or guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1014
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Speaker 4>but emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy in motion.</v>

1015
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:25.390
<v Speaker 4>If someone hurts one of your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to experience anger.</v>

1016
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a natural response.</v>

1017
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Someone close to us dies or we have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>heartbreak.</v>

1018
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 4>It's natural to feel the emotion of</v>
<v Speaker 4>sadness.</v>

1019
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 4>And I think that there's a lot of kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of misleading information about like,</v>

1020
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we create all our feelings with our</v>

1021
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and we can just like affirm our</v>
<v Speaker 4>way out of things and think our way out</v>

1022
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to some degree that's true.</v>

1023
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Changing our thinking does a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with some core emotions like anger,</v>

1024
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sadness,</v>

1025
00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 4>I think we've got to feel them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's what people are</v>

1026
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 4>really scared of is actually kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening that box,</v>

1027
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 4>opening that can of worms and going back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually feeling those feelings.</v>

1028
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is they're in there and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't get them up and out in a</v>

1029
00:45:05.611 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 4>healthy way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I think that's what creates a lot</v>

1030
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 4>of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of depression,</v>

1031
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 4>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even disease,</v>

1032
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 4>things like that because they just get</v>
<v Speaker 4>stored in our body somewhere.</v>

1033
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do to these gals?</v>

1034
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.990
<v Speaker 4>What do I do to these gals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1035
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just creating a space that just</v>

1036
00:45:26.321 --> 00:45:27.570
<v Speaker 4>scream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1037
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a pillow fight.</v>

1038
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I give them,</v>

1039
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:34.260

<v Speaker 4>the comments to this,</v>

1043
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:43.890

<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this,</v>

1044
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 4>but here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1045
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:49.800

1046
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Metallica is on my playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1050
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.840

<v Speaker 4>They really want to see it.</v>

1051
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a beat the shit out of a foam</v>

<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or burn or burn playlist.</v>

1055
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you actually.</v>

1057
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.210
<v Speaker 4>So one time I was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rented a house actually out in the</v>

1058
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 4>near here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Gore and people were doing this</v>

1059
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:25.450
<v Speaker 4>process and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I prepped them like the,</v>

1060
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.303
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1061
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they bring to mind things that they've</v>

1062
00:46:29.491 --> 00:46:30.480
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1063
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.810
<v Speaker 4>like we're angry about things from their</v>
<v Speaker 4>childhood,</v>

1064
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just like a throw them in a</v>

1065
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 4>room with loud music and say go after</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1066
00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:37.861
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very,</v>

1067
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:40.560
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of processes I put them</v>
<v Speaker 4>through to get them to this point.</v>

1068
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're doing this one time in this</v>

1069
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 4>house and there's like 20 women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loud music,</v>

1070
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 4>yelling and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cops show up</v>

1071
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 4>and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's like,</v>

1072
00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:57.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you like?</v>

1073
00:46:57.661 --> 00:46:59.610
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I step out,</v>

1074
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I stepped out and I explained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1075
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times I,</v>

1076
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.460
<v Speaker 4>this is a women's workshop and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

1077
00:47:05.461 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1078
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.230
<v Speaker 4>we hold back our emotions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we end up getting irritable and this</v>

1079
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 4>just as healthy way for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1080
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 4>people to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to heal and work on their emotions.</v>

1081
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 4>And the cop looks at me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1082
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.420
<v Speaker 4>can I have your card?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to send my wife.</v>

1083
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 4>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the cop said to me.</v>

1084
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten lots of calls from husbands</v>

1085
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 4>and boyfriends and even kids and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you because there's something</v>

1086
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like pulling off our armor</v>

1087
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about doing like</v>

1088
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 4>the deeper work and kind of going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>those scary places that takes a layer</v>

1089
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:43.420
<v Speaker 4>off of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1090
00:47:43.421 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's similar to plant medicine and a lot</v>

1091
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 4>of ways of like going to those places</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're kind of like,</v>

1092
00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.170
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you?</v>

1093
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Come out the other side and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper understanding of,</v>

1094
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 4>of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1095
00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.160
<v Speaker 1>so by doing something completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and crazy and just letting</v>

1096
00:48:02.161 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 1>loose and all the madness involved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1097
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:05.940
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a reset</v>

1098
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:06.740
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1099
00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:07.551
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.080
<v Speaker 4>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1101
00:48:09.081 --> 00:48:10.910
<v Speaker 4>like it's facilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not this,</v>

1102
00:48:10.911 --> 00:48:12.560
<v Speaker 4>this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1103
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.620
<v Speaker 4>people going into fight screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fight club.</v>

1104
00:48:15.621 --> 00:48:18.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not because there's a difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between Catharsis and like actual right</v>

1105
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 4>processing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's just,</v>

1106
00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.600
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>

1107
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 4>we don't really understand emotion to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level and we think that big</v>

1108
00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:35.300
<v Speaker 4>emotion is crazy and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily,</v>

1109
00:48:35.301 --> 00:48:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I think what is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes people crazy is suppressing</v>

1110
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:44.021
<v Speaker 4>it their whole life and trying to manage</v>
<v Speaker 4>it through their mind or through doing</v>

1111
00:48:44.361 --> 00:48:49.361
<v Speaker 4>things or through whatever else versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like being willing to look at</v>

1112
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.280
<v Speaker 4>those parts of ourselves because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.570
<v Speaker 4>we're humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a mine,</v>

1114
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.280
<v Speaker 4>we have emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have actions,</v>

1115
00:48:55.281 --> 00:48:56.114
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1116
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:58.010
<v Speaker 4>our spiritual self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call that,</v>

1117
00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.170
<v Speaker 4>like something that's connected to</v>
<v Speaker 4>something bigger than us.</v>

1118
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.160
<v Speaker 4>And I think we need a holistic approach</v>
<v Speaker 4>to really gage.</v>

1119
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time that you decided to get</v>

1120
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 1>off of the antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you follow a protocol?</v>

1121
00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to a doctor to discuss it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them?</v>

1122
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you read anything about how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and what advice would you give to</v>

1123
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>anybody out there that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening that also is going through</v>

1124
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 1>that same sort of situation?</v>

1125
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctors told me I couldn't do it,</v>

1126
00:49:24.051 --> 00:49:24.320
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

1127
00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I have good doctors ever stay on and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting paid.</v>

1128
00:49:27.721 --> 00:49:28.554
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1129
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had,</v>

1130

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my coach at the time,</v>

1131
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 4>he was really helpful who was more than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1132
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 4>like coaches such like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what to call her.</v>

1133
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:39.640
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did you find her?</v>

1134
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I was dating a guy who was an addict and</v>
<v Speaker 4>complaining about him to girlfriend at</v>

1135
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:50.030
<v Speaker 4>lunch for like the 80th time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

1136

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>maybe pills and the pills to fun times.</v>

1139
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Good Times.</v>

1142
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1143

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1144
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:09.820

<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>

1145
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you find your coach?</v>

1146

<v Speaker 4>So we're sitting at lunch,</v>

1148
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about this for like the 80th</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1149
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1150
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.440

<v Speaker 4>I went and saw this kind of Kooky woman,</v>

<v Speaker 4>life and I had never been to like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>coach.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I had always been to therapists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrists and so nothing against</v>

1155
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 4>therapists and psychiatrists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do good work.</v>

1156
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had kind of like reached my limit</v>

1157
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I go to this woman's house and</v>

1158
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally stuck in 1985,</v>

1159
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 4>like her decor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her fashion,</v>

1160
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I sit down and I sit across from her</v>

1161
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 4>and she didn't even see me in a normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>

1162
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 4>I think she knew she needed to be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally get me out of my comfort zone.</v>

1163
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 4>So she put me in her son's bedroom with</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these race car,</v>

1164
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 4>bunk beds and I'm sitting there on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>race car,</v>

1165
00:50:56.481 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 4>bunk bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the going,</v>

1166
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 4>where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did I get here?</v>

1167
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 4>And she walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she sits in front of me and it was the</v>

1168
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 4>first time in my life and I felt loved</v>
<v Speaker 4>by my parents,</v>

1169
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>but this was the first time in my life I</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt really seen.</v>

1170
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 4>Like it was almost uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this woman could almost see through</v>

1171
00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:14.150
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could see me,</v>

1172
00:51:14.151 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 4>she could really see me and I felt zero</v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment from her,</v>

1173
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:22.210
<v Speaker 4>like zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And although it was scary and a little</v>

1174
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:25.190
<v Speaker 4>bit because it was like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt very vulnerable.</v>

1175
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was something so reassuring about</v>

1176
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 4>it because she was the first like</v>
<v Speaker 4>practitioner I had seen that didn't see</v>

1177
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 4>me as broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She really just saw me and she was the</v>

1178
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 4>one that in so many ways helped me over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the years get off the medication by</v>

1179
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 4>teaching me how to release my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1180
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 4>by helping me understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 4>bad feelings aren't necessarily bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also got very clear about my diet.</v>

1182
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I got off gluten because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times gluten can impact brain chemistry.</v>

1183
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped drinking and it wasn't ever a</v>

1184
00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 4>big drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I stopped drinking for about two</v>

1185
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:01.400
<v Speaker 4>years because alcohol's a depressant.</v>

1186
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I'd always been into exercise and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fitness and eating healthy and</v>

1187
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 4>everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1188
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:12.160
<v Speaker 4>and then I also started meditating and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like finding some kind of connection to</v>

1189
00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 4>a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really have a name for it at</v>

1190
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but something where I didn't feel like I</v>

1191
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 4>was so alone because that was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the scary things about</v>

1192
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:22.280
<v Speaker 4>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel you feel alone a lot at the</v>

1193
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it was a combination of all of</v>

1194
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:28.500
<v Speaker 4>those things that over time and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>belief that I could,</v>

1195
00:52:28.501 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 4>and I really had to change my belief</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could get off of them.</v>

1196
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for people that are considering it,</v>

1197
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't just stop.</v>

1198
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dangerous just to stop because that</v>

1199
00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 4>can really mess with your brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>

1200
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Find somebody who knows something about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and can put you on a plan,</v>

1201
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.730
<v Speaker 4>can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1202
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a doctor.</v>

1203
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to get met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get give medical advice.</v>

1204
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:54.210
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1205
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 4>consulted doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1206
00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:01.300
<v Speaker 4>but for me it was number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the belief that I could and number two,</v>

1207
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 4>finding the people that could really</v>
<v Speaker 4>support me.</v>

1208
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:07.760
<v Speaker 4>And number three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making the lifestyle changes that I</v>

1209
00:53:07.761 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 4>needed to make to support it and being</v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to go to that dark,</v>

1210
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 4>scary place that I was afraid to go to.</v>

1211
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.920
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by when you say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the first person that didn't see</v>

1212
00:53:19.921 --> 00:53:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you as broken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1213
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.770
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by they all,</v>

1214
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they all saw you as broken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1215
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1216
00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.880
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1217
00:53:28.881 --> 00:53:32.150
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I would go to one of these doctors</v>

1218
00:53:32.151 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 4>or therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they'd see that I was on</v>

1219
00:53:34.881 --> 00:53:39.881
<v Speaker 4>medication since I was 10 and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kind of relate to me in that way</v>

1220
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.330
<v Speaker 1>as a depressed person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1221
00:53:43.331 --> 00:53:45.810
<v Speaker 1>just more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a label like this is it,</v>

1222
00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why they weren't willing</v>

1223
00:53:48.431 --> 00:53:50.440
<v Speaker 1>to consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you getting off of the medication?</v>

1224
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the is a part of who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1225
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.510
<v Speaker 1>You got to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a daily thing.</v>

1226
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like brushing your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to stop.</v>

1227
00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:57.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1228
00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what they were</v>

1229
00:53:59.051 --> 00:54:03.010
<v Speaker 4>thinking was just know how it felt and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just did it.</v>

1230
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was because like at the time I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't believe it yet either.</v>

1231
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I need to someone who believed in</v>

1232
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.560
<v Speaker 1>more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that also the people that</v>

1233
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 1>deal with people every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a psychologist or a</v>

1234
00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:16.820
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're so inundated with people and</v>

1235
00:54:16.821 --> 00:54:20.180
<v Speaker 1>their fucking problems that after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you just become overwhelmed and</v>

1236
00:54:20.181 --> 00:54:24.560
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to see people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a fresh reset every time you</v>

1237
00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:26.790
<v Speaker 1>see something like this is a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her name's Christine.</v>

1238
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Hey Christine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with you?</v>

1239
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1240
00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:31.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrists,</v>

1241
00:54:31.671 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 4>they have hard jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like imagine your whole day is person</v>

1242
00:54:35.031 --> 00:54:38.360
<v Speaker 4>after person talking about what's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 4>with their life.</v>

1243
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 4>You know that that can be very draining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1244
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.910
<v Speaker 4>even when I first started as a life</v>
<v Speaker 4>coach and I saw person after person</v>

1245
00:54:43.911 --> 00:54:46.610
<v Speaker 4>after person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really had to learn not to take that</v>

1246
00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:49.430
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not to let it drain me.</v>

1247
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so again,</v>

1248
00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 4>like I have a lot of respect for their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at my mom's a therapist,</v>

1249
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:57.710
<v Speaker 4>so I have a lot of respect for</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapists and psychiatrists are very</v>

1250
00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:02.711
<v Speaker 4>helpful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think for me in my life journey</v>

1251
00:55:03.171 --> 00:55:05.330
<v Speaker 4>and what I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1252
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to spend the rest of my</v>

1253
00:55:08.121 --> 00:55:10.690
<v Speaker 4>life medicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really did it.</v>

1254
00:55:10.691 --> 00:55:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 1>So what is the difference between life</v>
<v Speaker 1>on medication and life off medication</v>

1256
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 1>and how long has the process of weaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

1257
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it took me,</v>

1258
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:26.780
<v Speaker 4>it took me a good two years to feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was finally kind of out of my system.</v>

1259
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long was it before you were actually</v>

1260
00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:31.470
<v Speaker 1>stopping taking it?</v>

1261
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I,</v>

1262
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.770
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

1263
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.950
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I,</v>

1264
00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.280
<v Speaker 4>I probably weaned for a good six months</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was like a year and a half</v>

1265
00:55:40.281 --> 00:55:42.450
<v Speaker 4>till I felt like it was like cleared out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my system.</v>

1266
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for six months you slowly wean</v>

1267
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself off of it and then at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of six months you're not taking the</v>

1268
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>medication anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still feel foggy.</v>

1269
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1270
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1271
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like my system was recalibrating,</v>

1272
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all my brain chemistry was recalibrating</v>

1273
00:55:57.871 --> 00:55:59.700
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause that stuff affects your brain</v>

1274
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:01.260
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It affected my hormones.</v>

1275
00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1276
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:04.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it effected a lot.</v>

1277
00:56:04.091 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So did you take like one pill and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it down to three quarters of a pill</v>

1279
00:56:08.861 --> 00:56:09.694
<v Speaker 1>and then</v>

1280
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:15.050
<v Speaker 4>I did consult a psychiatrist and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave me like a winning plan.</v>

1281
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever at different people,</v>

1282
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 4>like it's not a standard thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like different psychiatrists will tell</v>

1283
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 4>you different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it depends on what dosage you're on,</v>

1284
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:25.930
<v Speaker 4>how long you've been on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which medication you're on,</v>

1285
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 4>what the side effects for for it are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of things.</v>

1286
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 4>What does it feel like when you're first</v>
<v Speaker 4>day no pills?</v>

1287
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the first day I woke up and I</v>

1288
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:40.570
<v Speaker 4>felt clear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I felt like</v>

1289
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get kicked out of here.</v>

1290
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1291
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.970
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1292
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 4>like it was like out of me and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1293
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.130
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just felt like a fog and a</v>

1294
00:56:55.131 --> 00:56:57.560
<v Speaker 4>heaviness had lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just fell.</v>

1295
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>And I also felt like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had deeper access to my creativity,</v>

1296
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.600
<v Speaker 4>my intuition and all those things were</v>
<v Speaker 4>present,</v>

1297
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 4>but it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was just sort of like some white</v>

1298
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 4>noise there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also like for me,</v>

1299
00:57:14.171 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 4>depression manifested as being</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly self critical,</v>

1300
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.620
<v Speaker 4>like super self critical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this very,</v>

1301
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very loud inner critic.</v>

1302
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.880
<v Speaker 4>And so that started to lift too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1303
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I was doing all kinds of other work at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same time.</v>

1304
00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was studying with my life coach,</v>

1305
00:57:29.201 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 4>I was getting a master's degree in</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual psychology.</v>

1306
00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 4>I was a spiritual psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1307
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 4>good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1308
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a place called the University of</v>

1309
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Santa Monica and I didn't know anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>about this place,</v>

1310
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 4>but I had been a life coach and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

1311
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.400
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm helping people with their life,</v>

1312
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:47.680
<v Speaker 4>I've got to know how to help them deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with their past.</v>

1313
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't just work on present and</v>
<v Speaker 4>future without like having some skills</v>

1314
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 4>for dealing with your past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was researching schools.</v>

1315
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I thought if I could get a master's</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree in psychology that would help me</v>

1316
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 4>and that would be good for my career and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things to have like some</v>

1317
00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 4>credentials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I researched and I find this school</v>

1318
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't really know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and I'm like,</v>

1319
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 4>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the spiritual part didn't have</v>

1320
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:10.240
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with any religion or</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>

1321
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 4>It was more of the premise of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that traditional psychology is,</v>

1322
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 4>is kind of a little bit more about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>labels and spiritual psychology is more</v>

1323
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 4>people have the inner resources they</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to to heal.</v>

1324
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.750
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again didn't know much about it.</v>

1325
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Show up at this school with my laptop</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking I'm going to like take notes</v>

1326
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:32.110
<v Speaker 4>and there's going to be lectures but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are no desks.</v>

1327
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:37.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a highly experiential school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I said a two year program and</v>

1328
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 4>in that I really learned how to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>change my belief systems.</v>

1329
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 4>He'll stuff from my past connect to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of me cause we all have like our</v>

1330
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 4>basic self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like our conscious part.</v>

1331
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 4>But I believe we also have something</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper like art,</v>

1332
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 4>we can call it our intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can call it our gut feeling,</v>

1333
00:58:56.861 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 4>we can call it our authentic self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some kind of inner wisdom</v>

1334
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 4>that I think all of us have access to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this program really helped me get</v>

1335
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 4>more access to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that part of me so that I could start</v>

1336
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:12.330
<v Speaker 4>listening to that more than my old</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>

1337
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Speaker 4>My old belief system is my old fears</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

1338
00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 4>when we're born we're kind of this blank</v>
<v Speaker 4>slate and then stuff happens.</v>

1339
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 4>And we formed these stories about our</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives and who we are and how we get love</v>

1340
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 4>and how we get validation and how we get</v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptance and how life works and who we</v>

1341
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 4>are and our identity.</v>

1342
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 4>And it's kind of a just a story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have,</v>

1343
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 4>we can change that story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it takes work going back and</v>

1344
00:59:36.891 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 4>deconstructing that story and letting go</v>
<v Speaker 4>of some old beliefs that maybe we've</v>

1345
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 4>hung on to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to create a different one.</v>

1346
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what so much of my journey has</v>

1347
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:52.001
<v Speaker 4>been about is kind of looking at what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story I've created about my life and</v>

1348
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 4>how can I change it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the story that I had was I'm</v>

1349
00:59:56.421 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1350
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be achieving all the time,</v>

1351
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>being hard on myself as how I motivate</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

1352
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:04.010
<v Speaker 4>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm constantly rejected,</v>

1353
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:04.431
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1354
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:04.791
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1355
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by believing that story,</v>

1356
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 4>it was creating results in my life that</v>
<v Speaker 4>align,</v>

1357
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.090
<v Speaker 4>that aligned with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so to create different results,</v>

1358
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:12.920
<v Speaker 4>I had to have a different story to tell.</v>

1359
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this shift that that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take place.</v>

1360
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like turning a battleship,</v>

1361
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1362
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not a quick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>

1363
01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1364
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's another,</v>

1365
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of let downs people have when they</v>

1366
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.720
<v Speaker 4>go to a seminar or read one book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they expect to change overnight.</v>

1367
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.820
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a process.</v>

1368
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1369
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told this story before,</v>

1370
01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>but she was so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's friends with my friend Kelly,</v>

1371
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Kelly corrosion comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny girl.</v>

1373
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1374
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>she was at the comedy store one night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1375
01:00:50.531 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

1376
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>she was talking to Kelly and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1377
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to her and she started</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on about her future,</v>

1378
01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>all the things that she was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was going to be married within a</v>

1379
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was going to have the career that</v>

1380
01:01:04.031 --> 01:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was going to this and that and that</v>

1381
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1382
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so confused and she was like,</v>

1383
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the secret I'm doing,</v>

1384
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know about the secret?</v>

1385
01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1386
01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of positive thinking,</v>

1387
01:01:19.091 --> 01:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1388
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that,</v>

1389
01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not just positive thinking.</v>

1390
01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do create your own future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create your own identity.</v>

1391
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>You create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1392
01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create reality.</v>

1393
01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:30.244
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1394
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>like you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

1395
01:01:32.201 --> 01:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know I'm,</v>

1396
01:01:33.671 --> 01:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1397
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1398
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with all that stuff,</v>

1399
01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never heard of it,</v>

1400
01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>is what do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1401
01:01:41.581 --> 01:01:42.414
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1402
01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>the term for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to achieve law of</v>

1403
01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:46.504
<v Speaker 1>attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to achieve is</v>

1405
01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the a photo of your dream</v>

1406
01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pin it on your wall,</v>

1407
01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you take a photo of a Ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pin that on the wall.</v>

1408
01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you watch those</v>

1409
01:02:00.131 --> 01:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they say,</v>

1410
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this photo of my home on the mall.</v>

1411
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I had the Ferrari that I wanted.</v>

1412
01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I had my dream life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have those things.</v>

1413
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I made those things happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention and with thought.</v>

1414
01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many fucking people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a photo of a beautiful house on their</v>

1415
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>wall and a Ferrari?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got no fucking house and they</v>

1416
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>got no Ferrari and they never will like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1417
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it from a biased pool of</v>

1418
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>successful people who will tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened to them.</v>

1419
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>But there are literally millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who think positive and nothing</v>

1420
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>ever happens to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this girl who,</v>

1421
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very nice person,</v>

1422
01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came to one of my shows like a year</v>

1423
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>later and a were hanging out outside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1424
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>how's everything when you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1425
01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a drag,</v>

1426
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was convinced that by this</v>

1427
01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>time I would have all these things.</v>

1428
01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1429
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still,</v>

1430
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and this and that and I've got</v>

1431
01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem and I just don't understand</v>

1432
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

1433
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I believe that I was so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had this like,</v>

1434
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting because she</v>

1435
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>was like two different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd met her twice.</v>

1436
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I meet her this one time and she's</v>

1437
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:21.951
<v Speaker 1>just a glow with this delusion that now</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got it and she's getting,</v>

1438
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

1439
01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 1>she thought also that talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time was part of how you affirm</v>

1440
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:28.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was saying,</v>

1441
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be married in a year.</v>

1442
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm following the secrets.</v>

1443
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 1>She kept saying it and it was whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later she was just,</v>

1444
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

1445
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And so we had this sort of heart to</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart about it.</v>

1446
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Haven't talked to her again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what the hell happened</v>

1447
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never forget it because the two</v>

1448
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1449
01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl who was like,</v>

1450
01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>it was like kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all why I didn't believe in.</v>

1451
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half I think just wasn't</v>

1452
01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 1>happening and life was still kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>

1453
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't understand why the career</v>

1454
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:08.211
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen and alive didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's is all,</v>

1455
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a slow shift.</v>

1456
01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:15.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a slow shift and I think the law of</v>
<v Speaker 4>attraction can be misleading because</v>

1457
01:04:15.701 --> 01:04:16.900
<v Speaker 4>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1458
01:04:16.901 --> 01:04:21.901
<v Speaker 4>change takes more than I put a picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and I do some positive affirmations.</v>

1459
01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:26.260
<v Speaker 4>If like down deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel like you're worthy,</v>

1460
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're,</v>

1461
01:04:28.721 --> 01:04:31.180
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to attract</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

1462
01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 4>You've got to like kind of go back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with core issues and core beliefs,</v>

1463
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:37.660
<v Speaker 4>systems in order to shift things in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1464
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was as easy as putting pictures up</v>

1465
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:41.740
<v Speaker 4>on our wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody would have,</v>

1466
01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:43.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini's and hot and wives and</v>

1467
01:04:43.871 --> 01:04:44.740
<v Speaker 4>husbands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1468
01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.780
<v Speaker 4>but it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes more than that.</v>

1469
01:04:46.781 --> 01:04:51.550
<v Speaker 4>It takes being willing to like do some</v>
<v Speaker 4>work and take some responsibility rather</v>

1470
01:04:51.551 --> 01:04:55.570
<v Speaker 4>than just thinking the universe is Santa</v>
<v Speaker 4>Claus and just was going to pop</v>

1471
01:04:55.571 --> 01:04:56.860
<v Speaker 4>something into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I acquainted</v>

1472
01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>to people that are morbidly obese that</v>
<v Speaker 1>want a six pack.</v>

1473
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be done,</v>

1474
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1475
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 1>You got a long road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1476
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to climb Mount Everest and</v>

1477
01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you're starting in Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta fucking get to Mount Everest.</v>

1478
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely</v>

1479
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:13.820
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1480
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:16.280
<v Speaker 4>And then that's when people ask me how</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get off antidepressants?</v>

1481
01:05:16.281 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1482
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 4>I just did this and then I did this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I did this.</v>

1483
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was years of like,</v>

1484
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deciding I was going to and having the</v>

1485
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:27.370
<v Speaker 4>right people around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

1486
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably the hardest thing I've</v>

1487
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:30.484
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1488
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Now what is the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants and like Xanax?</v>

1489
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you were taking both.</v>

1490
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need the Xanax if you're</v>

1491
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>already pilled up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants?</v>

1492
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1493
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:43.490
<v Speaker 4>not an MD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not my territory,</v>

1494
01:05:43.491 --> 01:05:47.600
<v Speaker 4>but for me like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the antidepressants just kind of kept me</v>

1495
01:05:47.601 --> 01:05:52.280
<v Speaker 4>steady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then with my boyfriend at the time</v>

1496
01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:56.510
<v Speaker 4>and my crazy Hollywood life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just had so much anxiety and you</v>

1497

<v Speaker 4>you go to a doctor and you're like,</v>

1498

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>anxiety?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm like worried or not worried a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kind of high,</v>

1501
01:06:05.991 --> 01:06:09.020
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not able to calm down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1507
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And then supplements,</v>

<v Speaker 4>vitamins and stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1514
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever miss it?</v>

1515
01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Like is there ever a time when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1516
01:06:44.241 --> 01:06:46.950
<v Speaker 1>God damage my pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xanax and fucking drinking glasses?</v>

1517
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1518
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.100
<v Speaker 4>I will say this though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1519
01:06:50.101 --> 01:06:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I had my eyes Lasik,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lasik,</v>

1520
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 4>the Lasik and they gave me valium and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1521
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:59.970
<v Speaker 4>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see why people get addicted to this.</v>

1522
01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.150
<v Speaker 4>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm glad they did because I was</v>

1523
01:07:03.151 --> 01:07:07.710
<v Speaker 4>super freaked out about them cutting my</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyeball open and valium just relaxes you</v>

1524
01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:09.480
<v Speaker 4>rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't done it felt great.</v>

1525
01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>And then the only time I ever did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1526
01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:15.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't miss that because what I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>now is,</v>

1527
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:20.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I feel clear and alive and you</v>

1528
01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:23.370
<v Speaker 4>don't feel happy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have my days,</v>

1529
01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:27.010
<v Speaker 4>but I don't relate to it as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed right now.</v>

1530
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:27.871
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1531
01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:29.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1532
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human experience and not having the</v>

1533
01:07:30.961 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>

1534
01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I think stories like this is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring to people and I think it's</v>

1535
01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:36.540
<v Speaker 1>very important in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want,</v>

1536
01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1537
01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for people to look at people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't doing well and talk to them</v>

1538
01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1539
01:07:42.721 --> 01:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1540
01:07:44.141 --> 01:07:44.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1541
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Let me get the fuck away from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1542
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's how people think.</v>

1543
01:07:47.581 --> 01:07:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to deal with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are his problems are I wanna I</v>

1544
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>wanna I want to separate my and</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on myself.</v>

1545
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think when someone like you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of express how you were in this</v>

1546
01:07:59.551 --> 01:08:04.320
<v Speaker 1>really bad state and yours is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre situation because you're talking</v>

1547
01:08:04.321 --> 01:08:07.500
<v Speaker 1>about being on these pills from the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 10 right.</v>

1548
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really unique.</v>

1549
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 1>But then having almost a decade off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1550
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>seven years off of them.</v>

1551
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:08:14.211 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm a state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:17.300
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1554
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.770
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it helps me help people.</v>

1555
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Like it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had lots of training as a life</v>

1556
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 4>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my own life experiences have been</v>

1557
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's really given me the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most critics,</v>

1558
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1559
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 3>you credentials or that you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

1560
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually happy.</v>

1561
01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:37.810
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1562
01:08:37.811 --> 01:08:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been able to create a life and a</v>

1563
01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:43.240
<v Speaker 4>career in friendships and connection</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1564
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I no longer live that story of</v>

1565
01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:46.870
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Hate Christine Club.</v>

1566
01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I have great friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great women friends,</v>

1567
01:08:48.401 --> 01:08:49.690
<v Speaker 4>like all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1568
01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:50.650
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1569
01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm no like different or more special</v>

1570
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.360
<v Speaker 4>than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just again,</v>

1571
01:08:55.390 --> 01:09:00.390
<v Speaker 4>choices and I made choices that led me</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this point.</v>

1572
01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:04.030
<v Speaker 4>And everybody has that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has that freedom.</v>

1573
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.400
<v Speaker 4>What's the book man's search for</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning?</v>

1574
01:09:06.401 --> 01:09:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever read that book by Viktor</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frankl?</v>

1575
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.450
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1576
01:09:10.451 --> 01:09:11.380
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1577
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.140
<v Speaker 4>in concentration camps and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually a psychiatrist,</v>

1578
01:09:14.141 --> 01:09:16.270
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he talked about,</v>

1579
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he kept himself saying,</v>

1580
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:20.350
<v Speaker 4>and he kept himself free through his</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1581
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:23.500
<v Speaker 4>And he says in between stimulus and</v>
<v Speaker 4>response,</v>

1582
01:09:23.501 --> 01:09:26.980
<v Speaker 4>basically what happens and how we</v>
<v Speaker 4>respond is a choice.</v>

1583
01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:29.020
<v Speaker 4>And in that choice lies our ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

1584
01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.410
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1585
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.550
<v Speaker 4>that's what we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That freedom,</v>

1586
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.500
<v Speaker 4>no matter what your circumstances.</v>

1587
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone comes to you and they're</v>

1588
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:37.801
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christine,</v>

1589
01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get my shit together.</v>

1590
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1591
01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you start with somebody?</v>

1592
01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 3>But it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1593
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is there anything that people are</v>

1594
01:09:50.671 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 3>universally could benefit from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there,</v>

1595
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.690
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number one thing that,</v>

1597
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.910
<v Speaker 4>where I start with people is having them</v>
<v Speaker 4>really look at their relationship with</v>

1598
01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:05.160
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when they come,</v>

1599
01:10:05.161 --> 01:10:05.671
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1600
01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:07.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I need help.</v>

1601
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.540
<v Speaker 4>They're relating to themselves as if</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's,</v>

1602
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's wrong with them and they're</v>

1603
01:10:11.011 --> 01:10:14.160
<v Speaker 4>being really hard on themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've kind of lost hope and lost</v>

1604
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:18.300
<v Speaker 4>belief in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing is just like</v>

1605
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.010
<v Speaker 4>acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accepting where you are.</v>

1606
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

1607
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I haven't liked everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to me,</v>

1608
01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:27.780
<v Speaker 4>but one of the main raise I've been able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move through it is because I stopped</v>

1609
01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:29.700
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't that like in martial arts,</v>

1610
01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:31.830
<v Speaker 4>if a punch comes at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to resist it.</v>

1611
01:10:31.831 --> 01:10:33.510
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to kind of move with it.</v>

1612
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Move away from it or roll with it,</v>

1613
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.353
<v Speaker 3>roll with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1614
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Like your teeth are your teeth and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on a job.</v>

1615
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1616
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.240
<v Speaker 4>And in life we kind of do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

1617
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.170
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this break up.</v>

1618
01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:44.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this layoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We resist it,</v>

1619
01:10:44.551 --> 01:10:46.260
<v Speaker 4>we fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>

1620
01:10:46.261 --> 01:10:48.430
<v Speaker 4>can we just get to acceptance of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1621
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.480
<v Speaker 4>where are you are who you are and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening right now?</v>

1622
01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Perspective and perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.670
<v Speaker 4>And when you can get to that neutral</v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

1624
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.440
<v Speaker 4>that's when you can start doing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1625
01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:00.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's when you can start doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

1626
01:11:00.721 --> 01:11:03.000
<v Speaker 4>And then the second thing is I ask</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>

1627
01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.240
<v Speaker 4>do you believe you can shift?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that you have like the</v>

1628
01:11:06.241 --> 01:11:08.370
<v Speaker 4>power to make different choices and</v>
<v Speaker 4>change?</v>

1629
01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.820
<v Speaker 4>And you don't have to know how that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my job.</v>

1630
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll help you with the how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to believe you can</v>

1631
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 4>because if we don't believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible for us and it's really hard to</v>

1632
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 4>make any kind of change in our life.</v>

1633
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1634
01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is giant.</v>

1635
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>But how does someone believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you get someone to believe</v>

1636
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that they can make change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do they have to see evidence in</v>

1637
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:34.100
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1638
01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>is there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you recommend like attempting things</v>

1639
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:42.300
<v Speaker 1>or tasks or hobbies or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1640
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Well a lot of times it's going back to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>time in your life where you did take a</v>

1641
01:11:47.171 --> 01:11:50.350
<v Speaker 4>chance or you did do something that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a stretch in some way.</v>

1642
01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody has times in their life</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they've done something they</v>

1643
01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:58.630
<v Speaker 4>weren't completely sure they could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's just a little thing and</v>

1644
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:01.600
<v Speaker 4>everybody has that reference point they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can go back to.</v>

1645
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:05.710
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of this joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like honestly a lot of it is taking a</v>

1646
01:12:05.711 --> 01:12:10.450
<v Speaker 4>leap of faith and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a lot of those and I've</v>

1647
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:15.340
<v Speaker 4>wanted to know the answer and I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to know like 100% that this would</v>

1648
01:12:15.341 --> 01:12:17.680
<v Speaker 4>be guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I take this leap of faith,</v>

1649
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:18.930
<v Speaker 4>everything will work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1650
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.430
<v Speaker 4>they haven't always been 100%</v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantees,</v>

1651
01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.300
<v Speaker 4>but it was in taking that leap and</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking that chance and having a little</v>

1652
01:12:25.301 --> 01:12:30.130
<v Speaker 4>faith that things started showing up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things started shifting and that's what</v>

1653
01:12:30.131 --> 01:12:33.880
<v Speaker 4>started to create the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a tricky thing cause I think</v>

1654
01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:36.430
<v Speaker 4>people want evidence before they make</v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1655
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.310
<v Speaker 4>But you have to start making these</v>
<v Speaker 4>little changes,</v>

1656
01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:42.280
<v Speaker 4>beef to start having the evidence show</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1657
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I answered your</v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

1658
01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>

1659
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1660
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I've often said that very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks.</v>

1661
01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Like a anything that's difficult that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do?</v>

1662
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you the confidence that you can</v>

1663
01:12:55.091 --> 01:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>overcome adversity and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1664
01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's I'm a martial art thing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines or marathon</v>

1665
01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>running or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do something like that,</v>

1666
01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:08.620
<v Speaker 1>these incremental changes happen where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push yourself through things,</v>

1667
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 1>especially if you can achieve a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could set out to do something,</v>

1668
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you achieve that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to run a marathon by the</v>

1669
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>end of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I keep saying marathon,</v>

1670
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It doing things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be motivating.</v>

1672
01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Factors are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can help push you.</v>

1673
01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>They can be the engine that starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>push things in a positive direction</v>

1674
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.020
<v Speaker 4>and you start to believe in yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to believe,</v>

1675
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:32.420
<v Speaker 4>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I can do this.</v>

1676
01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 4>I can take this step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1677
01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:37.520
<v Speaker 4>I often tell people that show up or come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a workshop.</v>

1678
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just that fact that you're here is proof</v>

1679
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.910
<v Speaker 4>that you believe you can change because</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you wouldn't have shown up if some</v>

1680
01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:46.520
<v Speaker 4>part of you was an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1681
01:13:46.521 --> 01:13:48.350
<v Speaker 4>kind of certain that you could,</v>

1682
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had someone come to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1683
01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't even help this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl.</v>

1684
01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:53.503
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

1685
01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get mostly dudes or girls?</v>

1686
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only coach a few people now.</v>

1687
01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my retreats are mostly women.</v>

1688
01:14:00.161 --> 01:14:04.030
<v Speaker 4>My private clients both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then my courses and stuff.</v>

1689
01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.080
<v Speaker 1>How can we have retreats that are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

1690
01:14:06.081 --> 01:14:06.914
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1691
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:08.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1692
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get,</v>

1693
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1694
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 4>will be both men and women soon and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a recipe for danger,</v>

1695
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depressed people hopping in the woods or</v>

1696
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:18.260
<v Speaker 4>wherever we're going first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one that everybody's depressed.</v>

1697
01:14:18.261 --> 01:14:23.261
<v Speaker 4>Some people come just to grow and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the range means they're out in the</v>

1698
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 4>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1699
01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to do it in places like Bali and</v>

1700
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This might be able to,</v>

1701
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:45.300
<v Speaker 4>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1702
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:48.140
<v Speaker 4>whenever I go to anywhere tropical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get eaten alive.</v>

1703
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:50.980
<v Speaker 4>Alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what other people have three</v>

1704
01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 4>bites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have 400.</v>

1705
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I finally figured out B one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin B,</v>

1706
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:56.014
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

1707
01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 4>It's totally stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to find it.</v>

1708
01:14:58.571 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't take a b complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's vitamin B one.</v>

1709
01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's for some reason stops in</v>

1710
01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes and bug bites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1711
01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I just know worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does something to change your smell.</v>

1712
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just worked.</v>

1713
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Speaker 4>It was my salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so happy.</v>

1714
01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 4>They don't bite you at all a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1715
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 4>it went from being eaten alive to just</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a few.</v>

1716
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever try thermacell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1717
01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:30.540
<v Speaker 1>What's that term?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cell is a device that a lot of people</v>

1718
01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 1>take when they go camping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things along those lines.</v>

1719
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:33.563
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1720
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:35.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1721
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.480
<v Speaker 1>it looks like almost like a radio and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has these little pads and you slide</v>

1722
01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:44.481
<v Speaker 1>these pads into this heating element and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very fine mist comes out of this</v>

1723
01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:47.040
<v Speaker 1>heating element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could put it on the ground near you</v>

1724
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and the bugs won't come with an 18 foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle.</v>

1725
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1726
01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Use it when you're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're in the woods because if</v>

1727
01:15:54.541 --> 01:15:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the woods,</v>

1728
01:15:55.921 --> 01:15:59.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Alaska or Alberta,</v>

1729
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever been to Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summer,</v>

1730
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the mosquitoes are insane because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>own their only alive for a month.</v>

1731
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so today's good at town like rabbit,</v>

1732
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:13.480
<v Speaker 1>barbarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes like me and my friend Ari</v>

1733
01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:17.830
<v Speaker 1>went fishing in Alaska and it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy that you would get out of the car.</v>

1734
01:16:17.831 --> 01:16:19.000
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1735
01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get out of the car,</v>

1736
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you open the door and then won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hit with a cloud of mosquitoes.</v>

1737
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>We jumped back in the car and shut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>door and we were in the car with like 50</v>

1738
01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:30.100
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

1739
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:33.710
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we're spraying ourselves well as</v>

1740
01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.380
<v Speaker 1>spray all these toxic chemicals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>found out about thermo cells,</v>

1741
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>dermal cells just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cleans it out totally.</v>

1742
01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:43.030
<v Speaker 1>There's an easy to travel with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1743
01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>they don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really light.</v>

1744
01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you barely smells,</v>

1745
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but bugs don't want to have anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with it.</v>

1746
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Mosquitoes don't want to have anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with it without thermacell was</v>

1747
01:16:52.751 --> 01:16:55.150
<v Speaker 1>like hanging out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sitting in a spot.</v>

1748
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unbearable unless you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquito netting and you don't want to</v>

1749
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:02.250
<v Speaker 1>wear like all that mosquito bug spray</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and your,</v>

1750
01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:05.110
<v Speaker 1>your skin is an Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know all that stuff that you're</v>

1751
01:17:05.111 --> 01:17:07.570
<v Speaker 1>putting on your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just not good.</v>

1752
01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I was using my first couple</v>

1753
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 3>of days on my last trip and I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting sick and I'm like,</v>

1754
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

1755
01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're processing it with your</v>

1756
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 3>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible skin.</v>

1757
01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:19.000
<v Speaker 3>It gets in your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

1758
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure there's probably some</v>

1759
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:24.220
<v Speaker 3>nontoxic alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they probably don't work then so be</v>

1760
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 3>it worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1761
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 3>b one you hear it folks five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that before.</v>

1762
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:31.970
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine was telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Africa.</v>

1763
01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.690
<v Speaker 3>They went to Africa and they took a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of b vitamins that did it,</v>

1764
01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:38.280
<v Speaker 3>but b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one in particular did it for me.</v>

1765
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Find anything on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1766
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I found something that said that studies</v>
<v Speaker 3>are inconclusive but it may make</v>

1767
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.081
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1768
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Stink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1769
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1770
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.920
<v Speaker 3>It's fine for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dig it up.</v>

1771
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's like a vitamin that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people think you smelt good.</v>

1772
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 3>People are mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't.</v>

1773
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if bananas don't eat bananas for</v>

1774
01:17:58.491 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 3>mosquito season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat bananas.</v>

1775
01:17:59.901 --> 01:18:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would think that like,</v>

1776
01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:06.770
<v Speaker 1>well it does probably like weird smells</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not even sure you did</v>

1777
01:18:06.771 --> 01:18:09.070
<v Speaker 1>attacked you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some people just give off a weird</v>

1778
01:18:09.071 --> 01:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>odor to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1779
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even like a,</v>

1780
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:16.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe not an odor odor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they just feel weird.</v>

1781
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that,</v>

1782
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:20.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan,</v>

1783
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.540
<v Speaker 1>my friend of WHO's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1784
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:23.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1785
01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.690
<v Speaker 1>he's a author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a sex at dawn.</v>

1786
01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

1787
01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Smart Guy.</v>

1788
01:18:29.381 --> 01:18:34.381
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me that there's certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>odors that human beings have and those</v>

1789
01:18:35.861 --> 01:18:39.430
<v Speaker 1>odors enabled people to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're genetically</v>

1790
01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.890
<v Speaker 1>compatible with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1791
01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:45.730
<v Speaker 1>like they used to be when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to always hear about couples</v>

1792
01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:49.720
<v Speaker 1>taking blood tests to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have babies together.</v>

1793
01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing.</v>

1794
01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:53.830
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would make sure that they were</v>

1795
01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:54.670
<v Speaker 1>compatible.</v>

1796
01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And I don't even know if there's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>science behind it,</v>

1797
01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but they would take blood tests to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out they were compatible.</v>

1798
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being like really common</v>

1799
01:19:04.361 --> 01:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

1800
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.960
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1801
01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:09.310
<v Speaker 1>the eighties or the nineties or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it was.</v>

1802
01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.620
<v Speaker 1>The dark ages of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that easy,</v>

1803
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:13.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.930
<v Speaker 1>But not compatible obviously personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise and all the other things that come</v>

1805
01:19:16.931 --> 01:19:18.580
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were,</v>

1806
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.570
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan was saying that women can</v>

1807
01:19:22.571 --> 01:19:26.980
<v Speaker 1>smell a man's clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could smell,</v>

1808
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:31.450
<v Speaker 1>literally smelled their clothes and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would know whether or not they would be</v>

1809
01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:36.451
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that person based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell that a person's getting.</v>

1810
01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

1811
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy stinks.</v>

1812
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.480
<v Speaker 1>But like literally like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body knows what's repulsive and</v>

1813
01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:47.440
<v Speaker 1>what's not repulsive in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics based on someone's odor that</v>

1814
01:19:47.441 --> 01:19:48.610
<v Speaker 1>they give off on their clothes.</v>

1815
01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.730
<v Speaker 1>But what it didn't work is when they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>women on the pill.</v>

1816
01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they put women on the pill,</v>

1817
01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:58.060
<v Speaker 1>they were no longer able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate whether or not someone was</v>

1818
01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:01.870
<v Speaker 1>genetically compatible by smelling them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it gave you,</v>

1819
01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it fogged up your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your natural senses.</v>

1820
01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Because I think when you're on pill you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't actually articulate.</v>

1821
01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.043
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1822
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So you're not in the natural rhythm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

1823
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a natural feeling that</v>

1824
01:20:15.481 --> 01:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>women have when they're around a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would breed with or a guy they</v>

1825
01:20:20.341 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't breed with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kay got to go,</v>

1826
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and that is probably a good</v>

1827
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that people that are on the pill</v>

1828
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>might be making like really shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic choices,</v>

1829
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:32.600
<v Speaker 1>like literally genetic choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1830
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you can blame your last bad ex boyfriend</v>
<v Speaker 1>on being on the pill.</v>

1831
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.510
<v Speaker 1>You could give us now I'm accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think you can.</v>

1832
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

1833
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Chris is probably listening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go and you fucked it up.</v>

1834
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's probably something</v>

1835
01:20:48.721 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 1>to instinctual reactions to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1837
01:20:52.831 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 1>have you ever met someone and like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

1838
01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to be around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1839
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out years later that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's fucking crazy or this or</v>

1840
01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:02.310
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1841
01:21:02.311 --> 01:21:07.311
<v Speaker 1>I think people give off in detectable in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like what we classify as</v>

1842
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:10.350
<v Speaker 1>smells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe these pheromones have some</v>

1843
01:21:10.351 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 1>sort of a weird reaction to your birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>control pills affects women's taste in</v>

1844
01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:14.700
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

1845
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How synthetic hormones changed desires</v>

1846
01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:20.380
<v Speaker 1>and women and their choice of a mate</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate.</v>

1847
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

1848
01:21:22.621 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1849
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it just makes sense.</v>

1850
01:21:26.401 --> 01:21:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor your body must be so confused.</v>

1851
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Like this pitch is pregnant all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1852
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1853
01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what it thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body thinks you're pregnant all the</v>

1854
01:21:35.431 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1855
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.140
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1856
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the pill scares me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just synthetic hormones pumping through</v>

1857
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.180
<v Speaker 1>your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Tim can't be all that good to never get</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1859
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of women never get off it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there on it forever.</v>

1860
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1861
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes my hair oily when I'm off it.</v>

1862
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's stuff like that.</v>

1863
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways to balance your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

1864
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a hormone specialist,</v>

1865
01:21:56.881 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but why does hormones make a girl's hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>oily?</v>

1866
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1867
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 1>How do we get on the subject?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells.</v>

1868
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't take dudes,</v>

1869
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.110
<v Speaker 1>dudes on retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1870
01:22:10.111 --> 01:22:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I would think that like getting a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that try and get their life</v>

1871
01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>together and then having them all</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1872
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:18.260
<v Speaker 1>A male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you run into these weird issues were,</v>

1873
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really just trying to hook up?</v>

1874
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1875
01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>You can get really distracted and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get,</v>

1876
01:22:22.781 --> 01:22:27.070
<v Speaker 2>like if there's some kind of attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can forget what you're there for and</v>

1877
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.610
<v Speaker 2>get obsessed with someone and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can kind of throw off the thing</v>

1878
01:22:30.611 --> 01:22:33.280
<v Speaker 2>and there's something too about,</v>

1879
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1880
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women coming together with women and men</v>

1881
01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 2>coming together with men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I think is important.</v>

1882
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think kind of back to that tribal</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation we need,</v>

1883
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including myself,</v>

1884
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>have like beef with other women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1885
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and they don't like being around just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other women.</v>

1886
01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Like there's competition that comes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you thought,</v>

1887
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I used to because I was scared of</v>

1888
01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 2>other women because I had all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1889
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1890
01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 2>and so when you get a group of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1891
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times there is that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison and judgment and I can't</v>

1892
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>trust and did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's important for women,</v>

1893
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:10.981
<v Speaker 2>I think to gather together and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>do work separately from when there's men</v>

1894
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 2>there because there's something that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very healing just in that.</v>

1895
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1896
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a level of vulnerability that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible when there aren't men.</v>

1897
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:23.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not to say that you can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable with men there,</v>

1898
01:23:23.771 --> 01:23:26.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a different dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same goes for Matt and</v>

1899
01:23:26.231 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know man who do men's groups and men's</v>

1900
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 2>work and there's great value in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's important.</v>

1901
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the problems I see a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot in intimate relationships is that in</v>

1902
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:41.020
<v Speaker 2>a heterosexual relationship is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect this one person to be your</v>

1903
01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:44.680
<v Speaker 2>everything and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a tribe and you don't</v>

1904
01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 2>have a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have friends of the opposite</v>

1905
01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:50.980
<v Speaker 2>sex in the same sex that are fulfilling</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of these needs it that we all have.</v>

1906
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 2>We just project like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My one person has to be my everything,</v>

1907
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 2>my soulmate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1908
01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having your community,</v>

1909
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having different friends I think is</v>

1910
01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super important to having a healthy</v>

1911
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:02.944
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1912
01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having friends period is super</v>

1913
01:24:04.981 --> 01:24:06.720
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that I tweeted today</v>

1914
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:09.140
<v Speaker 1>that I was reading about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1915
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:14.180
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about the role that</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and family have in creating a</v>

1916
01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:19.221
<v Speaker 1>personality and how much of an impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>your peers have and they think that your</v>

1917
01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:24.471
<v Speaker 1>peers and the friends you choose have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger impact than anything in your</v>

1918
01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:25.374
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And it was really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1920
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted this morning for on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1921
01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those articles where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it and you go,</v>

1922
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that completely makes sense.</v>

1923
01:24:35.431 --> 01:24:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Researcher argues that peers are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more important than parents.</v>

1924
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:43.530
<v Speaker 1>That psychologist underestimate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of genetics and that we have a lot</v>

1925
01:24:43.531 --> 01:24:47.250
<v Speaker 1>to learn from Asian classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1926
01:24:47.251 --> 01:24:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about it?</v>

1927
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 1>What about Asian classrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go down,</v>

1928
01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.200
<v Speaker 1>scroll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot what that was about.</v>

1929
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably too long of an article to</v>

1930
01:24:55.241 --> 01:24:57.000
<v Speaker 1>really get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1931
01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:57.923
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to read it.</v>

1932
01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But peers in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm choosing likeminded folks</v>

1933
01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:05.850
<v Speaker 1>and choosing people that are on a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

1934
01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:06.890
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1935
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it helps support you and it supports</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you feed off of each other.</v>

1936
01:25:11.701 --> 01:25:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And when the tribe does well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do well.</v>

1937
01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very,</v>

1938
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.320
<v Speaker 1>it's very critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

1939
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to be the person that's</v>

1940
01:25:18.091 --> 01:25:20.610
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be the one,</v>

1941
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get nit and fuck the world's all</v>

1942
01:25:23.431 --> 01:25:25.500
<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do that,</v>

1943
01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.150
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

1944
01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna mess up the whole happiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1945
01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Like the happiness thing comes with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you're around having a</v>

1946
01:25:33.751 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>

1947
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:37.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's just like,</v>

1949
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:41.710
<v Speaker 2>it's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep upping the ante.</v>

1950
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what we want more than</v>

1951
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:45.820
<v Speaker 2>anything is connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1952
01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:50.170
<v Speaker 2>We want connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want love what you want to feel like</v>

1953
01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:53.140
<v Speaker 2>we belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think belonging is a huge,</v>

1954
01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:54.070
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge thing.</v>

1955
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think as adults we think we belong</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1956
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieving things.</v>

1957
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>But really it's finding those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can just be yourself</v>

1958
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 4>with and to have that tribe and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also let go of the people that are</v>

1959
01:26:07.521 --> 01:26:11.210
<v Speaker 4>bringing you down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've outgrown some people in my</v>

1960
01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 4>life and some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I'm better than,</v>

1961
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just on like a different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different path in a different route.</v>

1962
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's important I think to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>know like who's the sort of dead weight</v>

1963
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 4>and your life and what are some</v>
<v Speaker 4>friendships that might have reached</v>

1964
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 4>their expiration date that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1965
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:26.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>

1966
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 4>that's been great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1967
01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of those friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not helping them either know</v>

1968
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And matter of fact sometimes when</v>

1969
01:26:34.151 --> 01:26:35.650
<v Speaker 1>someone cuts you loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1970
01:26:35.651 --> 01:26:36.910
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

1971
01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I need to look at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1972
01:26:38.711 --> 01:26:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes when you enable a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

1973
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing yourself any good,</v>

1974
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not doing them any good either.</v>

1975
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big Aha for me when,</v>

1976
01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:52.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my fiance broke up with me because I</v>

1977
01:26:52.321 --> 01:26:54.840
<v Speaker 4>very much like want it to be like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim in that.</v>

1978
01:26:54.841 --> 01:26:56.520
<v Speaker 4>But I had to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

1979
01:26:56.521 --> 01:26:59.280
<v Speaker 4>what did I like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did I do?</v>

1980
01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.031
<v Speaker 4>Because everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1981
01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>he's such a jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>

1982
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.301
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah.</v>

1983
01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:06.301
<v Speaker 4>But I really had to look at how was I</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing up in that relationship that was</v>

1984
01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.750
<v Speaker 4>impacting his decision because he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bad guy.</v>

1985
01:27:09.751 --> 01:27:11.820
<v Speaker 4>Like he wasn't just a jerk who decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1986
01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to break up with this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there were ways I was showing up</v>

1987
01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.360
<v Speaker 4>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like made him make the decision</v>

1988
01:27:18.361 --> 01:27:20.550
<v Speaker 4>that he makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think in any of this situations,</v>

1989
01:27:20.551 --> 01:27:22.500
<v Speaker 4>friendship or relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1990
01:27:22.501 --> 01:27:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to go too far the other</v>

1991
01:27:24.121 --> 01:27:25.230
<v Speaker 4>extreme and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

1992
01:27:25.231 --> 01:27:27.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm a loser and think it's all your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>

1993
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:30.000
<v Speaker 4>But it's important to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeez,</v>

1994
01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:31.320
<v Speaker 4>what's my part in this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1995
01:27:31.321 --> 01:27:35.700
<v Speaker 4>what's my responsibility because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>played a role in this whole thing.</v>

1996
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1997
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no one way street when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to relationship.</v>

1998
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in a relationship with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad person,</v>

1999
01:27:42.361 --> 01:27:43.940
<v Speaker 1>like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why exactly,</v>

2000
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:45.570
<v Speaker 1>why did you get in that in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

2001
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And they trick you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2002
01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 1>if they did trick you ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2003
01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:50.850
<v Speaker 1>what did you do when you realize it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trek?</v>

2004
01:27:50.851 --> 01:27:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you stick around and try to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2005
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a really good question</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>

2006
01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:58.260
<v Speaker 4>how many people do you know that are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad relationships?</v>

2007
01:27:58.261 --> 01:28:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Continue talking about it but don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't doing anything about it.</v>

2008
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Like they're not brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not leaving it and it a brutal</v>

2009
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 4>are cause there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you just like,</v>

2010
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:11.850
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times it's because it's</v>

2011
01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:15.960
<v Speaker 4>familiar and it's date what there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody said,</v>

2012
01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2013
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:22.020
<v Speaker 4>you get the love you think you deserve</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it may be easy for us looking</v>

2014
01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:23.070
<v Speaker 4>outside going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

2015
01:28:23.071 --> 01:28:24.450
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should just like leave this</v>

2016
01:28:24.451 --> 01:28:26.670
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times the person like</v>

2017
01:28:26.671 --> 01:28:29.880
<v Speaker 4>doesn't think they can do better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe this is like playing out some</v>

2018
01:28:29.881 --> 01:28:31.830
<v Speaker 4>dynamic they had with their parent or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2019
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.610
<v Speaker 4>you sort of need to understand why</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in it before you can actually</v>

2020
01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:37.200
<v Speaker 4>make the choice to get out of it.</v>

2021
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.130
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of delusional people out</v>

2022
01:28:39.131 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 1>there that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deserve a lot more than I'm getting.</v>

2023
01:28:41.951 --> 01:28:43.990
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really there.</v>

2024
01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:45.970
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when someone comes to you</v>

2025
01:28:45.971 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 1>with unrealistic expectations or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to see themselves like you</v>

2026
01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:50.770
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2027
01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you tell them what they need to do or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they should consider and they argue</v>

2028
01:28:54.941 --> 01:28:55.774
<v Speaker 1>with you about it.</v>

2029
01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really ask like,</v>

2030
01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 4>is what you're doing working like is</v>
<v Speaker 4>your working?</v>

2031
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:05.080
<v Speaker 4>If you can show me your ways working</v>
<v Speaker 4>then great.</v>

2032
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:07.540
<v Speaker 1>My way's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking the other people.</v>

2033
01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is all messed up.</v>

2034
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

2035
01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to coach everyone else.</v>

2036
01:29:15.821 --> 01:29:16.654
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2037
01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we could just change other people.</v>

2038
01:29:19.391 --> 01:29:21.640
<v Speaker 4>It's everybody else's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2039
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have to tell people you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to work with them?</v>

2040
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I've had one person I had to tell that</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2041
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one and it was,</v>

2042
01:29:30.401 --> 01:29:32.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

2043
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.860
<v Speaker 4>it was just not a good fit and she just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't ready,</v>

2044
01:29:35.861 --> 01:29:39.970
<v Speaker 4>willing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The super committed to her story and</v>

2045
01:29:39.971 --> 01:29:43.450
<v Speaker 4>sort of wanted me just to cuddle it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I wasn't willing to do.</v>

2046
01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people just want someone.</v>

2047
01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've always wondered about</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

2048
01:29:46.901 --> 01:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I have friends that have been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

2049
01:29:48.251 --> 01:29:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2050
01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you go there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about your problems and then what</v>

2051
01:29:50.981 --> 01:29:51.611
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2052
01:29:51.611 --> 01:29:53.440
<v Speaker 1>they give you advice and then what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>

2053
01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:55.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2054
01:29:55.241 --> 01:29:58.540
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go somewhere and want someone to</v>

2055
01:29:58.541 --> 01:30:00.400
<v Speaker 1>listen to them talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2056
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go three,</v>

2057
01:30:02.381 --> 01:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>four times a week and they're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2058
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:05.381
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2059
01:30:05.381 --> 01:30:07.030
<v Speaker 1>well that isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2060
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.410
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't and I think my intention</v>
<v Speaker 4>always is to really give people the</v>

2061
01:30:12.411 --> 01:30:14.930
<v Speaker 4>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just advice really helped them heal</v>

2062
01:30:14.931 --> 01:30:16.760
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had amazing teachers have been</v>

2063
01:30:16.761 --> 01:30:20.030
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really lucky and they've really taught,</v>

2064
01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:23.330
<v Speaker 4>they haven't just given me advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't just given me motivation.</v>

2065
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:28.750
<v Speaker 4>They've really given me tools to heal</v>
<v Speaker 4>and change and that's,</v>

2066
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:34.450
<v Speaker 4>that's what I try to do in my work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people is show them that that a as</v>

2067
01:30:34.791 --> 01:30:38.930
<v Speaker 4>possible and they and that it can do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and give them the tools to do it because</v>

2068
01:30:38.931 --> 01:30:41.410
<v Speaker 4>that's what that's going to last longer</v>
<v Speaker 4>than any kind of like</v>

2069
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.940
<v Speaker 1>pep talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>

2070
01:30:42.941 --> 01:30:46.330
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>started about going to a seminar and</v>

2071
01:30:46.331 --> 01:30:51.331
<v Speaker 1>someone asking how many men here feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and like no one's putting</v>

2072
01:30:52.061 --> 01:30:54.580
<v Speaker 1>their hand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many women here feel vulnerable?</v>

2073
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.250
<v Speaker 1>All the hands went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the hands went up.</v>

2074
01:30:57.970 --> 01:31:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it I think is a little</v>

2075
01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:03.310
<v Speaker 1>delusional because I think a lot of men</v>
<v Speaker 1>are way more vulnerable than they really</v>

2076
01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:06.730
<v Speaker 1>think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also this does just a different</v>

2077
01:31:06.731 --> 01:31:11.050
<v Speaker 1>thing going through live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's that expression,</v>

2078
01:31:11.051 --> 01:31:13.840
<v Speaker 1>the fair sex or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a female,</v>

2079
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:16.510
<v Speaker 1>being a woman means you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're physically different.</v>

2080
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're up a bunch of people that most of</v>

2081
01:31:20.381 --> 01:31:22.510
<v Speaker 1>them could beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2082
01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2083
01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a different way to walk through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2084
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That vulnerability though is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates another level of anxiety,</v>

2085
01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:33.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like walking down a dark street,</v>

2086
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you see someone and it's a man and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking down the dark street too.</v>

2087
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:39.743
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2088
01:31:40.150 --> 01:31:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2089
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:41.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2090
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:45.590
<v Speaker 4>it's scary and it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2091
01:31:45.591 --> 01:31:48.740
<v Speaker 4>I as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm always aware of it.</v>

2092
01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Not always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of the time,</v>

2093
01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>

2094
01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.630
<v Speaker 4>I know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2095
01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.500
<v Speaker 4>I could get beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2096
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:58.910
<v Speaker 4>it's between me and a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably going to,</v>

2097
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm pretty strong but</v>

2098
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.950
<v Speaker 2>not that strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2099
01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I think what's also beautiful about</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and just the feminine in general</v>

2100
01:32:05.981 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>is that vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because like at sometimes it has,</v>

2101
01:32:08.951 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 2>it feels safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why a lot of women like</v>

2102
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>kind of have a protective armor and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>guarded and sometimes more on there like</v>

2103
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>masculine energy in the world is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some level we feel like we have to,</v>

2104
01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>we have to like protect ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas that,</v>

2105
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>that vulnerability you really is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that makes us women in so many</v>

2106
01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>ways not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we confuse vulnerability</v>

2107
01:32:29.771 --> 01:32:34.771
<v Speaker 2>with weakness because vulnerability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me is being open,</v>

2108
01:32:35.891 --> 01:32:38.510
<v Speaker 2>being available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being um,</v>

2109
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:43.720
<v Speaker 2>soft but not weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weakness to me is more about kind of</v>

2110
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 2>going into the victim me and going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that poor pitiful me and the feeling</v>

2111
01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:50.140
<v Speaker 2>sorry for and on all of those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2112
01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I think there's beautiful power and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>

2113
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 2>but when we're talking about just</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical strength,</v>

2114
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:58.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for the most part men have the</v>

2115
01:32:58.451 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 2>advantage on that one.</v>

2116
01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just we need all the pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2117
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You need the whole spectrum of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

2118
01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean?</v>

2119
01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Especially in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2120
01:33:11.511 --> 01:33:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you did the traditional way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at things.</v>

2121
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine men are attracted to feminine</v>

2122
01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 1>women and Feminine Women are attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to masculine men and we both need each</v>

2123
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.410
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of times,</v>

2124
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:25.750
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged folks,</v>

2125
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a man who has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable woman and the man's all</v>

2126
01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:33.670
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he takes it out on a vulnerable</v>

2127
01:33:33.671 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the vulnerable woman is like under</v>

2128
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2129
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pressure of the relationship or the</v>

2130
01:33:41.501 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 1>suppression of being connected to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2131
01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you kind of dealing with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic that you were dealing with when</v>

2132
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you were in school or someone's bullying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you get it in this relationship.</v>

2133
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Then instead of someone appreciating you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the difference in the softness</v>

2134
01:33:56.591 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 1>versus the hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yin and the Yang,</v>

2135
01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 1>now you have someone who is exploiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2136
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see it with women too and they</v>

2137
01:34:03.461 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 1>see it with like aggressive women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak men.</v>

2138
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2139
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:10.090
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the saddest things I ever see is</v>

2140
01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:14.470
<v Speaker 1>when you find the aggressive women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weak man cut.</v>

2141
01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Probably because I'm terrified of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever being mean.</v>

2142
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will be.</v>

2143
01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:19.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2144
01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2145
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants the woman who's yelling at</v>

2146
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Ya and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes,</v>

2147
01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:27.480
<v Speaker 1>we go cuckoo cuckoo.</v>

2148
01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I that happens a lot and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2149
01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

2150
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda crazy to me because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2151
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I see women emasculate men quite often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2152
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.360
<v Speaker 2>not maybe on like a huge scale to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree you're talking about,</v>

2153
01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:46.450
<v Speaker 2>but just like the little comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll be out with a couple and the</v>

2154
01:34:46.451 --> 01:34:50.740
<v Speaker 2>woman will say something and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of emasculating burn.</v>

2155
01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:54.700
<v Speaker 2>If the roles were reversed and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>said something like that to the woman,</v>

2156
01:34:54.701 --> 01:34:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it would go over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2157
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>guys just kind of take it</v>

2158
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>on on sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I see that,</v>

2159
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of men feel emasculated by</v>

2160
01:35:04.671 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>society in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by the roles that they play in the</v>

2161
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2162
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:10.140
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2163
01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:15.150
<v Speaker 1>the physical act of going through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's civilized world and also constantly</v>

2164
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:21.371
<v Speaker 1>needing people's affirmation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needing people's acceptance.</v>

2165
01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

2166
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you sort of become what people want you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

2167
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:30.270
<v Speaker 1>even if that's not what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get in these relationships and you</v>

2168
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>see it all the time where a guy sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept a little bit and then they accept</v>

2169
01:35:34.431 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>more and then they don't want to mess</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2170
01:35:36.381 --> 01:35:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of friends that have like</v>

2171
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:42.440
<v Speaker 1>really domineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overbearing wives or girlfriends.</v>

2172
01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to be around them.</v>

2173
01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:45.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2174
01:35:45.381 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can leave.</v>

2175
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just like,</v>

2176
01:35:47.661 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 1>this is just a person.</v>

2177
01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they're scared,</v>

2178
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>they're scared and it becomes the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2179
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

2180
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:56.800
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or go out of the fucking wife,</v>

2181
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:58.400
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go home to the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2182
01:35:58.401 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2183
01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange when you have someone</v>

2184
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.150
<v Speaker 1>in your life that's essentially like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parole officer,</v>

2185
01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 1>so many life that gets to tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and you're not allowed to do</v>

2186
01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:10.940
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to watch certain</v>

2187
01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:14.600
<v Speaker 1>things or like certain things and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>control you and they own you.</v>

2188
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2189
01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:20.990
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing that much like the girl who</v>

2190
01:36:20.991 --> 01:36:23.630
<v Speaker 1>bullied you or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who does that to someone,</v>

2191
01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:26.180
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it out of,</v>

2192
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.850
<v Speaker 1>out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it at an insecurity and they</v>

2193
01:36:28.851 --> 01:36:31.730
<v Speaker 1>also do it out of this bizarre instinct</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can,</v>

2194
01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I state this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a bad person,</v>

2195
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but she used to like to fight and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2196
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.903
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

2197
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I do not like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that kind of conflict.</v>

2198
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a relationship conflict.</v>

2199
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

2200
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't fight and argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just rather leave.</v>

2201
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll end.</v>

2202
01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm into discussing things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people start yelling and get</v>

2203
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:50.211
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2204
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

2205
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I grew up around domestic violence too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with the,</v>

2206
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.880
<v Speaker 1>so I saw it when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2207
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2208
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 1>so we broke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we stayed friends and then years</v>

2209
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:06.550
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2210
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:08.600
<v Speaker 1>we went out to coffee and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's everything?</v>

2211
01:37:08.601 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2212
01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm living this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going good.</v>

2213
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:11.931
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2214
01:37:11.931 --> 01:37:14.750
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's telling me how she yells at this</v>

2215
01:37:14.751 --> 01:37:17.120
<v Speaker 1>guy and she can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2216
01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking yell at him and he</v>

2217
01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:21.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything.</v>

2218
01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:23.540
<v Speaker 1>He just takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2219
01:37:23.541 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 1>when he takes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to fucking smash him.</v>

2220
01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't,</v>

2221
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to yell at them,</v>

2222
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he's gone,</v>

2223
01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did I do that?</v>

2224
01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And she had this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a natural impulse to</v>

2225
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:41.900
<v Speaker 1>dominate this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you ever seen two dogs,</v>

2226
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:46.880
<v Speaker 1>one dog has the upper hand on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dog and he'll go near the dog and</v>

2227
01:37:46.881 --> 01:37:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the other dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just,</v>

2228
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.840
<v Speaker 1>that's just their world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just their world.</v>

2229
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:54.830
<v Speaker 1>But the other dog never gets a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's not even a size based</v>

2230
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it might be the exact same size</v>

2231
01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:59.370
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one dog just decides the bitch and</v>

2232
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:01.790
<v Speaker 1>the other one's the dominator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it goes.</v>

2233
01:38:01.810 --> 01:38:02.401
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2234
01:38:02.401 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 1>she was in this position with this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she just had this compelling</v>

2235
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.330
<v Speaker 1>desire to fucking yell at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

2236
01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:10.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you yelling at him for her?</v>

2237
01:38:10.581 --> 01:38:11.610
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2238
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2239
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking,</v>

2240
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I want him to tell me to shut the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2241
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted him to out manner.</v>

2242
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that crazy?</v>

2243
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Like what a bizarre instinct to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2244
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:27.900
<v Speaker 1>to push and like she was frustrated at</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>

2245
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 1>She was frustrated at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like she was compelled,</v>

2246
01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's being drawn to the great magnet,</v>

2247
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2248
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

2249
01:38:36.031 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna scream at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2250
01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting like how we project on</v>

2251
01:38:40.421 --> 01:38:41.800
<v Speaker 4>to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2252
01:38:41.801 --> 01:38:44.140
<v Speaker 4>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them was going on inside of her</v>

2253
01:38:44.141 --> 01:38:46.660
<v Speaker 4>that was like creating that dynamic in</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2254
01:38:46.661 --> 01:38:49.750
<v Speaker 4>And she could have left at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like she was so trying to get</v>

2255
01:38:49.751 --> 01:38:54.100
<v Speaker 4>a reaction out of him honestly to</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably see if he cared.</v>

2256
01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Like she probably equated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2257
01:38:55.871 --> 01:38:57.820
<v Speaker 4>well him taking it means he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>

2258
01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:00.310
<v Speaker 4>So how much can I push?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much can I push?</v>

2259
01:39:00.311 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 4>How can I match?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I push so that I can see that he,</v>

2260
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.140
<v Speaker 4>he'll react enough cause that means,</v>

2261
01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:06.590
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That she didn't think he cares if you</v>

2262
01:39:06.591 --> 01:39:09.590
<v Speaker 1>think she just thinks he's weak and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just frustrating to her that he's weak?</v>

2263
01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Well if it was just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she would have left a lot</v>

2264
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.140
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something she wanted.</v>

2265
01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't keep doing it over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again unless there's</v>

2266
01:39:18.341 --> 01:39:20.380
<v Speaker 4>something more attached to getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2267
01:39:20.410 --> 01:39:22.150
<v Speaker 4>you know when we're just went and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2268
01:39:22.151 --> 01:39:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is stupid.</v>

2269
01:39:23.051 --> 01:39:26.350
<v Speaker 4>We get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when we find ourselves in situations</v>

2270
01:39:26.351 --> 01:39:29.680
<v Speaker 4>where it's like it's happening over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again and we continue to</v>

2271
01:39:29.681 --> 01:39:33.100
<v Speaker 4>get frustrated but we're not leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something we're attached to</v>

2272
01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:37.300
<v Speaker 4>trying to get from our behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was something she wanted and</v>

2273
01:39:37.301 --> 01:39:39.700
<v Speaker 4>that there was something in it for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise she had been out of there a</v>

2274
01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:40.534
<v Speaker 4>lot sooner.</v>

2275
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also,</v>

2276
01:39:42.141 --> 01:39:45.860
<v Speaker 1>she was trying to do the acting thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was constantly frustrated.</v>

2277
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was constantly just taking it out on</v>

2278
01:39:48.621 --> 01:39:49.340
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2279
01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Well that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really interesting.</v>

2280
01:39:52.821 --> 01:39:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd watch these like almost sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic things.</v>

2281
01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Like there would be these moments where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2282
01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.600
<v Speaker 1>she would be preparing for an audition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she'd be hopeful yet nervous.</v>

2283
01:40:02.601 --> 01:40:04.580
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of anxiety and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

2284
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing and it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things going to go on the,</v>

2285
01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 1>hopefully if this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is connected to this and that's</v>

2286
01:40:09.981 --> 01:40:12.950
<v Speaker 1>going to happen with that and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen.</v>

2287
01:40:12.951 --> 01:40:14.960
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this massive let down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2288
01:40:14.961 --> 01:40:18.530
<v Speaker 1>This is cigarette smoking and depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2289
01:40:18.531 --> 01:40:20.210
<v Speaker 1>all this angst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2290
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the fuck out of there.</v>

2291
01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dude got in there like,</v>

2292
01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and he caught it.</v>

2293
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:31.400
<v Speaker 1>He caught the second wave of anx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>When I met her she was just moving here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2295
01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And so she wasn't completely bewildered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the experience in the machine yet.</v>

2296
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2297
01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:43.790
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for some people choosing things</v>

2298
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:47.240
<v Speaker 1>that you do for a living that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy for you.</v>

2299
01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that get</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in careers that require too</v>

2300
01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:54.610
<v Speaker 1>much of their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really want to do it,</v>

2301
01:40:54.611 --> 01:40:57.400
<v Speaker 1>but you get caught up in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's being a lawyer or being a</v>

2302
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>doctor or being something that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prestigious title when you feel like</v>

2303
01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:04.030
<v Speaker 1>there's something great tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really in the back of your mind,</v>

2304
01:41:04.031 --> 01:41:07.270
<v Speaker 1>there's something else that you probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be way happier doing.</v>

2305
01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going after it for the wrong</v>

2306
01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do though?</v>

2307
01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't doing the life coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you enjoy doing what you're</v>

2308
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:16.780
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you have like if somehow or</v>

2309
01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:20.140
<v Speaker 1>another you were independently wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't have to coach all these</v>

2310
01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:20.630
<v Speaker 1>crazy people?</v>

2311
01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Plenty more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that they're crazy,</v>

2312
01:41:22.611 --> 01:41:25.940
<v Speaker 4>but some of them will probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I,</v>

2313
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:31.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love people and I love personal</v>

2314
01:41:31.191 --> 01:41:32.930
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if I had all the money in the</v>

2315
01:41:32.931 --> 01:41:34.550
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd still speak.</v>

2316
01:41:34.551 --> 01:41:37.580
<v Speaker 4>I'd still do my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd still do retreats.</v>

2317
01:41:37.581 --> 01:41:39.770
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2318
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Like I love the human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love being there for that moment where</v>

2319
01:41:43.761 --> 01:41:47.240
<v Speaker 4>someone has a major insight where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>connect dots and it's like,</v>

2320
01:41:47.241 --> 01:41:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive perspective shift and like all</v>

2321
01:41:50.091 --> 01:41:53.030
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden they start to kind of move a</v>
<v Speaker 4>different direction.</v>

2322
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.970
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine doing anything else.</v>

2323
01:41:55.971 --> 01:41:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I could sing,</v>

2324
01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:00.350
<v Speaker 4>if I had any kind of music ability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it'd be awesome to be a</v>

2325
01:42:00.351 --> 01:42:02.210
<v Speaker 4>rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just to have that rush.</v>

2326
01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:07.660
<v Speaker 4>But literally I have no musical ability</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever other than like listening to</v>

2327
01:42:08.031 --> 01:42:09.360
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just do not have,</v>

2328
01:42:09.361 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2329
01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Well that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you found your thing.</v>

2330
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often is it when you talk to be,</v>

2331
01:42:13.171 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 1>but when you're trying to coach them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them and you realize like,</v>

2332
01:42:15.881 --> 01:42:18.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do something else.</v>

2333
01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Like is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a factor?</v>

2334
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause I would think that the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers is not only is it eight hours of</v>

2335
01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:26.470
<v Speaker 1>your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also kind of defines you.</v>

2336
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 1>So every day you're defined by whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

2337
01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes,</v>

2338
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about like men in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these workplace environments,</v>

2339
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're boxed into this predetermined</v>

2340
01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:39.520
<v Speaker 1>pattern and behavior that's expected</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>

2341
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have shoes with tassels on them and</v>

2342
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 1>ties and they have to talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2343
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 1>business talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you fall into these weird</v>

2344
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 1>patterns and you lose a lot of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality inside those patterns</v>

2345
01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:56.821
<v Speaker 1>because office life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human resources demands certain things</v>

2346
01:42:57.161 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>

2347
01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a certain your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality,</v>

2348
01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 1>like when you in an office environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're in the corporate world,</v>

2349
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 1>your personality is stuffed into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

2350
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2351
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever that form is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that mold is,</v>

2352
01:43:13.751 --> 01:43:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the mold of being a business person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2353
01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a woman,</v>

2354
01:43:17.561 --> 01:43:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a business woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be respected and want to use</v>

2355
01:43:20.351 --> 01:43:22.430
<v Speaker 1>the right word to say the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

2356
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2357
01:43:23.150 --> 01:43:27.190
<v Speaker 1>and talk the right lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did the,</v>

2358
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.700
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times people are left</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering who the fuck am I.</v>

2359
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2360
01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.560
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just get totally lost in a role.</v>

2361
01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:36.860
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do like I go do a lot of corporate</v>

2362
01:43:36.861 --> 01:43:40.130
<v Speaker 4>speaking and I have a lot of people come</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to me afterwards and they're just</v>

2363
01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:41.480
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh.</v>

2364
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm cause I talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2365
01:43:44.211 --> 01:43:48.230
<v Speaker 4>how we lose ourselves in these roles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>how like a lot of times our adult life</v>

2366
01:43:48.231 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 4>becomes sort of just this like follow</v>

2367
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Truman show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one thing after the other,</v>

2368
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>just like follow this structure that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>set out for us.</v>

2369
01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 2>We never checked in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I want this?</v>

2370
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Like do I even want this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2371
01:44:01.911 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>And so to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2372
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:06.770
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times when people come or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with people,</v>

2373
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:09.270
<v Speaker 2>it is like looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this cool?</v>

2374
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Is this career right for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this relationship right for you?</v>

2375
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you created in your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't fit where you are?</v>

2376
01:44:15.321 --> 01:44:17.510
<v Speaker 2>But you're in it because you're scared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the change.</v>

2377
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.831
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>

2378
01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people really can be happy in</v>

2379
01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:23.870
<v Speaker 2>corporate America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people</v>

2380
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:26.870
<v Speaker 1>that works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're strange freaks,</v>

2381
01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:27.381
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2382
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I firmly really believe that the vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of people that are living the</v>

2383
01:44:31.821 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 1>American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living that life,</v>

2384
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 1>doing that nine to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them are fucking</v>

2385
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.580
<v Speaker 1>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrifically miserable.</v>

2386
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that.</v>

2387
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:47.411
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so defining and it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so contrary to the human spirit.</v>

2388
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2389
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And I think most people don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that.</v>

2390
01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to believe there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that everybody's doing</v>

2391
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2392
01:44:54.710 --> 01:44:56.490
<v Speaker 2>And they don't believe they can change</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2393
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other option.</v>

2394
01:44:58.301 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they have,</v>

2395
01:45:00.021 --> 01:45:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mortgage and a spouse and kids doing</v>

2396
01:45:02.661 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 2>loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2397
01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really intimidating to go,</v>

2398
01:45:06.471 --> 01:45:07.460
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>

2399
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.460
<v Speaker 2>how do I change this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to start small.</v>

2400
01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2401
01:45:12.741 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to quit my job tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are some things in my life I</v>

2402
01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:18.620
<v Speaker 2>can start doing that made me feel alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

2403
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Like is it a hobby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like training for a marathon?</v>

2404
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it what is going to start making me</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>

2405
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:27.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm creative and I matter and I'm more</v>

2406
01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 2>than just this role as husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>

2407
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:30.681
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

2408
01:45:30.681 --> 01:45:33.020
<v Speaker 2>corporate executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2409
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a good place to start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something small you can do to make</v>

2410
01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you feel alive again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because anybody has access to that,</v>

2411
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2412
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:43.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to leave your job to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start creating some things in your life</v>

2413
01:45:43.701 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 2>that can start to shift things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like we were talking about then</v>

2414
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like the gradual change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2415
01:45:48.741 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't think it's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people just to quit their job</v>

2416
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think it's possible.</v>

2417
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:55.130
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost no one.</v>

2418
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not everybody's meant to be an</v>

2419
01:45:57.141 --> 01:45:59.300
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur either and do their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2420
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:04.330
<v Speaker 2>but there are always things we can do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our life to mix it up a little bit and</v>

2421
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 2>even just show up differently in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2422
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that for a huge amount of</v>

2423
01:46:10.981 --> 01:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of time that's required of</v>

2424
01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:14.670
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Because of their job is so overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people,</v>

2426
01:46:19.381 --> 01:46:22.980
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest or not really just</v>
<v Speaker 1>working nine to five particularly most</v>

2427
01:46:22.981 --> 01:46:25.110
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of overtime</v>

2428
01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.680
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at the,</v>

2429
01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:28.550
<v Speaker 1>some thing there was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

2430
01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:30.780
<v Speaker 1>an article on the wage gap difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

2431
01:46:30.781 --> 01:46:33.720
<v Speaker 1>what it really is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things it was about was</v>

2432
01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the amount of the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of hours that men work and the in</v>

2433
01:46:37.351 --> 01:46:40.110
<v Speaker 1>their ambition to try to climb up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate ladder.</v>

2434
01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the numbers that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and it's terrifying.</v>

2435
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're working 60 hours a week,</v>

2436
01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left.</v>

2437
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I work here,</v>

2438
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a podcast for three hours and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a bunch of other stuff and you</v>

2439
01:46:55.921 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fit in things in my day</v>

2440
01:46:57.901 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and I have a pretty loose schedule.</v>

2441
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of things,</v>

2442
01:47:00.901 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2443
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 1>like today I did UFC stuff for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours this morning and then I come here</v>

2444
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:09.720
<v Speaker 1>for a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I got to work out and then it will</v>

2445
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>tell some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of movement in there.</v>

2446
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of time or I can get shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

2447
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't have any of that.</v>

2448
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:21.740
<v Speaker 1>It have nothing like that made you</v>
<v Speaker 1>different like back in the day where you</v>

2449
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 1>could have done that path of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate route.</v>

2450
01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Why did you make different choices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

2451
01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.473
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>

2452
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2453
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never felt like I could,</v>

2454
01:47:35.650 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I never felt like I could have a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2455
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Like from the time I got out of high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

2456
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I never had a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bunch of part time jobs.</v>

2457
01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I did some full time jobs where</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction companies and stuff,</v>

2458
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do them for like a month or a</v>

2459
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and I was like fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2460
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all,</v>

2461
01:47:55.770 --> 01:48:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it was the main source</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all my problems in high school.</v>

2462
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:06.720
<v Speaker 1>All my problems in high school was I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not willing to do things I didn't want</v>

2463
01:48:06.721 --> 01:48:09.570
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would barely get by through high</v>

2464
01:48:09.571 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go take tests.</v>

2465
01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.970
<v Speaker 1>They would register intelligence or</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure intelligence.</v>

2466
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:16.320
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

2467
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.060
<v Speaker 1>But I would take actual test based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was supposed to be studying and I</v>

2468
01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking barely paid attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I s squoze through high school</v>

2469
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 1>with like a c average and most things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely got by.</v>

2470
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And even when I was going to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was only going to college.</v>

2471
01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I went to Boston University and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or umass rather in Boston.</v>

2472
01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason why I went is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want anybody to think I</v>

2473
01:48:39.781 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 1>was a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking classes at Umass and</v>

2474
01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:43.323
<v Speaker 1>busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2475
01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:46.290
<v Speaker 1>when I was teaching taekwondo at Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>

2476
01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:50.580
<v Speaker 1>which was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good school and I was looking</v>

2477
01:48:50.581 --> 01:48:54.900
<v Speaker 1>at all these people that were preparing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life and to me it was like,</v>

2478
01:48:54.901 --> 01:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get eaten by alligators or something.</v>

2479
01:48:57.011 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

2480
01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be working nine to five</v>

2481
01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.570
<v Speaker 1>for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever fucked up thing that was wrong</v>

2482
01:49:03.571 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would way rather get up in the morning</v>

2483
01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and deliver newspapers for three hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day or drive limos at night.</v>

2484
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really unstable childhood.</v>

2485
01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you were locked down to</v>

2486
01:49:16.501 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 1>was death.</v>

2487
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It was prison and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever malfunction of my brain,</v>

2488
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to make it work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival skill.</v>

2489
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some way,</v>

2490
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 1>but also a lack of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very disciplined.</v>

2491
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:34.260
<v Speaker 1>It looks like I'm disciplined on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

2492
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disciplined at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed.</v>

2493
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I get obsessed with things whether I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined with in certain aspects like</v>

2494
01:49:40.111 --> 01:49:42.450
<v Speaker 1>with exercise and I do it when I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do it.</v>

2495
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to practice and I forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to write.</v>

2496
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more of,</v>

2497
01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>it's more of an obsession thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I get obsessed with either a goals</v>

2498
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:58.770
<v Speaker 1>or tasks or things or puzzles or games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've have a real problem,</v>

2499
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 1>like there's something wrong with me.</v>

2500
01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you say that?</v>

2501
01:50:02.791 --> 01:50:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel draining?</v>

2502
01:50:04.050 --> 01:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I'll play pool for 12 hours</v>

2503
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

2504
01:50:07.991 --> 01:50:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll get obsessed with playing pool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think I'm going to be the world</v>

2505
01:50:10.511 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to practice 12 hours a day for</v>

2506
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2507
01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sick person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever happened to me when I was</v>

2508
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever weirdness in involved in</v>

2509
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to manage it,</v>

2510
01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but it can get away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten away from me before.</v>

2511
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played video games like eight,</v>

2512
01:50:27.521 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can get away.</v>

2513
01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to manage whatever craziness that</v>

2514
01:50:33.281 --> 01:50:35.740
<v Speaker 1>makes me like focus on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I see it in my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially my middle daughter,</v>

2516
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.500
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets obsessed with things and I'm</v>

2517
01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:41.951
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2518
01:50:41.951 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a genetic thing.</v>

2519
01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:46.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a little female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and a lot of ways,</v>

2520
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she read all eight Harry Potter</v>

2521
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 1>books and a matter of a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

2522
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:55.110
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is just gets into stuff and then</v>

2523
01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:55.871
<v Speaker 1>like you got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2524
01:50:55.871 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 1>shut the light out.</v>

2525
01:50:56.530 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to bed one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter.</v>

2526
01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.451
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2527
01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2528
01:51:00.461 --> 01:51:02.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like she's seen it in me and</v>

2529
01:51:02.651 --> 01:51:06.400
<v Speaker 1>she's mirroring it because it's her own</v>
<v Speaker 1>little weirdness,</v>

2530
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's obviously she's got a,</v>

2531
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a healthier environment than I grew up</v>

2532
01:51:11.381 --> 01:51:12.640
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like a,</v>

2533
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 1>a matter of luck not ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ever wanting to be connected to</v>

2534
01:51:17.471 --> 01:51:19.120
<v Speaker 1>anything permanent cause nothing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>

2535
01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with the lessons from my</v>

2536
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one's here to help you.</v>

2537
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Not as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get locked in any fucking job.</v>

2538
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't get locked in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get ready to move in any time,</v>

2539
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and embracing moving.</v>

2540
01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Like to this day I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

2541
01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get the fuck on la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2542
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:35.470
<v Speaker 1>everything's here.</v>

2543
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I have to do everything here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comic stores here,</v>

2544
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 1>my family's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids go to school here.</v>

2545
01:51:39.311 --> 01:51:40.750
<v Speaker 1>All my friends live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like,</v>

2546
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:41.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the mountains.</v>

2547
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have this like no mad shit in me</v>

2548
01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:48.130
<v Speaker 1>that I'm like constantly trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2549
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.500
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>

2550
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as people like to take credit</v>

2551
01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 1>for a certain amount of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can tell you all the different</v>

2552
01:51:57.881 --> 01:52:00.760
<v Speaker 1>things that I did that led to me being</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at things,</v>

2553
01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the function of a mental</v>

2554
01:52:04.631 --> 01:52:06.220
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big,</v>

2555
01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.400
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is a function of learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to manage a brain that doesn't work</v>

2556
01:52:12.641 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else's brain.</v>

2557
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:20.890
<v Speaker 2>That's so I think common for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful people especially,</v>

2558
01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:24.940
<v Speaker 2>and the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of how it works and you've</v>

2559
01:52:24.941 --> 01:52:27.100
<v Speaker 2>learned how to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

2560
01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that obsessive thing in so many ways it</v>

2561
01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:33.220
<v Speaker 2>has made you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has gotten you a certain degree of</v>

2562
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 2>success and all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival skills,</v>

2563
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 2>compensatory strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>

2564
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:41.590
<v Speaker 2>they have their positives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have ways that they really help us,</v>

2565
01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 2>but then they have the ways that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>torture us and a lot of ways.</v>

2566
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>

2567
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.970
<v Speaker 4>growth is really about understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the ways that this isn't doing</v>

2568
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 4>me any good and how can I be mindful of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2569
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 4>And also like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2570
01:52:55.250 --> 01:53:00.250
<v Speaker 4>how do I know now that like that now is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not then like how do I,</v>

2571
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:03.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop being activated by old experiences</v>

2572
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:08.951
<v Speaker 4>in my past and just have peace for where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am now and take those gifts from the</v>

2573
01:53:09.801 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 4>obsession that's made you successful but</v>
<v Speaker 4>not having the parts that kind of</v>

2574
01:53:13.281 --> 01:53:13.960
<v Speaker 4>torture you at the same</v>

2575
01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2576
01:53:14.890 --> 01:53:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel tortured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2577
01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:20.830
<v Speaker 1>so I think in some ways have achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a victory over my whatever</v>

2578
01:53:20.831 --> 01:53:24.130
<v Speaker 1>mental issues that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do nothing.</v>

2579
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why I have three jobs</v>

2580
01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do nothing if I do an end.</v>

2581
01:53:31.331 --> 01:53:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I have three jobs and a fucking ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessions outside of those jobs.</v>

2582
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery or reading and writing and all</v>

2583
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.380
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other stuff on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting and doing the commentary for</v>

2584
01:53:44.381 --> 01:53:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing standup comedy,</v>

2585
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.850
<v Speaker 1>like that's the only way I feel even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2586
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and I can't have one thing that I count</v>
<v Speaker 1>on either if like I had,</v>

2587
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:57.160
<v Speaker 1>if I only had standup comedy or only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

2588
01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:59.680
<v Speaker 1>if there's only one thing or only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting,</v>

2589
01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>

2590
01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to quit.</v>

2591
01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

2592
01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:06.790
<v Speaker 1>This is my fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be trapped doing this</v>

2593
01:54:06.791 --> 01:54:09.160
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking into a fucking microphone out</v>

2594
01:54:09.161 --> 01:54:11.920
<v Speaker 1>into space for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to fucking,</v>

2595
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to hear myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2596
01:54:13.421 --> 01:54:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I've got to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2597
01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So whatever weird malfunction my brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

2598
01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I've figured out a way over all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of my life to,</v>

2599
01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:26.920
<v Speaker 1>to manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of his physical to managing my</v>

2600
01:54:26.921 --> 01:54:30.640
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it requires intense exercise.</v>

2601
01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I intensely exercise,</v>

2602
01:54:33.281 --> 01:54:34.350
<v Speaker 1>then I can like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2603
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:36.770
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be all right.</v>

2604
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I don't,</v>

2605
01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all built up and then</v>

2606
01:54:41.931 --> 01:54:43.570
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to enjoy things.</v>

2607
01:54:43.571 --> 01:54:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to just chill.</v>

2608
01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't chill unless I earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets a,</v>

2609
01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:54.670
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a malfunction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the illusion is that it's not,</v>

2610
01:54:54.671 --> 01:54:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the illusion is that it's a discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's all,</v>

2611
01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it's all choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's really not the case.</v>

2612
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.370
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just you and how you operate</v>
<v Speaker 4>your operating system.</v>

2613
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Are You coaching me now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on here?</v>

2614
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Does that feel like I am?</v>

2615
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is me.</v>

2616
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

2617
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:16.770
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2618
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there,</v>

2619
01:55:18.241 --> 01:55:22.440
<v Speaker 4>I back to the acceptance thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of ways I think we're</v>

2620
01:55:22.441 --> 01:55:26.130
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be and we look at other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and how they do their life for</v>

2621
01:55:26.131 --> 01:55:28.140
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we think that because we're acting</v>

2622
01:55:28.141 --> 01:55:29.730
<v Speaker 4>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something must be wrong with us,</v>

2623
01:55:29.731 --> 01:55:33.570
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just the way you operate.</v>

2624
01:55:33.730 --> 01:55:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what another thing is</v>

2625
01:55:35.771 --> 01:55:37.470
<v Speaker 1>interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2626
01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.720
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid I was a not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident and also didn't like to talk</v>

2627
01:55:43.201 --> 01:55:44.910
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get anxiety,</v>

2628
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a talk and I get anxiety,</v>

2629
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:50.380
<v Speaker 1>if I had to like talk to a bank teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2630
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I had to wait in line through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backdoor.</v>

2631
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd start freaking out like on my way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bank teller.</v>

2632
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And like if you talked to like people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew me from high school and they'll</v>

2633
01:55:59.101 --> 01:56:00.000
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2634
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:02.280
<v Speaker 1>did you ever think that Joe is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a comedian?</v>

2635
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2636
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was at funny,</v>

2637
01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to be more relaxed</v>

2638
01:56:11.071 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>socially and it wasn't an easy process</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2639
01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It took forever to the point where now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm extremely relaxed socially.</v>

2640
01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Like now I can talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2641
01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I love one of the things I love about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing podcasts.</v>

2642
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I like just having conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2643
01:56:25.351 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know like you're another</v>

2644
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 1>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're another person.</v>

2645
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what's going on in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2646
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

2647
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to own to try to see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections you've made,</v>

2648
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:39.990
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what definitions you've fallen on.</v>

2649
01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>

2650
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 1>how you've defined this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you've,</v>

2651
01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.800
<v Speaker 1>how you've categorized things and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're managing it.</v>

2652
01:56:46.801 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you maneuvering through it?</v>

2653
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the,</v>

2654
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:55.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts that people carry around</v>

2655
01:56:55.111 --> 01:56:56.340
<v Speaker 1>inside their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2656
01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:58.110
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2657
01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not they're empowering or</v>

2658
01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:03.210
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're a woe is me type</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2659
01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2660
01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And what are the puzzle pieces that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>led to where you are?</v>

2661
01:57:07.611 --> 01:57:10.490
<v Speaker 2>And I love that you're sharing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think a lot of people can see</v>

2662
01:57:10.491 --> 01:57:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you and see your success in everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have and thank you were always</v>

2663
01:57:15.021 --> 01:57:17.480
<v Speaker 2>like this and then it's just been easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's this,</v>

2664
01:57:17.481 --> 01:57:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always like this,</v>

2665
01:57:18.471 --> 01:57:22.400
<v Speaker 2>but to know you had that background and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had the social anxiety and this is</v>

2666
01:57:22.401 --> 01:57:26.720
<v Speaker 2>like such a stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really inspiring because it</v>

2667
01:57:26.721 --> 01:57:28.010
<v Speaker 2>gives people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2668
01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.000
<v Speaker 2>oh you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2669
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you can no longer argue that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just born a certain way and</v>

2670
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:37.880
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your proof that you actually can</v>

2671
01:57:37.881 --> 01:57:41.630
<v Speaker 2>change and you can't get over things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can create things that you know you</v>

2672
01:57:41.631 --> 01:57:44.810
<v Speaker 2>probably didn't think were possible when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were 10 or however old you were when</v>

2673
01:57:44.811 --> 01:57:45.920
<v Speaker 2>you were going through all that stuff.</v>

2674
01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are,</v>

2675
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 1>people have different starting points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2676
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:54.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was saying that if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to climb Mount Everest,</v>

2677
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:55.920
<v Speaker 1>good luck of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting from Santa Monica.</v>

2678
01:57:55.921 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 1>You got to fucking walk all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tibet.</v>

2679
01:57:58.150 --> 01:57:59.950
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2680
01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:01.130
<v Speaker 1>the ocean is going to be hard to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grip,</v>

2681
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but if you're at the base of Tibet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's where you live,</v>

2682
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it's w or the base of the Himalayas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to climb that thing,</v>

2683
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still not easy,</v>

2684
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:14.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of people that</v>

2685
01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:15.300
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2686
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:19.410
<v Speaker 1>in the a metaphoric Santa Monica would</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>

2687
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.660
<v Speaker 1>they're really far away from their goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that there's a bunch of</v>

2689
01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:26.670
<v Speaker 1>steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're conscious or unconscious</v>

2690
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.940
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to have to make in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get to a position.</v>

2691
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And I still remember fucking freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out going to a bank teller.</v>

2692
01:58:33.930 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I think we used to have an all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to talk to people.</v>

2693
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I was just in my own head and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>super insecure and I just could barely</v>

2694
01:58:42.671 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>get through shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2695
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And so what changed it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing it over and over again.</v>

2696
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The martial arts is the first thing that</v>

2697
01:58:50.681 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I ever did where I was good at it or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel like a loser.</v>

2698
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It was like I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good at art and uh,</v>

2699
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.120
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be a comic book illustrator</v>

2701
01:59:03.221 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and that was like a big focus in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger.</v>

2702
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.450
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2703
01:59:07.451 --> 01:59:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I and I definitely took some sort of</v>

2704
01:59:09.821 --> 01:59:13.090
<v Speaker 1>identity in the fact that I was good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I liked the fact that people</v>

2705
01:59:13.091 --> 01:59:15.430
<v Speaker 1>would say I was good at it and made me</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel good.</v>

2706
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>But it was different than martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>because with martial arts,</v>

2707
01:59:20.170 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the first thing that I did where</v>

2708
01:59:23.051 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I could really be</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional I think could be really</v>

2709
01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:30.130
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in an are realize that,</v>

2710
01:59:30.690 --> 01:59:34.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all I was gifted physically and</v>

2711
01:59:34.751 --> 01:59:39.700
<v Speaker 1>then also this crazy brain of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could point it to something,</v>

2712
01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:42.700
<v Speaker 1>like I would work out at three o'clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning cause I knew nobody else</v>

2713
01:59:42.701 --> 01:59:44.440
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they weren't there.</v>

2714
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So I had keys to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a,</v>

2715
01:59:47.411 --> 01:59:49.750
<v Speaker 1>because I was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would go there,</v>

2716
01:59:49.751 --> 01:59:54.751
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up and I would drive down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym and I open it up in the middle</v>

2717
01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 1>of the night and put in a workout</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew that no one else was</v>

2718
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:01.210
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they weren't there and I knew,</v>

2719
02:00:01.211 --> 02:00:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it gave me an this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

2720
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>an edge.</v>

2721
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like there was,</v>

2722
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I was getting ahead of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:09.791
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was,</v>

2724
02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:14.791
<v Speaker 1>it was some sort of a crazy race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for between the age of 15 and 21 I</v>

2725
02:00:16.451 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>was just completely obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and that's all I did.</v>

2726
02:00:20.410 --> 02:00:21.243
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2727
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably barely knew who was</v>

2728
02:00:24.191 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know a goddamn thing about the</v>

2729
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't reading shit unless it was like</v>

2730
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>some Samurai book on philosophy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

2731
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Like that was all I was obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I was also a got an a</v>

2732
02:00:37.541 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>and they were ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthony robins and somewhere around that</v>

2733
02:00:39.461 --> 02:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was interested in like things that</v>

2734
02:00:42.431 --> 02:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>would give me an edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal development stuff that would</v>

2735
02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>give me an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then through doing martial arts and</v>

2736
02:00:47.951 --> 02:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>then also through teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a big one,</v>

2737
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>was teaching classes.</v>

2738
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>And then teaching at Bu was big too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause when I was teaching at Boston</v>

2739
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching an actual class</v>

2740
02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

2741
02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>at that time I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd won the u open,</v>

2742
02:01:04.491 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I had won a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>tournaments and I was,</v>

2743
02:01:07.770 --> 02:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2744
02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I was doing really well as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fighter,</v>

2745
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>as a martial arts competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2746
02:01:13.301 --> 02:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

2747
02:01:14.161 --> 02:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a taekwondo program at Bu and I was</v>

2748
02:01:15.971 --> 02:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>teaching it and I would have to address</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole class,</v>

2749
02:01:19.721 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but I would address a whole class as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was really good at,</v>

2750
02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>like I knew I could demonstrate them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2751
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>some movements and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows some things.</v>

2752
02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd asked someone to hold something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd kick it or something like that and</v>

2753
02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2754
02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And then they would listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could get,</v>

2755
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was confident in what I was saying</v>

2756
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>there and it was like the only time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life that I can remember being</v>

2757
02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>confident and telling people something.</v>

2758
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I would describe how you do</v>

2759
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how you do it and I'll show you</v>

2760
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>how to do it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is how it needs to be done and</v>

2761
02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens when you do it</v>

2762
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and this is what involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of your body and,</v>

2763
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave me the first,</v>

2764
02:01:58.191 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>that was like the first feeling that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got were,</v>

2765
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

2766
02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there was like a light at</v>

2767
02:02:03.141 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>the end of the tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I knew,</v>

2768
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:07.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least this now I don't feel like a</v>

2769
02:02:07.131 --> 02:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>loser anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2770
02:02:08.710 --> 02:02:10.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2771
02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.670
<v Speaker 4>It gave you something to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2772
02:02:12.671 --> 02:02:16.240
<v Speaker 4>be exceptional at yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what gives us</v>

2773
02:02:16.241 --> 02:02:20.560
<v Speaker 4>confidence is feeling like we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat mastered something like</v>

2774
02:02:20.561 --> 02:02:24.850
<v Speaker 4>somewhat really could understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>something well enough to teach it.</v>

2775
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2776
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just chasing it.</v>

2777
02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:32.680
<v Speaker 4>I think for and trying to get it through</v>
<v Speaker 4>little things we do.</v>

2778
02:02:32.681 --> 02:02:35.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's why a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go from career to career,</v>

2779
02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:37.240
<v Speaker 4>job to job or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to find that little bit of</v>

2780
02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:40.600
<v Speaker 4>instead of sticking with something and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really focusing in on really</v>

2781
02:02:40.601 --> 02:02:42.400
<v Speaker 4>studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I think the obsession</v>

2782
02:02:42.401 --> 02:02:44.320
<v Speaker 4>actually served you in a lot of ways.</v>

2783
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also expression than I,</v>

2784
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I love to use the martial arts are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle for developing your human</v>

2785
02:02:50.331 --> 02:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause it's so difficult and it's</v>

2786
02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of competing and yeah,</v>

2787
02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>in the physical consequences are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

2788
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>If you get hit that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

2789
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't have acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't slack off,</v>

2790
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really pursue this thing</v>

2791
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>with an insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2792
02:03:10.881 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>an incredible intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then through that you realize like,</v>

2793
02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.610
<v Speaker 1>oh I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2794
02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:17.090
<v Speaker 1>And then from doing that you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

2795
02:03:17.091 --> 02:03:22.091
<v Speaker 1>well what if I apply that to writing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book or doing that or learning how to do</v>

2796
02:03:22.641 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or for me it was standup comedy.</v>

2797
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That see,</v>

2798
02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:29.910
<v Speaker 4>stand up comedy seems terrifying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah.</v>

2799
02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

2800
02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying is working in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>office wearing tassels with shiny shoes.</v>

2801
02:03:35.650 --> 02:03:37.980
<v Speaker 4>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid socks.</v>

2802
02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was terrifying for me to,</v>

2803
02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember like Sunday nights I would</v>

2804
02:03:43.301 --> 02:03:45.850
<v Speaker 4>just get knots in my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>

2805
02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:50.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I have to go and be an awful staff</v>

2806
02:03:50.171 --> 02:03:52.740
<v Speaker 4>meetings on Monday mornings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

2807
02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.020
<v Speaker 4>sucking the oxygen out of your own life</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2808
02:03:57.570 --> 02:04:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why a lot of people start taking</v>

2809
02:04:00.671 --> 02:04:01.870
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2810
02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2811
02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:07.710
<v Speaker 1>That unhappiness of just what you call</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote real life.</v>

2812
02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.870
<v Speaker 1>There's been a structure that's put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that we've all sort of shuffled</v>

2813
02:04:12.871 --> 02:04:17.000
<v Speaker 1>into that doesn't serve us and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't serve most people.</v>

2814
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You'll have wim Hoff on last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2815
02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:22.200

<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

2816
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things he and I were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

2817
02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:25.410
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me his number about,</v>

2818
02:04:25.590 --> 02:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 7% of people or something like</v>

2819
02:04:28.021 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things that are creative with their,</v>

2820
02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What 7% 70% of the world.</v>

2821
02:04:33.511 --> 02:04:34.344
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2822
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get crazy and say it's 15% that's</v>

2823
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.390
<v Speaker 1>really small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2824
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

2825
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>100% of kids are creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2826
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Like my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both,</v>

2827
02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>they're both always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My young kids,</v>

2828
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>they're both always painting or drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing something in.</v>

2829
02:04:50.851 --> 02:04:55.851
<v Speaker 1>My older kid does music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is like so much creativity that</v>

2830
02:04:56.251 --> 02:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel drawn to it and all that stuff</v>

2831
02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>is something that every kid does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2832
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Every kid draws shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every kid plays with clay.</v>

2833
02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Every kid make stuff with legos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all like put things together,</v>

2834
02:05:09.781 --> 02:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>remind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line we're</v>

2835
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>stuffed into this structure that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve us.</v>

2836
02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And if we feel like we have to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've given,</v>

2837
02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>been shuffled through school and into</v>
<v Speaker 1>college and then we're in debt and then</v>

2838
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:27.690
<v Speaker 1>we have to take opportunities and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities is a good opportunity.</v>

2839
02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good,</v>

2840
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:30.000
<v Speaker 1>good career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2841
02:05:30.730 --> 02:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an end.</v>

2842
02:05:32.471 --> 02:05:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Like to go back to what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

2843
02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these systems that we've built are so</v>

2844
02:05:37.721 --> 02:05:42.721
<v Speaker 2>antiquated and so outdated from politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the school system and it all needs to</v>

2845
02:05:44.261 --> 02:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>change and we're seeing it start to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>or seen it start to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way we educate kids,</v>

2847
02:05:49.661 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>the way we relate to add and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2848
02:05:52.421 --> 02:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I think so much of Atdd is like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>current system and the way kids are like</v>

2849
02:05:56.950 --> 02:06:01.630
<v Speaker 2>can find in this classroom and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow these rules and sit still all</v>

2850
02:06:01.630 --> 02:06:02.640
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>

2851
02:06:02.890 --> 02:06:04.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no nurturing of creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2852
02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think over time a lot of this is</v>

2853
02:06:08.291 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 2>going to start to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so because we just can't squat.</v>

2854
02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:12.971
<v Speaker 2>I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2855
02:06:12.971 --> 02:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>with kids all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three nephews and I see the same</v>

2856
02:06:15.521 --> 02:06:15.820
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2857
02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:17.950
<v Speaker 2>They're so creative and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're confident.</v>

2858
02:06:17.951 --> 02:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>They don't care what other people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

2859
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:21.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a lot of fear.</v>

2860
02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:23.740
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they do do something creative,</v>

2861
02:06:23.741 --> 02:06:24.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't judge it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2862
02:06:24.881 --> 02:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just enjoy the process and</v>

2863
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:31.840
<v Speaker 2>that starts to phase out as we get older</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we get obsessed with other people</v>

2864
02:06:31.841 --> 02:06:34.090
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it good enough and is this safe and</v>

2865
02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.870
<v Speaker 2>well this please my parents and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>will I be able to make money this way</v>

2866
02:06:37.871 --> 02:06:42.460
<v Speaker 2>and we just get so disconnected from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that childlike creativity and</v>

2867
02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:46.330
<v Speaker 2>wonderment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity and and kind of no fear and</v>

2868
02:06:46.331 --> 02:06:50.560
<v Speaker 2>faith in ourselves that we just get</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in this kind of checklist,</v>

2869
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.420
<v Speaker 2>tassel wearing life.</v>

2870
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's another tassels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tassels,</v>

2871
02:06:55.001 --> 02:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>our enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's another thing that we</v>

2872
02:06:58.211 --> 02:07:00.520
<v Speaker 1>need to consider and this is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to people that are like,</v>

2873
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:02.290
<v Speaker 1>well this is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamer talk,</v>

2874
02:07:02.410 --> 02:07:06.670
<v Speaker 1>listen to this because this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That corporate worlds only been around</v>

2875
02:07:06.970 --> 02:07:11.970
<v Speaker 1>for less than a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing in modern life and</v>

2876
02:07:12.401 --> 02:07:15.850
<v Speaker 1>modern life is new in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>length of time.</v>

2877
02:07:15.851 --> 02:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Human beings have been alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing and it doesn't serve</v>

2878
02:07:20.081 --> 02:07:25.081
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe with technological innovation</v>

2879
02:07:25.511 --> 02:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and robots and automation and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit that's coming down the</v>

2880
02:07:28.751 --> 02:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there'll be less and less</v>

2881
02:07:30.581 --> 02:07:33.160
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for you to work a slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>job and you'll have to do something</v>

2882
02:07:33.161 --> 02:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be more and more compelling,</v>

2883
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but this world that we've structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't serve us is incredibly</v>

2884
02:07:41.261 --> 02:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>recent and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not rigid.</v>

2885
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2886
02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like you do,</v>

2887
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's actually really cool about</v>

2888
02:07:51.371 --> 02:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>

2889
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the generation that's now like 20 to 35</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 ish,</v>

2890
02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things I talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>generational diversity in millennials</v>

2891
02:08:00.971 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>and they're demanding a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of workplace.</v>

2892
02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>They're more likely to take a job where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have more creativity.</v>

2893
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>The culture is like less cubical base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have more freedom than a job with</v>

2894
02:08:13.271 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 2>like the salary and the benefits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not relating to work in the same</v>

2895
02:08:17.951 --> 02:08:19.420
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really questioning the old</v>

2896
02:08:19.421 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 2>paradigms there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't understand like why do I</v>

2897
02:08:22.571 --> 02:08:25.330
<v Speaker 2>have to be there from nine to five if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can like get this done at home,</v>

2898
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:27.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of time and a lot more</v>

2899
02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>of them are starting their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses and doing the more</v>

2900
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:33.490
<v Speaker 2>traditional path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're already starting to see</v>

2901
02:08:33.491 --> 02:08:37.000
<v Speaker 2>it change because we have a generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's huge.</v>

2902
02:08:37.001 --> 02:08:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean the millennial generation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ginormous and they're,</v>

2903
02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:41.980
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're demanding different things from</v>

2904
02:08:41.981 --> 02:08:43.870
<v Speaker 2>work and making different choices</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

2905
02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:45.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's already shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2906
02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>shifting.</v>

2907
02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think another thing that's</v>

2908
02:08:47.751 --> 02:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>bullshit is the amount of time that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to make a living just to</v>

2909
02:08:51.921 --> 02:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2910
02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.420
<v Speaker 1>how many people are barely being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feed themselves and housed themselves</v>

2911
02:08:58.790 --> 02:09:02.390
<v Speaker 1>and they're giving up their entire day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their entire week.</v>

2912
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:04.250
<v Speaker 1>And you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

2913
02:09:04.251 --> 02:09:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you get that Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday off,</v>

2914
02:09:06.351 --> 02:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time on Saturday and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday,</v>

2915
02:09:08.091 --> 02:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>if you have an an office job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some shit that you brought home</v>

2916
02:09:11.151 --> 02:09:12.590
<v Speaker 1>with you that you have to sort through.</v>

2917
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's the whole payment systems.</v>

2918
02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Crazy and you see like these instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities making all this money just</v>

2919
02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:27.320
<v Speaker 2>by posting pictures and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody going into a job like nine to</v>

2920
02:09:27.321 --> 02:09:29.690
<v Speaker 2>five day after day after day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely scraping by.</v>

2921
02:09:29.691 --> 02:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2922
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what freaks me out is people that just</v>

2923
02:09:33.711 --> 02:09:38.390
<v Speaker 1>move money around and they make billions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like think about like hedge fund people</v>

2924
02:09:38.391 --> 02:09:39.620
<v Speaker 1>and people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2925
02:09:39.621 --> 02:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>You're moving numbers around and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making numbers and the pro how much,</v>

2926
02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.330
<v Speaker 1>how much are you extracting while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving stuff around?</v>

2927
02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had this conversation with this</v>

2928
02:09:51.021 --> 02:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>woman who was like the staunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican who was telling me that the</v>

2929
02:09:53.931 --> 02:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so adamant that you can't raise</v>

2930
02:09:58.251 --> 02:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2931
02:09:59.571 --> 02:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2932
02:10:00.861 --> 02:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>was cause $15 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would crush businesses and we'll do</v>

2933
02:10:03.891 --> 02:10:04.581
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>

2934
02:10:04.581 --> 02:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2935
02:10:05.691 --> 02:10:08.210
<v Speaker 1>other people disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know whether or not that</v>

2936
02:10:08.211 --> 02:10:08.691
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2937
02:10:08.691 --> 02:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>do you want to work for less than 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks an hour?</v>

2938
02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:12.051
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2939
02:10:12.051 --> 02:10:13.970
<v Speaker 1>these are entry level jobs and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and none of them go,</v>

2940
02:10:13.971 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still requiring an hour of</v>

2941
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:19.780
<v Speaker 1>someone's time if your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>

2942
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>if you have a business and your business</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't pay someone $15 for an hour of</v>

2943
02:10:24.261 --> 02:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>their time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your business is bullshit.</v>

2944
02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you have too many employees or you,</v>

2945
02:10:30.441 --> 02:10:31.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2946
02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not set up right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're the person who's at the</v>

2947
02:10:35.421 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>lowest rung of the food chain to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hit,</v>

2948
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:41.030
<v Speaker 1>not the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a business,</v>

2949
02:10:41.031 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you came at pay someone $15 for a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour of working,</v>

2950
02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:47.090
<v Speaker 1>how much money are you generating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need all this business?</v>

2951
02:10:47.091 --> 02:10:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And why don't you know those employees</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it yourself?</v>

2952
02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not an efficient business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder what's going to happen with</v>

2953
02:10:53.061 --> 02:10:54.890
<v Speaker 1>automation and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2954
02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about like a tremendous</v>

2955
02:10:58.251 --> 02:11:02.000
<v Speaker 1>amount of jobs that are being done right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now by people that are going to be done</v>

2956
02:11:02.001 --> 02:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>by robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2957
02:11:03.591 --> 02:11:04.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time.</v>

2958
02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's even more important to nurture</v>

2959
02:11:07.741 --> 02:11:12.150
<v Speaker 4>your creativity and know what you can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>besides rely on the man or the</v>

2960
02:11:12.151 --> 02:11:15.540
<v Speaker 4>corporation or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think a lot of people think that</v>

2961
02:11:15.541 --> 02:11:19.800
<v Speaker 4>safety and economic security is in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in working for someone else course</v>

2962
02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.450
<v Speaker 4>and working for</v>

2963
02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:24.700
<v Speaker 1>bration getting a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing the ladder,</v>

2964
02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.170
<v Speaker 1>shooting your brains out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping off a building.</v>

2965
02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2966
02:11:31.330 --> 02:11:32.950
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that much time.</v>

2967
02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:34.360
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

2968
02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:37.360
<v Speaker 1>this is not a long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>

2969
02:11:37.361 --> 02:11:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It goes by really some 49 and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was 20 yesterday.</v>

2970
02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:41.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2971
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2972
02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be 59 and next thing you know I'll</v>

2973
02:11:46.541 --> 02:11:48.460
<v Speaker 1>be 69 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2974
02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll be able to close my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hear the yawning grave.</v>

2975
02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming for all of us.</v>

2976
02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have fun.</v>

2977
02:11:56.710 --> 02:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Gotta have fun while you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If in any way possible.</v>

2978
02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say that I think regret is far</v>

2979
02:12:03.071 --> 02:12:05.770
<v Speaker 4>worse than risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2980
02:12:06.070 --> 02:12:11.070
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather take risks in my life then</v>
<v Speaker 4>regret it safe or staying in situations</v>

2981
02:12:12.911 --> 02:12:16.510
<v Speaker 4>that I knew weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2982
02:12:16.570 --> 02:12:17.800
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>

2983
02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.720
<v Speaker 4>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2984
02:12:19.810 --> 02:12:23.320
<v Speaker 4>And there's no guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least you do it.</v>

2985
02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>That's where she comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2986
02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:25.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2987
02:12:26.290 --> 02:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>That's scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Ugh,</v>

2988
02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what forces you to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gets things done.</v>

2989
02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every two years I throw away my act and</v>

2990
02:12:33.911 --> 02:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I write a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a special,</v>

2991
02:12:35.891 --> 02:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like my netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I abandoned all those jokes and I have</v>

2992
02:12:38.681 --> 02:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>to write a whole new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2993
02:12:39.911 --> 02:12:43.210
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst.</v>

2994
02:12:43.690 --> 02:12:46.360
<v Speaker 1>But I keep doing it and every time I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2995
02:12:46.361 --> 02:12:49.120
<v Speaker 1>it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I keep doing it and I keep focusing</v>

2996
02:12:49.121 --> 02:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on.</v>

2997
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:52.270
<v Speaker 1>And all that terror and fear of taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chance,</v>

2998
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me get better at it.</v>

2999
02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pretty minor thing cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that much financial</v>

3000
02:12:58.631 --> 02:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>concern and I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for someone to take a chance</v>

3001
02:13:03.130 --> 02:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>financially and take a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their future and they don't really know</v>

3002
02:13:06.041 --> 02:13:08.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the future holds is not like they</v>

3003
02:13:08.141 --> 02:13:12.310
<v Speaker 1>have all these things to fall back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you fucking dig in.</v>

3004
02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>That's when you make things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3005
02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

3006
02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3007
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you just stay soft and lazy.</v>

3008
02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:13:20.681 --> 02:13:24.970
<v Speaker 4>Then and you never really discover your</v>
<v Speaker 4>true potential if you just stay</v>

3010
02:13:25.570 --> 02:13:26.403
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>

3011
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Christina's people out there right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are listening,</v>

3012
02:13:29.150 --> 02:13:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that are getting fired up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen this right now they're jogging in</v>

3013
02:13:31.411 --> 02:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>place and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

3014
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to listen to Christine.</v>

3015
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good,</v>

3016
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.911
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:13:38.911 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>

3018
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 4>But don't just like here's this broke</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lighter.</v>

3019
02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Can you really end it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't just like feel motivated.</v>

3020
02:13:46.921 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Like actually like commit to one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3021
02:13:51.331 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 4>what's one thing you can do to start</v>
<v Speaker 4>shifting your life?</v>

3022
02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:56.730
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

3023
02:13:56.731 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 4>finding that hobby?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it like having a conversation with</v>

3024
02:13:59.251 --> 02:14:01.020
<v Speaker 4>your boss?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it going after that creative</v>

3025
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:02.820
<v Speaker 4>endeavor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just start,</v>

3026
02:14:02.821 --> 02:14:06.690
<v Speaker 4>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people think they have to know all</v>

3027
02:14:06.691 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 4>the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I want to get to the second</v>

3028
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:11.520
<v Speaker 4>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the bottom of a staircase and</v>

3029
02:14:11.521 --> 02:14:13.680
<v Speaker 4>like I think I just have to jump to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3030
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:15.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you go step by step by step,</v>

3031
02:14:15.691 --> 02:14:19.590
<v Speaker 4>just like you'd walk up the staircase so</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to know it all at once.</v>

3032
02:14:19.591 --> 02:14:22.080
<v Speaker 4>It's just taking that first step and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that leads to another and that</v>

3033
02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:22.560
<v Speaker 4>leads to another.</v>

3034
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.690
<v Speaker 4>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's the scary moments where you</v>

3035
02:14:24.691 --> 02:14:28.020
<v Speaker 4>find your grit and you find your</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential and you find out how you</v>

3036
02:14:28.021 --> 02:14:32.040
<v Speaker 4>respond to adversity and you find your</v>
<v Speaker 4>true gifts and you can only do that in</v>

3037
02:14:32.041 --> 02:14:33.510
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're uncomfortable,</v>

3038
02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:36.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe she'd be a clarity adviser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The clarity advisor,</v>

3039
02:14:36.991 --> 02:14:38.380
<v Speaker 4>like some kind of psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3040
02:14:38.381 --> 02:14:38.641
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3041
02:14:38.641 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarity.</v>

3042
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psyche wouldn't be a Clara.</v>

3043
02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I knew charm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my new.</v>

3044
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.911
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha,</v>

3045
02:14:44.911 --> 02:14:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cleared the advisor.</v>

3046
02:14:46.891 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>

3047
02:14:48.450 --> 02:14:49.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a little wordy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3048
02:14:49.921 --> 02:14:51.180
<v Speaker 4>it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3049
02:14:51.181 --> 02:14:53.930
<v Speaker 4>we're getting closer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a step dad.</v>

3050
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>There's something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bright like you're,</v>

3051
02:14:57.090 --> 02:14:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I tell people that I</v>

3052
02:14:58.591 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 1>think is really important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's helped me a lot is write the things</v>

3053
02:15:02.401 --> 02:15:05.490
<v Speaker 1>down that you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a list.</v>

3054
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as your day,</v>

3055
02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:12.120
<v Speaker 1>like the best way to get shit done is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stare that Goddamn list and say,</v>

3056
02:15:12.121 --> 02:15:13.680
<v Speaker 1>all right today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I work out?</v>

3057
02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Did I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I do this?</v>

3058
02:15:15.271 --> 02:15:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would take care of that stuff.</v>

3059
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff that you need to do,</v>

3060
02:15:18.841 --> 02:15:21.900
<v Speaker 1>do it at the beginning of the day or</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it when you go to bed at night,</v>

3061
02:15:21.901 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even better before you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed at night.</v>

3062
02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Set your intention for the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

3063
02:15:26.321 --> 02:15:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get all this shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3064
02:15:27.931 --> 02:15:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll give yourself 1520 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have it.</v>

3065
02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got 15 minutes.</v>

3066
02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And then write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it,</v>

3068
02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:38.400
<v Speaker 1>put it on a piece of paper and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day check that shit off.</v>

3069
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do those things.</v>

3070
02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you could just get in the habit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing that.</v>

3071
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to avoid cause people love</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just be lazy.</v>

3072
02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>These they love the distraction of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing</v>

3073
02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:49.470
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have time.</v>

3074
02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And saying they don't have time but,</v>

3075
02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but that is one that has been incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to me is writing things down,</v>

3076
02:15:56.470 --> 02:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>making a list and forcing myself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>check all the shit off that's on that</v>

3077
02:16:00.491 --> 02:16:00.820
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>

3078
02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And doing the things you don't always</v>

3079
02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:05.200
<v Speaker 4>feel like doing and and also being</v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable that people like having</v>

3080
02:16:05.201 --> 02:16:07.000
<v Speaker 4>somebody that's like calling you and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3081
02:16:07.001 --> 02:16:08.740
<v Speaker 4>did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did you do it?</v>

3082
02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Did you show up for yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it takes momentum,</v>

3083
02:16:11.650 --> 02:16:13.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like making these kinds of changes.</v>

3084
02:16:13.811 --> 02:16:17.140
<v Speaker 4>You have to build momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you have that checklist and</v>

3085
02:16:17.141 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 4>you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one thing every day and maybe the</v>

3086
02:16:19.991 --> 02:16:22.720
<v Speaker 4>first thing you're going to do is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>commit to making a list every day.</v>

3087
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:26.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a great step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you start showing up for yourself</v>

3088
02:16:26.230 --> 02:16:28.750
<v Speaker 4>every day and doing that and checking</v>
<v Speaker 4>things off the list,</v>

3089
02:16:28.751 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 4>you start build self trust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start to have more integrity with</v>

3090
02:16:30.941 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start to build momentum and then</v>

3091
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:35.770
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to take the next step and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the next thing.</v>

3092
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.770
<v Speaker 4>But without that momentum and without</v>
<v Speaker 4>that commitment,</v>

3093
02:16:38.771 --> 02:16:42.790
<v Speaker 4>I think people just expect their life to</v>
<v Speaker 4>change like this and it,</v>

3094
02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.370
<v Speaker 4>like we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about this a lot.</v>

3095
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Like it just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those little stops,</v>

3096
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 4>they start to make you feel better too</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you start to feel like,</v>

3097
02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:55.150
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing the same thing over and</v>

3098
02:16:55.151 --> 02:16:57.790
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause that really is insanity.</v>

3099
02:16:58.130 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 4>One an Einstein who said insanity is</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the same thing over and over again</v>

3100
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:04.460
<v Speaker 4>expecting a different result.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like that.</v>

3101
02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:05.980
<v Speaker 4>That to me is crazy making</v>

3102
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:08.890
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's a thing that people</v>

3103
02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:14.100
<v Speaker 1>have to be aware of and that is the trap</v>
<v Speaker 1>of falling back into old patterns</v>

3104
02:17:14.111 --> 02:17:16.900
<v Speaker 1>because they offer you comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens to a lot of people that</v>

3105
02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:19.300
<v Speaker 1>want to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losing weight is a big one.</v>

3106
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:21.130
<v Speaker 1>They start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start off good,</v>

3107
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>they start losing weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start looking great and then</v>

3108
02:17:24.491 --> 02:17:28.240
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old pattern calls to them,</v>

3109
02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>this is us as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck</v>

3110
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:30.780
<v Speaker 4>donut man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've won,</v>

3111
02:17:30.781 --> 02:17:34.240
<v Speaker 4>or you've earned a donut krispy kreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just get a couple of them with some big</v>

3112
02:17:34.241 --> 02:17:37.120
<v Speaker 4>deal tomorrow you get back on the track</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just never do.</v>

3113
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:38.880
<v Speaker 4>You never get back on track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3114
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3115
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a really common for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's cigarette smoking or you</v>

3116
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:43.991
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank,</v>

3117
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Old Patterns are really hard.</v>

3118
02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:52.480
<v Speaker 4>They're really hard to avoid because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they offer some sort of bizarre comfort.</v>

3119
02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like coping strategies and so</v>

3120
02:17:54.941 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 4>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3121
02:17:55.841 --> 02:18:00.841
<v Speaker 4>so many people eat or smoke or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>for comfort or to self soothe themselves</v>

3122
02:18:01.570 --> 02:18:03.080
<v Speaker 4>and so they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3123
02:18:03.081 --> 02:18:06.520
<v Speaker 4>make a new year's resolution and lose</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weight and then if they haven't</v>

3124
02:18:06.521 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 4>found another way to cope with life when</v>
<v Speaker 4>things get hard or</v>

3125
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 4>someone upsets them or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to turn to that old</v>

3126
02:18:16.061 --> 02:18:21.040
<v Speaker 4>coping device because they haven't dealt</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the issue underneath what made them</v>

3127
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:23.230
<v Speaker 4>over ate or drank or smoke in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

3128
02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:24.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3129
02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:28.840
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're filled with anger and does</v>

3130
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:30.700
<v Speaker 1>all these things are fucked up in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3131
02:18:30.701 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>There's something about those old</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that like give you a big hug.</v>

3132
02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3133
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:37.840

3134
02:18:37.841 --> 02:18:39.280

<v Speaker 4>but it's really disgusting.</v>

3135
02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Covered with bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to look at it.</v>

3136
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.440
<v Speaker 1>If people want to get ahold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they do that?</v>

3137
02:18:47.441 --> 02:18:48.274
<v Speaker 1>How do they go about it?</v>

3138
