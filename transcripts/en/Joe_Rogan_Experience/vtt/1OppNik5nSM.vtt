<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

14
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

15
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I never planned on it and I don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like that.</v>

16
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That what's a good name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't come up with a better name for</v>

17
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:43.414
<v Speaker 1>it and let's come up with</v>

18
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe by the end of the show will come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with something better so that that's.</v>

19
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 2>That's your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Got my new title by the end of the</v>

20
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started out in Hollywood.</v>

21
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved out after college to La because</v>

22
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 2>mainly because growing up I was teased a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

23
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I was massively insecure and if you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got something to prove,</v>

24
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood's a great place to come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here to like,</v>

25
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking show you.</v>

26
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 2>They'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I since I didn't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a lot of friends and boys</v>

28
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 2>didn't really ever like me unless they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to cheat off my paper.</v>

29
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I became addicted to achieving and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

30
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 2>what can I be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be somebody like if only I was</v>

31
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old was I?</v>

32
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it started,</v>

33
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:24.894
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

34
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

35
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That's when you started like wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove yourself.</v>

36
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Not</v>

37
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Teasing started happening and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started to feel like I didn't</v>

38
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 2>really fit in and I needed to find a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel worth something.</v>

39
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>So overachieving kind of became my way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

40
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And then at 10 I was diagnosed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and put on Prozac at 10.</v>

41
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 2>I know that's what we'll bookmark that</v>
<v Speaker 2>combined.</v>

42
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 2>And so from a very early age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really thought something was wrong</v>

43
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fit in and so I had to come up</v>

44
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 2>with these compensatory strategies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel worthy,</v>

45
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 2>to feel validated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I mattered and so I just</v>

46
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 2>became like straight a student addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to achieving,</v>

47
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>went out to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Texas,</v>

48
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 2>went to northwestern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduated early and was just committed</v>

49
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 2>to moving to Hollywood and working my</v>
<v Speaker 2>way up as an actor.</v>

50
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:16.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kid,</v>

51
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I was an actor.</v>

52
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I tried that for a little bit and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

53
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is way too much rejection.</v>

54
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go on the other side of the</v>

55
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 2>camera and pursue this career in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood and I didn't know what exactly</v>

56
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going to be a producer</v>

57
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I came out.</v>

58
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:35.211
<v Speaker 2>I was 20 years old and I applied to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>William Morris Agency to be an</v>

59
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.421
<v Speaker 2>assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

60
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through the training</v>
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>

61
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>which is like pushing mail carts around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did not want to do that.</v>

62
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:45.441
<v Speaker 2>So somehow I got a desk like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>early and started working for the head</v>

63
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>of TV packaging and quickly learned I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not want to be an agent,</v>

64
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>just didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy long hours.</v>

65
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I was treated poorly.</v>

66
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>It was just a hellish job and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of selling and I didn't really like</v>

67
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I left and actually went and worked</v>

68
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>

69
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought maybe I'll like production.</v>

70
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>So first season as the man show I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

71
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.770
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of a blast and also just</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy crazy show to work on.</v>

72
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jimmy and Adam were always like</v>
<v Speaker 2>super awesome to me,</v>

73
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>but I was a young girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pa running around the jug dancers were</v>

74
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.130
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

75
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing here?</v>

76
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>So I quickly got out of production and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then started in comedy development at</v>

77
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 2>paramount and started scouting comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to comedy clubs and finding</v>

78
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 2>people that I could represent and bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

79
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe get deals for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that quickly transitioned to moving</v>

80
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 2>to another company where I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy development and then I quickly</v>

81
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 2>fell back into being an agent.</v>

82
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>So that was like my first career was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going to comedy clubs late at</v>

83
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at f two,</v>

84
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.531
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 2>with the first client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was your first client.</v>

86
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Eddie very well was my very first</v>

87
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still keep in touch.</v>

88
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>He says hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like my life.</v>

89
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>So here I am now 24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25,</v>

90
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 2>working at a big agency representing</v>
<v Speaker 2>clients.</v>

91
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I was the youngest female agent like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the department,</v>

92
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe even in the city at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

93
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 2>it was really young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got promoted really,</v>

94
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>really super young and I was dating the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head of a movie studio and I was living</v>

95
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>this amazing Hollywood life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like making a lot of money going to the</v>

96
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Oscars and Golden Globes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private jets.</v>

97
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Hanging out with celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I totally had it all,</v>

98
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but I still wasn't happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I had achieved one thing and</v>

99
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 2>then there had to be the next thing.</v>

100
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And then I did achieve this and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be next thing you knew I'd get</v>

101
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still wouldn't be happy.</v>

102
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I get the promotion still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on that constant chase and nothing</v>

103
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.731
<v Speaker 2>ever was like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about two years I did this job,</v>

104
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm still on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also taking antianxiety pills at the</v>

105
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>time and just like trying to like manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

106
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.240
<v Speaker 2>And I was one of those people that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could really look good from the outside.</v>

107
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I could seem like I had it all together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the inside was a totally different</v>

108
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like a duck on water,</v>

109
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks smooth.</v>

110
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>But underneath it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

111
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 2>that was what I was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

112
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people ask me about how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve all this and still like suffer</v>

113
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>from depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was a very functional depressed</v>

114
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

115
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people think if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed you just lay in bed all day</v>

116
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>and watch soap operas or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the,</v>

117
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>summarize all depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's different ways it shows up.</v>

119
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.910
<v Speaker 2>And so I was able to live my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always felt like something was</v>

120
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like I wasn't enough and I</v>

121
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>just had this heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy energy and,</v>

122
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing I could achieve whatever,</v>

123
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>filling that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me keep going.</v>

124
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

125
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 2>one day I was riding up in the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and I had basically a mini panic</v>

126
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't breathe.</v>

127
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I got off the elevator and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't catch my breath and was looking</v>

128
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot weird foot painting and</v>

129
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>art in our office and I was looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird photos and the one outside of</v>

130
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 2>my desk was this woman in a negligee who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is nine months pregnant in this huge</v>

131
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>yard sale with a Ufo light shining down</v>
<v Speaker 2>on her about to take her up.</v>

132
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at this painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's me.</v>

133
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>How did I get here?</v>

134
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

135
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I walked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back down the elevator,</v>

136
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 2>walked around Beverly Hills and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back upstairs and I just wanted to</v>

137
00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.240
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I wanted to do was quit.</v>

138
00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the answer was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

139
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I quit my job and reinvent myself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>start over,</v>

140
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.350
<v Speaker 2>but I needed someone to give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission and so I called my dad</v>

141
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>because my dad is has always been there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me and I'm like,</v>

142
00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want to quit this job.</v>

143
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Can I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He did a really good dad thing.</v>

144
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Really pissed me off at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a good dad move.</v>

145
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.823
<v Speaker 2>You want to guess what he did,</v>

146
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>so you get your shit together,</v>

147
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.150
<v Speaker 2>said I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't make this decision for you.</v>

148
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.430
<v Speaker 2>That is a good dad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get that thing.</v>

149
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 2>And he hung up and I quit the next day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the first really big risk I</v>

150
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>ever took.</v>

151
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Why did you feel like you were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant woman with a Ufo about to take</v>

152
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you off in a flying saucer?</v>

153
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Felt confused and lost and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fit in and like chaos and it's</v>

154
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 2>all wrong and how did I get here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has happened?</v>

155
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that Hollywood has so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many stories?</v>

156
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not obviously,</v>

157
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>not exactly like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many stories of people who were</v>

158
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>rejected and who have decided they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come here to prove something or</v>

159
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to get the love that they need and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they run into.</v>

160
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They're in the business of rejection for</v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

161
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't really think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people don't act,</v>

162
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>but if you try to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to audition.</v>

163
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>If you audition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to audition with hundreds</v>

164
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all trying to get the same job</v>

165
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>and they treat you like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people were trying to get the same</v>

166
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest thing and people leave</v>

167
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're just devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so confused.</v>

168
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 1>They get nervous before the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they leave the thing and they feel</v>

169
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>so helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

170
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange,</v>

171
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>strange business</v>

172
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 2>really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

173
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so often not based on talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

174
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so often not based on who's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best person for the job and that's what</v>

175
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:17.440
<v Speaker 2>frustrated me as an agent and also one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons I left.</v>

176
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I had a deal that I put together Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was actually involved in it and my</v>

177
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 2>boss made me attach a show runner who</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody wanted and but he needed the</v>

178
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>police of that client and it killed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shout and it killed these guys that</v>

179
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 2>opportunity</v>

180
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.770
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

181
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but happened to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I took over the man show,</v>

182
00:08:33.751 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a show runner that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

183
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>this weird incestuous sort of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in Hollywood of connecting</v>

184
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost more about being social than</v>

185
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.820
<v Speaker 1>it is about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about making these relationships</v>

186
00:08:47.821 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 1>almost like politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become beholden to these people and</v>

187
00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you get them jobs and they get you jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you all just feed off of each and</v>

188
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>y'all suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really happens a lot.</v>

189
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.030
<v Speaker 1>It happens a lot with comedy writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

190
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of comedy writers that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

191
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:04.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

192
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.870
<v Speaker 1>They might have even been on Seinfeld or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a great show and there's</v>

193
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>a few brilliant writers and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few that are like,</v>

194
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this guy doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

195
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.850
<v Speaker 1>his agent is this guy's agent and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

196
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>agent force this guy in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get that guy,</v>

197
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you get this guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they make these deals.</v>

198
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what was so frustrating for</v>

199
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:24.680
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'd have these really talented people</v>

200
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get them jobs.</v>

201
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Why did they put you on Prozac at 10?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

202
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>were you an only child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

203
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:30.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

204
00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I was the oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest.</v>

205
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>How many kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to.</v>

206
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.060
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents loved me a lot and they just</v>

208
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.450
<v Speaker 2>were doing the best they could and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were listening to doctors,</v>

209
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a time when,</v>

210
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 2>if a doctor tells you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you listen,</v>

211
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>what was bombing you out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

212
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.840
<v Speaker 1>like what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it the point where they were</v>

213
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>willing to put you on medication?</v>

214
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I went from when I was little,</v>

215
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:56.821
<v Speaker 2>I was really outgoing and talkative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

216
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And then when the teasing and bullying</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to happen,</v>

217
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I completely just shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I shut off particular group of</v>

218
00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>people that did it to one girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

219
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>she's the one I wanted to mention when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>won my Oscar that was,</v>

220
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.250
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get up there and say get up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and then eventually,</v>

221
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.220
<v Speaker 2>eventually I got over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

222
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really just shut down and withdrew and</v>

223
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you move to a different school or</v>

224
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Speaker 1>was it just one particular kid?</v>

225
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.100
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were like,</v>

226
00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 2>go to a different school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>

227
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wouldn't.</v>

228
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stubborn and I wanted to stay and</v>

229
00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I was just scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

230
00:10:33.191 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oftentimes what we know that's,</v>

231
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.380
<v Speaker 2>that's bad is safer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel safer than what we don't know that</v>

232
00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 2>might be better at my had a comfort zone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where I was like,</v>

233
00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:47.080
<v Speaker 2>even though I wasn't really happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I knew that school,</v>

234
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was afraid that if I went to new</v>

235
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 2>school I would just have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

236
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stay where I am.</v>

237
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that you could run into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong person when you're 10 years</v>

238
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could fuck you up for a decade or</v>

239
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

240
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.530
<v Speaker 2>But I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

242
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any human who hasn't had</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in childhood or adulthood or</v>

243
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can call bad jamie.</v>

244
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 2>We're them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

245
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever gone wrong with you.</v>

246
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Just wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming from</v>

247
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>smooth and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young James collected.</v>

248
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

249
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody's had difficulties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unavoidable.</v>

250
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullying thing is very.</v>

251
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange how prevalent it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it seems to be a part of human</v>

252
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:35.211
<v Speaker 1>nature that people have some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to find someone who's weak or</v>

253
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 1>who's insecure or who is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then literally go after them and put</v>

254
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 1>yourself in front of them and fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and ruin their life.</v>

255
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go get her.</v>

256
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird natural pattern that human</v>

257
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>beings follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always wondered like,</v>

258
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk to God sad about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the evolutionary basis for</v>

259
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it about people that makes</v>

260
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>them want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially young people.</v>

261
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

262
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's different with the</v>

263
00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 2>white girls do it in the way boys do</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls do it.</v>

264
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.440
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more sneaky and I think a</v>

265
00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:12.800
<v Speaker 2>lot of times it's based more on jealousy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that might have like,</v>

266
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might have some girl unattractive.</v>

267
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>

268
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smart.</v>

269
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.410
<v Speaker 2>School came easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The teachers really liked me,</v>

270
00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:25.190
<v Speaker 2>parents liked me and so I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might have had something to do with</v>

271
00:12:25.191 --> 00:12:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it and again I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.150
<v Speaker 2>is 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have no idea why they did what</v>

273
00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:31.730
<v Speaker 2>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was more sneaky like passing</v>

274
00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:35.570
<v Speaker 2>around notes saying I joined the I hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christine club and like having everyone</v>

275
00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:40.571
<v Speaker 2>sign it and just kind of quietly doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it behind my back and pulling all my</v>

276
00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:44.030
<v Speaker 2>friends way where I think boys are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>more aggressive.</v>

277
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll beat you up,</v>

278
00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>they'll put you in lockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that,</v>

279
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's just a,</v>

280
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.230
<v Speaker 2>a power thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within every bully as a scared little</v>

281
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:56.210
<v Speaker 2>boy or little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

282
00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I think how we were always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>

283
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:01.370
<v Speaker 2>but so much of the time we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>compensate for something,</v>

284
00:13:01.371 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or refill less than where we feel</v>

285
00:13:03.201 --> 00:13:05.660
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think if we can just have power over</v>

286
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:08.180
<v Speaker 2>something or somebody else that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make us feel better.</v>

287
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 1>There's also a thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the I hate Christine Club thing</v>

288
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>where the other girls would probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

289
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be on the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to join in.</v>

290
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You get scared that they're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you next and you want to be on the</v>

291
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>main team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's going on with</v>

292
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

293
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are with him and for him he's,</v>

294
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>he's so vindictive and mean and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes after people,</v>

295
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you see a lot of people support</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and sort of like,</v>

296
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>like cower to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even that Megan Kelly chick who's a</v>

297
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 1>super brassy Badass ice princess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did that interview with him after</v>

298
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they had their little thing when she sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with them and she was.</v>

299
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 1>She was so like submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

300
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe we should try to keep her</v>

301
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Fox News where the riot act,</v>

302
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really bizarre to watch her</v>

303
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:02.190
<v Speaker 1>tone down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see?</v>

304
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.660
<v Speaker 2>See the followup interviews?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

305
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 2>She didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't call him out on anything.</v>

306
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just.</v>

307
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was really submissive.</v>

308
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not what I expected it was.</v>

309
00:14:11.221 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 1>It was very orchestrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it was kind of obvious at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

311
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the nominee or he was on his way.</v>

312
00:14:18.331 --> 00:14:23.010
<v Speaker 1>It looked like all the other nominees</v>
<v Speaker 1>were falling apart and she did this</v>

313
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.660
<v Speaker 1>interview with her and him sat in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>office room,</v>

314
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:30.900
<v Speaker 1>like sat across from a table and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people are scared.</v>

315
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.490
<v Speaker 1>People are scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the the strong man or strong woman,</v>

316
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:35.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

317
00:14:35.781 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who's going to go after you</v>

318
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.010
<v Speaker 2>or the unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think Donald is so unpredictable.</v>

319
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:43.170
<v Speaker 2>You never know what he's going to throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you and he,</v>

320
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.020
<v Speaker 2>he will go to whatever lengths he needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to,</v>

321
00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:49.440
<v Speaker 2>to humiliate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make you feel less than two to throw</v>

322
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you off your game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

323
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 2>So she probably was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better just,</v>

324
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.350
<v Speaker 1>well he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sues so many people and so many</v>

325
00:14:56.351 --> 00:14:57.910
<v Speaker 1>people sue him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

326
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>that's his world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a normal thing for him.</v>

328
00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:04.390
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't have a bunch of lawsuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around the world probably feels</v>

329
00:15:04.391 --> 00:15:07.510
<v Speaker 1>like nothing is even happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to gotta get something going.</v>

330
00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I got sue somebody crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that,</v>

331
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.890
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are attracted to him because they</v>

332
00:15:14.891 --> 00:15:17.550
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be on his bad side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people were terrified of them.</v>

333
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super billionaire,</v>

334
00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:19.690
<v Speaker 1>very famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

335
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.780
<v Speaker 1>powerful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of people that,</v>

336
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.000
<v Speaker 1>like with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate Christine Club.</v>

337
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 1>If there was this one mean bitch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanted to go after you,</v>

338
00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to side with her just because</v>

339
00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:39.340
<v Speaker 1>they're scared that she's going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and start going after them next.</v>

340
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

341
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.980
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

342
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>it's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

343
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a tribal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes this weird,</v>

344
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:47.230
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our leader now.</v>

345
00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:48.064
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

346
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.610
<v Speaker 1>a lot of leaders are the most vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

347
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:53.350
<v Speaker 1>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying people,</v>

348
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the dictators in Russia or Putin</v>

349
00:15:56.351 --> 00:15:58.750
<v Speaker 1>or Kim Jong Una and what are they known</v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

350
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.170
<v Speaker 1>The dictators and a lot of these Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern countries,</v>

351
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.520
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless people and everyone's scared of</v>

352
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole goal behind them,</v>

353
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

354
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better to be behind them,</v>

355
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 2>go up against them to feel the RAF.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

356
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fear is a big motivator</v>

357
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

358
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.870
<v Speaker 2>and it I think impacts our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really think clearly about something</v>

359
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.820
<v Speaker 2>because we're just so scared and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened that we,</v>

360
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.560
<v Speaker 2>we stopped questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

361
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what is he really saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When is he really leading me to?</v>

362
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the thing with Donald and</v>

363
00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I talk to people who support him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

364
00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:35.050
<v Speaker 2>but do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you understand?</v>

365
00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Like he would have more money if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were to just like taken the money.</v>

366
00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 2>His father left him and invested it</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus all the bankrupting he's done in</v>

367
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 2>the keys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just so much that doesn't make</v>

368
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:47.620
<v Speaker 2>sense about him yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

369
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:48.454
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

370
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.050
<v Speaker 1>it's never been a man alive that needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms more than Donald Trump is.</v>

371
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:54.550
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard of them.</v>

372
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

373
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there probably has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he needs him back.</v>

374
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He needs to go straight to the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you might need to go right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he needs something.</v>

376
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

377
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he's almost like this super impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>huberous character.</v>

378
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

379
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 1>everything is like when Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

380
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:14.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't pay taxes because.</v>

381
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he can't help,</v>

382
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:18.970
<v Speaker 1>like you're on the deer at a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate on TV.</v>

383
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.460
<v Speaker 1>You said you're smart because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay taxes.</v>

384
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

385
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Really reflects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not just him like it really</v>

386
00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:29.731
<v Speaker 2>reflects like where we are as a society</v>
<v Speaker 2>that enough people support him to get</v>

387
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.990
<v Speaker 2>him to the place that he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're so polarized right now and</v>

388
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:35.351
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

389
00:17:35.351 --> 00:17:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't really love either candidate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be honest.</v>

390
00:17:37.331 --> 00:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that.</v>

391
00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I hope that maybe this is just wishful</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that will have four years of</v>

392
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:47.110
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be hillary and then in</v>

393
00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>the next election we'll have people run</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're actually excited about</v>

394
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 2>supporting and voting for</v>

395
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see those people anywhere.</v>

396
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.810
<v Speaker 1>The job one wants the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

397
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy job and it's a job where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to destroy you if you run for</v>

398
00:18:03.401 --> 00:18:04.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:07.060
<v Speaker 1>and you're seeing that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with trump and you're seeing that with</v>

400
00:18:07.061 --> 00:18:11.320
<v Speaker 1>hillary and they're pulling out all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops and by the time it's over,</v>

401
00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of the commander in chief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be terrible no matter who</v>

402
00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:16.804
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

403
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that Crooked Hillary thing is</v>

404
00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.390
<v Speaker 1>going to stick forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Crooked Hillary.</v>

405
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna stick forever and People's</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion of him is horrible.</v>

406
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no matter who wins and she's going</v>

407
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:29.410
<v Speaker 1>to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>

408
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for any of us.</v>

409
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't represent what we think of</v>

410
00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the United States as we think of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States as being this unbelievable</v>

411
00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:44.230
<v Speaker 1>place of creativity and innovation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest superpower the world's ever</v>

412
00:18:44.231 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 1>known and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.350
<v Speaker 1>this really progressive force for good</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

414
00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:51.610
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

415
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we need to go through this time</v>

416
00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:58.730
<v Speaker 2>though to shake it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe things need to get bad to get</v>

417
00:18:58.731 --> 00:18:59.470
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

418
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I see that in human psychology so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you need to hit rock bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to go through these hard times</v>

420
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.600
<v Speaker 2>so you have something better emerge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's just wishful thinking.</v>

421
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably right.</v>

422
00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I think we also needed to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the wikileaks revelations,</v>

423
00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:18.940
<v Speaker 1>like how exactly politics is run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with the people we think that are</v>

424
00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:22.390
<v Speaker 1>the good folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's all fucking gross and dirty</v>

425
00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 1>and all the stuff with the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundation and all the stuff they did to</v>

426
00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Bernie sanders and they conspired to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that guy out and there's.</v>

427
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a Democrat too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a whole.</v>

428
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.340
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was supposed to be about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the person that best represents</v>

429
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:41.341
<v Speaker 1>the people with the people choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the Democratic National</v>

430
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Committee was fucking working to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that Bernie Sanders wasn't the guy</v>

431
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and they were all conspiring with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and they're all pulling favors.</v>

432
00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:53.110
<v Speaker 1>This just like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>before with producers and networks.</v>

433
00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just using your power and your</v>

434
00:19:56.201 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Speaker 1>influence and all the friends that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've made and all the years and all</v>

435
00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:03.820
<v Speaker 1>the favors and and pulling it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we're being exposed to it in a</v>

436
00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:06.760
<v Speaker 1>way that we haven't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Watergate,</v>

437
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Watergate gave us like a little window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny little window,</v>

438
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but the access to information was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>minuscule back then,</v>

439
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.120
<v Speaker 1>like we clung to those 15 minutes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

440
00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Watergate tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

441
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.740
<v Speaker 1>and we look at this.</v>

442
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a crook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing what they were all doing.</v>

443
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.030
<v Speaker 1>He just got caught and we got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a sense of it now,</v>

444
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 1>but now when you read these emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how they really feel about each</v>

445
00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:34.180
<v Speaker 1>other and all the fucking gross list</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes on.</v>

446
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to not engage too much in the</v>

447
00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 2>gross ness because it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>

448
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess the point is to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world really is about.</v>

449
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>What the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government that looms over us is</v>

450
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:53.530
<v Speaker 1>really all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are certain things legal?</v>

451
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Why certain things illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are certain loopholes in place?</v>

452
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 1>How did they get in place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from them?</v>

453
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 1>What is a charity and if it is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>charity,</v>

454
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>how come you get paid so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how come you get paid $250,000 to</v>

455
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 1>speak and then all this money goes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your charity,</v>

456
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but that $250,000 goes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just talked for an hour.</v>

457
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a scam,</v>

458
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing like you're asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being curious,</v>

459
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.020
<v Speaker 2>being curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're asking questions and I think</v>

460
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 2>that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what so many people are doing or</v>

461
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 2>just getting mad and just trash talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America and the candidates and and</v>

462
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't do any good for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to like ask questions and</v>

463
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 2>get involved and start to get curious</v>
<v Speaker 2>and quest,</v>

464
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.140
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

465
00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how we change things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think too much of this has just</v>

466
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 2>been so emotionally driven that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just getting upset and not really</v>

467
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 2>going home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I do?</v>

468
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 2>What can I learn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I shift this in some way?</v>

469
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also people are like super psyched</v>

470
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:53.010
<v Speaker 1>to get behind their candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third team.</v>

471
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross on both sides for sure.</v>

472
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of grossness on the trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

473
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of mean assholes that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally found another mean asshole</v>

474
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.170
<v Speaker 1>that's running for president and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped like he's one of them,</v>

475
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.440
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a lot of men who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>using Hashtag.</v>

476
00:22:10.441 --> 00:22:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her and they're the grossest</v>
<v Speaker 1>little fucking white knights.</v>

477
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've run across a few of them on</v>

478
00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a white knight.</v>

479
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what a white knight is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

480
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 1>You really don't know like a knight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>shining armor.</v>

481
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.080
<v Speaker 1>A man who comes along comes along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions himself as the superior</v>

482
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.330
<v Speaker 1>morally superior to call Michael Shermer</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls a virtue signaling as someone who</v>

483
00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>would would say Hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her Hashtag male feminist,</v>

484
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag.</v>

485
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.790
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those out there.</v>

486
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

487
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.300
<v Speaker 1>They're trying hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't get laid in any other way,</v>

488
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the strategy.</v>

489
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.700
<v Speaker 1>There was the strategies to position</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as the super progressive.</v>

490
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who don't want you to</v>

491
00:22:56.821 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>think that they're racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they go out of their way to</v>

492
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:02.910
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against white people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other white people when they're white.</v>

493
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing with this woman was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

494
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 1>if you are a white person and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for a job and you are up against a</v>

495
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:12.690
<v Speaker 1>person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do period not period.</v>

496
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Take that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't deserve it.</v>

497
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Examine white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

498
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.940
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Liberal Arts College do you belong</v>

499
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:23.670
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fucking crazy shit is in your head?</v>

500
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it at all.</v>

501
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Period.</v>

502
00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Take that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

503
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.580
<v Speaker 1>well you don't have to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went on a tangent.</v>

504
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.950
<v Speaker 1>We went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to find out how you</v>

505
00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:40.280
<v Speaker 1>become a life coach and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking politics,</v>

506
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 2>White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>White Knights.</v>

507
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

508
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I now I know a whole new</v>

509
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:48.150
<v Speaker 2>understanding of white nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

510
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I always understood it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

511
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 2>the man who's going to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue</v>

512
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're positioning themselves as that,</v>

513
00:23:53.491 --> 00:23:54.324
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a couple decades away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this going away because I think</v>

515
00:23:58.621 --> 00:24:00.930
<v Speaker 1>technology is going government going</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

516
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.870
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all bullshit and lies.</v>

517
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think technology is going to enable</v>

518
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 1>just like no one anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can go back to the first days of</v>

519
00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:16.860
<v Speaker 1>cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went back to the 18 hundreds,</v>

520
00:24:16.861 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>they first had a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would have ever thought that in</v>

521
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.380
<v Speaker 1>the lifespan of just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

522
00:24:22.381 --> 00:24:23.370
<v Speaker 1>what was the first camera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

523
00:24:23.371 --> 00:24:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Like 18 slash 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

524
00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Like civil war era was like the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>

525
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.640
<v Speaker 1>No one would've ever thought that in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespans,</v>

526
00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what it is from</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to now,</v>

527
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to send video to Australia</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously from something that</v>

528
00:24:40.981 --> 00:24:44.100
<v Speaker 1>slips into your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find blind when he like,</v>

529
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 1>stop</v>

530
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>to think about how much we've seen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lifetime.</v>

531
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're just so used to it.</v>

532
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.680
<v Speaker 1>We're so used to google and the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when Hillary Clinton was telling</v>

533
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.480
<v Speaker 1>like Donald Trump said something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

534
00:24:55.481 --> 00:24:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google what?</v>

535
00:24:56.861 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true,</v>

536
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and it was like how hilarious is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton is telling people to</v>

537
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Google Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

538
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.840
<v Speaker 1>that's how beautiful access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>information is today.</v>

539
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I think we are a couple decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit more away from a</v>

540
00:25:13.421 --> 00:25:18.421
<v Speaker 1>completely new paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely new way of accessing</v>

541
00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:21.310
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to submit to</v>

542
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:24.400
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a neural implant or some</v>

543
00:25:24.401 --> 00:25:28.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of augmented reality and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to read intention and</v>

544
00:25:28.991 --> 00:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be there's not gonna be</v>

545
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:33.820
<v Speaker 1>any lying 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

546
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Totally think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why we're seeing so</v>

547
00:25:36.121 --> 00:25:39.150
<v Speaker 2>many of these systems break down like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presidential election,</v>

548
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.090
<v Speaker 2>which used to be this coveted amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

549
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Now we're kind of looking at it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

550
00:25:43.951 --> 00:25:46.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a reality TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seems like now</v>

551
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>is all pussy grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craziness,</v>

552
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.130
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the believe that</v>

553
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.570
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 minutes of the second debate.</v>

554
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been out of the country for a</v>

555
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was so refreshing and to come back</v>

556
00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and I watched it and the first 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes was just character slams.</v>

557
00:26:04.261 --> 00:26:08.100
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the issues or anything and I was</v>

558
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:08.730
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

559
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.660
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening?</v>

560
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.140
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make me feel like if he</v>

561
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.950
<v Speaker 1>shits on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she shits on him and she,</v>

562
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.670
<v Speaker 1>she tears him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me feel like she's</v>

563
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:19.800
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked her and one of the debates</v>

564
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.880
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't tune into it until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last hour and he was saying a bunch of</v>

565
00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:26.730
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit and she would start laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

566
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 1>that's how she should handle him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should handle him like he's a child.</v>

567
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Like if she did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's fucking crazy too.</v>

568
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.010
<v Speaker 1>So depending president of another</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangent,</v>

569
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.930
<v Speaker 1>lots of fantasy life coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

570
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>how do you go from.</v>

571
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're running mad at both of us,</v>

572
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:48.410
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

573
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Suitable politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

574
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 3>How about you just shut the up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will totally own that.</v>

575
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not my area of expertise.</v>

576
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what nobody knows shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

577
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>even the people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Donald Trump's running for</v>

578
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody saw that common,</v>

579
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody understands this stupid</v>

580
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.660
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

581
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.400
<v Speaker 3>But You understand life coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

582
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come up with a better</v>

583
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.490
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but her name and that's our live</v>

584
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.131
<v Speaker 3>coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

585
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.160
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the way it happened is</v>

586
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.001
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

587
00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:17.990
<v Speaker 4>so I quit my job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which threw me into an even worse</v>

588
00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:20.030
<v Speaker 4>depression because that was my whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

589
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.430
<v Speaker 4>like it was my success in being an</v>
<v Speaker 4>agent.</v>

590
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.280
<v Speaker 4>And so then in a period of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

591
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.360
<v Speaker 4>like six to eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of things happened,</v>

592
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:29.420
<v Speaker 4>I went into lots of debt because I tried</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep up with this lifestyle.</v>

593
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

594
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.730
<v Speaker 4>was a strange from my family for a bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I made a choice that they didn't</v>

595
00:27:34.731 --> 00:27:37.640
<v Speaker 4>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got diagnosed with another</v>

596
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.100
<v Speaker 4>autoimmune disorder on top of everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

597
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.320
<v Speaker 4>And then I was engaged and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

598
00:27:42.321 --> 00:27:44.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's my next role.</v>

599
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.090
<v Speaker 4>I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then six months before my wedding,</v>

600
00:27:47.091 --> 00:27:50.570
<v Speaker 4>he dumped me cultivating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I in that,</v>

601
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know people listening to I've been</v>

602
00:27:52.101 --> 00:27:55.490
<v Speaker 4>through worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in that like span at 26 years old,</v>

603
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.700
<v Speaker 4>losing my career and money and family</v>
<v Speaker 4>and health and love,</v>

604
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.380
<v Speaker 4>it was Kinda like this sucks like this.</v>

605
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I really didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had honestly a moment on my</v>

606
00:28:06.921 --> 00:28:08.990
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't know why I was on my</v>

607
00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:11.530
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor was disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was laying there.</v>

608
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.910
<v Speaker 4>It's a good spot to cry the tiles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice and cold,</v>

609
00:28:13.911 --> 00:28:18.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels very dramatic and I had this</v>

610
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.630
<v Speaker 4>like kind of insight I guess you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

611
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Speaker 4>of how much I was relating to everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a total victim as like everything was</v>

612
00:28:29.451 --> 00:28:33.830
<v Speaker 4>happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it dawned on me I'm the common</v>

613
00:28:33.831 --> 00:28:36.890
<v Speaker 4>denominator in like all of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

614
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 4>So either I have just really bad luck or</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have some influence over this.</v>

615
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was just a teeny bit of an</v>

616
00:28:44.961 --> 00:28:48.470
<v Speaker 4>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was enough of a new perspective</v>

617
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.550
<v Speaker 4>on my life that kind of got me off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor and started to give me</v>

618
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:57.551
<v Speaker 4>some kind of hope and started to make me</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize I needed help and like I,</v>

619
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.930
<v Speaker 4>the way I was doing my life wasn't going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to work anymore.</v>

620
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.620
<v Speaker 4>And so I found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was having a quarter life</v>

621
00:29:03.621 --> 00:29:08.621
<v Speaker 4>crisis and I found a book by that name</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I read it and it was fine,</v>

622
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.650
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't going deep enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I decided to write a book about like</v>

623
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.740
<v Speaker 4>my experience and everything I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning and how I like was getting</v>

624
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:22.040
<v Speaker 4>myself off my bathroom floor I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was interviewing people for the</v>

625
00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:25.100
<v Speaker 4>book and they kept saying things to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

626
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.040
<v Speaker 4>can I set up a session with you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd say why I got all the</v>

627
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:28.880
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

628
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:30.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't you a coach or a counselor or</v>

629
00:29:30.171 --> 00:29:31.310
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd say no.</v>

630
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.290
<v Speaker 4>And they said you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>

631
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be.</v>

632
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.260
<v Speaker 4>And I kept hearing this over and over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

633
00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 4>So I went to my coach and kind of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>first teacher who I met when I was 22</v>

634
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 4>and I was still seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has had a major impact in my life</v>

635
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.411
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mona,</v>

636
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's telling me I should do this</v>

637
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 4>and I've been looking for my career for</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

638
00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is what I'm supposed to do.</v>

639
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.153
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep,</v>

640
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

641
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 4>And I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been coming for five years,</v>

642
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't you tell me this?</v>

643
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:57.371
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

644
00:29:57.371 --> 00:29:59.020
<v Speaker 4>you had to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to find it.</v>

645
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 4>And so that's how it just started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people kept reflecting back to me,</v>

646
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're good at this,</v>

647
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 4>you should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't really know how or what.</v>

648
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 4>And so then I just became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started studying it.</v>

649
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I apprenticed with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got training,</v>

650
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I got a master's degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote more books and it just sort of</v>

651
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 4>happened out of my own life and out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>just creating things that I thought</v>

652
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 4>would help people and people going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

653
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 4>this is really helping me and can I talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you more?</v>

654
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

655
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>a good 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 years ago.</v>

656
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Have you pushed the mic forward a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more and make the sound consistent?</v>

657
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds good in your ear.</v>

658
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Just the recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be weird.</v>

659
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It is an interesting thing that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes small choices that people</v>

660
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 1>make that dictate what happens to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their life.</v>

661
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 1>But if you just decide that things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to you,</v>

662
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't take any responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the choices.</v>

663
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.440
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me the biggest difference are people</v>

664
00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:55.640
<v Speaker 4>who are able to change their life and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who don't is ownership,</v>

665
00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 4>is realizing that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things happen but we're not victims and</v>

666
00:31:01.011 --> 00:31:03.710
<v Speaker 4>anything can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same exact thing happened to</v>

667
00:31:03.711 --> 00:31:06.950
<v Speaker 4>you and I and we can make different</v>
<v Speaker 4>choices about what we make it mean and</v>

668
00:31:06.951 --> 00:31:10.280
<v Speaker 4>how we respond to it and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>create different results based on that.</v>

669
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's not what happens to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just luck.</v>

670
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.420
<v Speaker 4>It's truly what are you going to choose</v>
<v Speaker 4>to believe about it.</v>

671
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:22.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's to me the key differentiator</v>
<v Speaker 4>between staying where you are and kind</v>

672
00:31:22.401 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 4>of regressing as you get older and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeating you're familiar patterns and</v>

673
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.460
<v Speaker 4>prints and repeat life and more stubborn</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all those things and you know,</v>

674
00:31:31.461 --> 00:31:35.870
<v Speaker 4>just looking for those short term bursts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of happiness and like a trip or a bottle</v>

675
00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:40.871
<v Speaker 4>of wine or whatever versus like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting clear about how you can change</v>

676
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your purpose is,</v>

677
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 4>what brings you joy and like who you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really are.</v>

678
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing about life coaching to</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any,</v>

679
00:31:47.871 --> 00:31:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to forget that word,</v>

680
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that your dispensing advice</v>
<v Speaker 1>or giving out inspiration or you know,</v>

681
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 1>writing things down that have affected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and helped an enhanced you,</v>

682
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 1>people want to dismiss that stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

683
00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

684
00:32:03.031 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like one of the best things</v>

685
00:32:06.931 --> 00:32:11.610
<v Speaker 1>about being a part of a community or</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a part of a culture is that you</v>

686
00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:15.360
<v Speaker 1>get to look at all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have done that have benefited</v>

687
00:32:15.361 --> 00:32:19.080
<v Speaker 1>them and all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive choices that someone is</v>

688
00:32:19.081 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 1>made and you can learn and experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>those without having to go through all</v>

689
00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 1>their bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

690
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of things that I've</v>

691
00:32:25.351 --> 00:32:29.730
<v Speaker 1>learned from people whether I've read</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they've said or listen to</v>

692
00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:32.730
<v Speaker 1>speeches that they've given about</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that they've made.</v>

693
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Where I've come across a similar moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life when my ob,</v>

694
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is,</v>

695
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

696
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the best tools that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

697
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

698
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to improving and enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life,</v>

699
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:51.551
<v Speaker 1>your own individual experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at all the different shit that</v>

700
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 1>other people have done and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird one because people dismiss</v>

701
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>it so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

702
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dismiss it at A.</v>

703
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of Hubris and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of ego attached to it</v>

704
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 1>where they don't want to admit they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue or they don't want to admit</v>

705
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 1>they need help or they don't wanna admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they need to be inspired or they</v>

706
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>need some sort of motivation.</v>

707
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

708
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

709
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.940
<v Speaker 4>That whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this life that I know is comfortable.</v>

710
00:33:20.941 --> 00:33:25.380
<v Speaker 4>I may not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm so scared of uncertainty that I</v>

711
00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:27.250
<v Speaker 4>don't want to make the changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

712
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.610
<v Speaker 4>people are terrified of the unknown.</v>

713
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 1>There's also a lot of fuckery of foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to life coaches and</v>

714
00:33:34.691 --> 00:33:38.950
<v Speaker 1>motivational speakers and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hosers like we were talking about</v>

715
00:33:38.951 --> 00:33:39.850
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast,</v>

716
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 1>about a couple of hoses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know there's hosers out there and</v>

717
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.420
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like everything else.</v>

718
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

719
00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:48.310
<v Speaker 1>there's bad car mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:51.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll put a used part and your car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you over this.</v>

721
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.680
<v Speaker 1>There's bad doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's bad everything.</v>

722
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Everything in this world as someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's half passing it.</v>

723
00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being a life coach or being</v>

724
00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:04.660
<v Speaker 1>a motivational speaker is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

725
00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:06.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get a phd to do it.</v>

726
00:34:06.551 --> 00:34:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like prove yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Mike has opened up 15 different</v>

728
00:34:11.171 --> 00:34:12.670
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's going to show you how to do a</v>

729
00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:14.650
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy's a successful</v>

730
00:34:14.651 --> 00:34:16.360
<v Speaker 1>businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

731
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.330
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are doing life coaching that are</v>

732
00:34:19.331 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking failures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

733
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And maybe maybe that's not the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world to be a failure</v>

734
00:34:24.491 --> 00:34:28.360
<v Speaker 1>because you've learned from those</v>
<v Speaker 1>failures and maybe your achievement or</v>

735
00:34:28.361 --> 00:34:33.100
<v Speaker 1>your contribution is expressing those</v>
<v Speaker 1>failures and your revelations from those</v>

736
00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:36.130
<v Speaker 1>failures and that can help somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>not make those same mistakes.</v>

737
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:36.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

738
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 4>I think I've had a lot of so called</v>
<v Speaker 4>failures and mistakes.</v>

739
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you ever have one of those like</v>

740
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 4>bathroom floor moments?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like life pivot.</v>

741
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

742
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.090
<v Speaker 4>check on the floor.</v>

743
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not all bullshit aside.</v>

744
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

745
00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.740
<v Speaker 1>there's always um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

746
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 1>for a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one is bombing.</v>

747
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Bombing on stage is devastating and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start thinking like,</v>

748
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

749
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you can only take so many of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombings in your life.</v>

750
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only get beaten up so many times</v>

751
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your brain stops working.</v>

752
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's that relationship breakups</v>

753
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:19.690
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

754
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:25.210
<v Speaker 1>devastations I think are always the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a rebirth.</v>

755
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And at the time they don't feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

756
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And devastations anything devastating</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to you in your life while</v>

757
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:34.340
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like,</v>

758
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can take this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get through it and you have</v>

759
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 1>this sort of enhanced perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also,</v>

760
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 1>we live in an amazing time where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

761
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that you should revel in other</v>

762
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.690
<v Speaker 1>people's failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could like,</v>

763
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:51.750
<v Speaker 1>look what most of your failure is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in comparison to what's going on</v>

764
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:56.700
<v Speaker 1>in a million like Syria or million</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world that are</v>

765
00:35:56.701 --> 00:36:01.701
<v Speaker 1>just filled with fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people can't see that because you</v>

766
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:05.400
<v Speaker 1>see your life and your life is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when your life is falling</v>

767
00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:05.770
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

768
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.401
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

769
00:36:06.401 --> 00:36:08.170
<v Speaker 4>and I think too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

770
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:13.390
<v Speaker 4>we get so kind of narcissistic and our</v>
<v Speaker 4>problems that we forget the bigger</v>

771
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 4>perspective and we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people talk about being happy</v>

772
00:36:18.491 --> 00:36:19.360
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be.</v>

773
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.580
<v Speaker 4>And I just don't think that that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that you,</v>

774
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I've grown and I through contrast</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

775
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.433
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

776
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I think I really understand happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy because have really understood</v>

777
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.160
<v Speaker 4>depression and sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that polarity I think is such a big</v>

778
00:36:33.161 --> 00:36:35.020
<v Speaker 4>part of what we're here for.</v>

779
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at your read a book</v>

780
00:36:37.211 --> 00:36:39.640
<v Speaker 1>about different parts of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

781
00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:41.500
<v Speaker 1>You if you're still happy to read that</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

782
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.360
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

783
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't be happy all the</v>

784
00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:47.110
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was actually,</v>

785
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was scientific America or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that that had an article</v>

786
00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:54.100
<v Speaker 1>recently saying you're not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy all the time and you shouldn't be.</v>

787
00:36:54.101 --> 00:36:55.870
<v Speaker 1>And there's an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for it.</v>

788
00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.960
<v Speaker 1>There's peaks and valleys in everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

789
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that I,</v>

790
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people listening that might be in</v>

791
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 4>one of those valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

792
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 4>don't try to just get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really ask,</v>

793
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

794
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.210
<v Speaker 4>what can I learn from this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my biggest thing is I stopped</v>

795
00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:17.750
<v Speaker 4>asking why is this happening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And started asking,</v>

796
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.883
<v Speaker 4>what can I learn?</v>

797
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of painting yourself as a</v>

798
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:23.260
<v Speaker 1>victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you paint yourself as someone who's</v>

799
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>present in the moment and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

800
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out what's going on.</v>

801
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we don't.</v>

802
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times we don't have the tools</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where things like life</v>

803
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 4>coaching and personal development come</v>
<v Speaker 4>in handy is cause we can go and get</v>

804
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.550
<v Speaker 4>those tools instead of using our old</v>
<v Speaker 4>coping mechanisms by like being strong</v>

805
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:41.080
<v Speaker 4>or overseen overworking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overdrinking over,</v>

806
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.920
<v Speaker 4>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping into a relationship like</v>

807
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.150
<v Speaker 4>whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

808
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.420
<v Speaker 4>we don't really learn how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointment,</v>

809
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 4>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger or shame,</v>

810
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 4>any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're kind of left to these quick</v>

811
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 4>fix devices that in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a big reason addiction is</v>

812
00:37:56.821 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 4>such a problem is because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really learn how to manage emotion and</v>

813
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 4>how to manage this appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we go for that thing that makes</v>

814
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 4>us feel better in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is we have to keep</v>

815
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 4>upping the ante.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

816
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.260
<v Speaker 4>at first that one glass of wine does the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trick,</v>

817
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 4>but then you need to then you need</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

818
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 4>then you add vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they whatever it may be.</v>

819
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

820
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 4>why I'm so passionate about what I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

821
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

822
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I never thought I could be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I really didn't.</v>

823
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

824
00:38:28.691 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I was going to be depressed and I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>was gonna constantly be looking for</v>

825
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:38.601
<v Speaker 4>something to fix me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never really truly thought this life</v>

826
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 4>that I'm living now was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

827
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 4>externally things look fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But internally I'm talking about a</v>

828
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:49.111
<v Speaker 4>totally different kind of experience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only because of those like really</v>

829
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 4>awful moments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call them expectation hangovers that I</v>

830
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:58.591
<v Speaker 4>was kind of desperate enough to let go</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my normal coping mechanisms and my</v>

831
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 4>trying to control everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the ultimate and surrender</v>

832
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 4>truly of going okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't,</v>

833
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to find a different way to deal</v>

834
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 4>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really what has led me down</v>

835
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 4>the path that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I am today.</v>

836
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

837
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that life coaching and the</v>

838
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 4>personal transformation industry and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

839
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of,</v>

840
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 4>what'd you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoke cookies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I hardly ever use that.</v>

849
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

850
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I want to go back to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The PROZAC?</v>

851
00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

852
00:39:49.501 --> 00:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm super.</v>

853
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Your parents put you on that stuff when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 10 years old.</v>

854
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I think it was more the doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doctors.</v>

855
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your doctors put you on that stuff when</v>

856
00:39:57.721 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 3>you were 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tests and blood tests.</v>

857
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 3>What do you see a demon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you see?</v>

858
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you see?</v>

859
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 3>A skull?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably said things like a butterfly</v>

860
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 3>of pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate from school with fucking ax in</v>

861
00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:15.210
<v Speaker 3>her head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the doctor puts you on PROZAC.</v>

862
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:16.740
<v Speaker 3>And what kind of an effect does that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have on you?</v>

863
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually helped.</v>

864
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.250
<v Speaker 4>It really helped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it helped me.</v>

865
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gosh,</v>

866
00:40:24.241 --> 00:40:25.650
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to remember too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

867
00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:27.870
<v Speaker 4>I was 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I talked to my parents about</v>

868
00:40:27.871 --> 00:40:28.261
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

869
00:40:28.261 --> 00:40:30.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did help because I really do think</v>

870
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.880
<v Speaker 4>that because of everything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>

871
00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:34.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain chemistry did shift,</v>

872
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that we can shift our brain</v>

873
00:40:37.321 --> 00:40:39.690
<v Speaker 4>chemistry with repetitive thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

874
00:40:39.691 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 4>I had enough thoughts about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

875
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not likable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had just intense inner critic in my</v>

876
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:50.040
<v Speaker 4>head and I do think that shifted my</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain chemistry and I do think that the</v>

877
00:40:50.041 --> 00:40:53.550
<v Speaker 4>medicine helped me at least get to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>point where,</v>

878
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like kind of awake again.</v>

879
00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.300
<v Speaker 4>How long does it take?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember,</v>

880
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.370
<v Speaker 4>but I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

881
00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:04.980
<v Speaker 4>especially in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm still on it.</v>

882
00:41:04.981 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on it until 30.</v>

883
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on every from every.</v>

884
00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.410
<v Speaker 4>I was on Prozac,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wellbutrin</v>

885
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.510
<v Speaker 3>for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 from the time you were 10.</v>

886
00:41:15.511 --> 00:41:17.040
<v Speaker 3>So all through high school you run that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>

887
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

888
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:19.501
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

889
00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I believed that I needed it just like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>diabetic would take insulin.</v>

890
00:41:23.901 --> 00:41:27.950
<v Speaker 4>So how long ago did you get off of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A seven and a half years ago.</v>

891
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

892
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.430
<v Speaker 4>and like totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

893
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 4>I never have any regression or dips but</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

894
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 4>I was super intentional about getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>off of it.</v>

895
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I didn't just stop like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after 20 years.</v>

896
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.630
<v Speaker 4>It took me a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took a lot of the emotional work that</v>

897
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 4>I was doing with my coach Mona because</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much of depression is suppression so</v>

898
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff was happening.</v>

899
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 4>I think I was pretty angry about it but</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no outlet for that,</v>

900
00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 4>especially as a girl like boys again can</v>
<v Speaker 4>go out and get stuff out.</v>

901
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is why I think so many women</v>

902
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 4>get irritable and bitchy and all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of things is because women,</v>

903
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 4>we don't have like that outlet for</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger.</v>

904
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 4>And so we internalize a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we can do sadness but anger a lot</v>

905
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:17.201
<v Speaker 4>of times gets suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of like me getting off my</v>

906
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 4>medicine and not feeling depressed was</v>
<v Speaker 4>not being suppressed.</v>

907
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Exercise the exercise is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but until you like go back and actually</v>

908
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 4>process the emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

909
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 4>exercise is good in terms of moving the</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>

910
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times you have to attach</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the feeling with the movement,</v>

911
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like a lot of my retreats that I do</v>

912
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.620
<v Speaker 4>where I just bring women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I facilitate like an anger barn for</v>

913
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:41.190
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger,</v>

914
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.103
<v Speaker 4>burn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>

915
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like a safe place for women to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>their anger out.</v>

916
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just catharsis,</v>

917
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 4>like there's a whole kind of process I</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them through so they like,</v>

918
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of reconnect maybe earlier life</v>

919
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 4>experiences where they didn't feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>protected or they felt unsafe or they</v>

920
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 4>felt you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abused or whatever that is.</v>

921
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is just,</v>

922
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 4>this all comes from my own life</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in working with,</v>

923
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people at this point.</v>

924
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see over and over again.</v>

925
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:14.920
<v Speaker 4>People that are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut down,</v>

926
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not happy with their life,</v>

927
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 4>have some like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unprocessed thing from their past that</v>

928
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:26.300
<v Speaker 4>just needs to move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I create this space for people</v>

929
00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:31.301
<v Speaker 4>to start to move that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like underneath there is creativity</v>

930
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:36.080
<v Speaker 4>and passion and peace and freedom from</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and all that kind of stuff.</v>

931
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.470
<v Speaker 4>So when you're looking at me like</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's looking at me like,</v>

932
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 4>who is this girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when people have that space to</v>

933
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 4>unleash that and to let the energy move</v>
<v Speaker 4>through them because I think there's a</v>

934
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:57.401
<v Speaker 4>difference between emotion and feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So feelings to me,</v>

935
00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 4>our physiological responses to thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

936
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:06.101
<v Speaker 4>So if I sit here and think about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future of that I'm scared about,</v>

937
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to feel anxiety.</v>

938
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 4>If I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

939
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 4>what if someone breaks into my house</v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight,</v>

940
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:13.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to feel fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

941
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:14.450
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

942
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I can feel regret because of a thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>or guilt.</v>

943
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but emotion like energy in motion,</v>

944
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:25.390
<v Speaker 4>if someone hurts one of your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to experience anger.</v>

945
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a natural response.</v>

946
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Someone close to us dies or we have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>heartbreak.</v>

947
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 4>It's natural to feel the emotion of</v>
<v Speaker 4>sadness.</v>

948
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 4>And I think that there's a lot of kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of misleading information about like,</v>

949
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we create all our feelings with our</v>

950
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and we can just affirm our way</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of things and think our way out of</v>

951
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to some degree that's true.</v>

952
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Changing our thinking does a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with,</v>

953
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 4>with some core emotions like anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>

954
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:54.270
<v Speaker 4>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we got to feel them and I think</v>

955
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 4>that that's what people are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>scared of is actually kind of opening</v>

956
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 4>that box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening that can of worms and going back</v>

957
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 4>and actually feeling those feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is they're in there.</v>

958
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 4>And so if you don't get them up and out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a healthy way,</v>

959
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 4>then I think that's what creates a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of suppression,</v>

960
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 4>a lot of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps,</v>

961
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 4>maybe even disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that because they just get</v>

962
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 4>stored in our body somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>

963
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do to these gals?</v>

964
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 4>What do I do to these gals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

965
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just creating the space.</v>

966
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.530
<v Speaker 4>They just scream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

967
00:45:27.531 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a pill.</v>

968
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I give them.</v>

969
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I definitely give them something to hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

970
00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:36.850
<v Speaker 4>like in those foam noodles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

971
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 4>that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do and oh gosh,</v>

972
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 4>the comments to this are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

973
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.580
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here we go.</v>

974
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:49.730
<v Speaker 4>So I um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I put on some pretty intense music</v>

975
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know.</v>

976
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Not slayer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not slayer.</v>

977
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Slayer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more like,</v>

978
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Speaker 4>it's more like metallica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Metallica is on my playlist.</v>

979
00:46:01.681 --> 00:46:02.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can pull up my place.</v>

980
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.570
<v Speaker 4>I really want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

981
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 4>you have a beat the shit out of a foam</v>
<v Speaker 4>roller.</v>

982
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.613
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

983
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

984
00:46:10.331 --> 00:46:11.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

985
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burned platelets.</v>

986
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burned playlist.</v>

987
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm telling you a little bit about</v>

988
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

989
00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.220
<v Speaker 4>So one time I was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rented a house actually out in the</v>

990
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 4>near here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Gaura and people were doing this</v>

991
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 4>process and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I prep them,</v>

992
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:25.891
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

993
00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

994
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 4>they bring to mind things that they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

995
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:33.090
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're angry about things from their</v>

996
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.100
<v Speaker 4>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

997
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 4>it's not just like a throw them in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>room with loud music and say go after</v>

998
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're very,</v>

999
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:40.590
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of processes I put them</v>
<v Speaker 4>through to get them to this point.</v>

1000
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're doing this one time in this</v>

1001
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:47.721
<v Speaker 4>house and there's like 20 women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loud music yelling and um,</v>

1002
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>the cops show up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1003
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.660
<v Speaker 4>the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you like,</v>

1004
00:46:57.661 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 4>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I step out,</v>

1005
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I stepped out and I explained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1006
00:47:01.831 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times I,</v>

1007
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:05.460
<v Speaker 4>this is a women's workshop and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

1008
00:47:05.461 --> 00:47:05.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1009
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 4>we hold back our emotions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ended up getting irritable and it's</v>

1010
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 4>just as healthy way for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to heal and work on their emotions.</v>

1011
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 4>And the cop looks at me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I have your card?</v>

1012
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I want to send my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No kidding.</v>

1013
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what the cop said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is.</v>

1014
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 4>And I've gotten lots of calls from</v>
<v Speaker 4>husbands and boyfriends and even kids</v>

1015
00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 4>and like thank you because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about,</v>

1016
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 4>it's like pulling off our armor</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>

1017
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:39.090
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about doing like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deeper work and kind of going to</v>

1018
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.090
<v Speaker 4>those scary places that takes a layer</v>
<v Speaker 4>off of us.</v>

1019
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:46.980
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's similar to plant medicine,</v>

1020
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways of going to those places</v>
<v Speaker 4>where that are Kinda like,</v>

1021
00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you come out the other side and</v>

1022
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 4>you have a deeper understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of yourself.</v>

1023
00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.733
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1024
00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.160
<v Speaker 1>so by doing something completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and crazy and just letting</v>

1025
00:48:02.161 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 1>loose and all the madness involved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1026
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:05.970
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a reset</v>

1027
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.020
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not,</v>

1029
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:10.220
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's facilitated.</v>

1030
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this crazy,</v>

1031
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people going into screaming,</v>

1032
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.000
<v Speaker 4>it's not fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not because there's a difference</v>

1033
00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:20.330
<v Speaker 4>between catharsis and like actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>processing stuff,</v>

1034
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1035
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:27.611
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't really understand emotion to a</v>

1036
00:48:28.101 --> 00:48:33.101
<v Speaker 4>certain level and we think that big</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion is crazy and it's not</v>

1037
00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:36.560
<v Speaker 4>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what is crazy,</v>

1038
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.630
<v Speaker 4>what makes people crazy is suppressing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it their whole life and trying to manage</v>

1039
00:48:41.631 --> 00:48:46.631
<v Speaker 4>it through their mind or through doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>things or through whatever else versus</v>

1040
00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:51.680
<v Speaker 4>actually like being willing to look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>those parts of ourselves because we're,</v>

1041
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're humans.</v>

1042
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:54.560
<v Speaker 4>We have a mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have emotions,</v>

1043
00:48:54.561 --> 00:48:55.580
<v Speaker 4>we have actions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

1044
00:48:55.581 --> 00:48:56.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our spiritual self,</v>

1045
00:48:56.991 --> 00:48:59.210
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something that's connected to</v>

1046
00:48:59.211 --> 00:49:03.620
<v Speaker 4>something bigger than us and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 4>need a holistic approach to really</v>

1047
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1048
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the time that you decided to get</v>

1049
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 1>off of the antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you follow a protocol?</v>

1050
00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to a doctor to discuss it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them?</v>

1051
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you read anything about how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and what advice would you give to</v>

1052
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>anybody out there that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening that also is going through</v>

1053
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 1>that same sort of situation?</v>

1054
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctors told me I couldn't do it,</v>

1055
00:49:24.051 --> 00:49:24.320
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

1056
00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 1>definitely good doctors ever stay on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting paid exactly.</v>

1057
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had,</v>

1058
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my coach at the time,</v>

1059
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 4>he was really helpful who more than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1060
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 4>like coaches such like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what to call her.</v>

1061
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:39.670
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did you find her?</v>

1062
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I was dating a guy who was an addict and</v>
<v Speaker 4>complaining about him to girlfriend at</v>

1063
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:51.440
<v Speaker 4>lunch for like the 80th time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said pill.</v>

1064
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 4>No drugs like coke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

1065
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe pills and pills to fun times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good Times.</v>

1066
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Great.</v>

1067
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was popping xanax while he was doing</v>

1068
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:06.940
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1069
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1070
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.570
<v Speaker 4>I've totally lost my train of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1071
00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:11.550
<v Speaker 4>how'd you find your coach?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1072
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to find a coach.</v>

1073
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>So we're sitting at lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about this for the 80th time</v>

1074
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.260
<v Speaker 4>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1075
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 4>I can't listen to this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went and saw this kind of cookie woman</v>

1076
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.823
<v Speaker 4>go see her.</v>

1077
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 4>So and I had been to shrinks my whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>life and I'd never been to like a coach.</v>

1078
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 4>I had always been to therapists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrists and so nothing against</v>

1079
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:32.840
<v Speaker 4>therapists and psychiatrists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do good work,</v>

1080
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.940
<v Speaker 4>but I had kind of like reached my limit</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it and so I go to this woman's</v>

1081
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 4>house and she's like totally stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 4>1985,</v>

1082
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 4>like her decor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her fashion,</v>

1083
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I sit down and I sit across from her</v>

1084
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 4>and she didn't even see me in a normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>

1085
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:51.420
<v Speaker 4>I think she knew she needed to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally get me out of my comfort zone.</v>

1086
00:50:51.421 --> 00:50:55.550
<v Speaker 4>So she put me in her son's bedroom with</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these race car bunk beds and I'm</v>

1087
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:56.980
<v Speaker 4>sitting there on this race car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunk bed,</v>

1088
00:50:56.981 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 4>the going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where am I,</v>

1089
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 4>how did I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she walks in and she sits in front</v>

1090
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 4>of me and it was the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life and I felt loved by my parents.</v>

1091
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 4>This was the first time in my life I</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt really seen,</v>

1092
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 4>like it was almost uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this woman could almost see through</v>

1093
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could see me,</v>

1094
00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 4>she could really see me and I felt zero</v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment from her,</v>

1095
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:22.210
<v Speaker 4>like zero and although is scary and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit because it was like kind of,</v>

1096
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 4>I felt very vulnerable if there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>something so reassuring about it because</v>

1097
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:33.080
<v Speaker 4>she was the first like practitioner I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had seen that didn't see me as broken.</v>

1098
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.800
<v Speaker 4>She really just saw me and she was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that in so many ways helped me over</v>

1099
00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:41.810
<v Speaker 4>the years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get off the medication by teaching me</v>

1100
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:43.640
<v Speaker 4>how to release my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1101
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.700
<v Speaker 4>by helping me understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 4>bad feelings aren't necessarily bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also got very clear about my diet,</v>

1103
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 4>like I got off gluten because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times gluten can impact brain chemistry.</v>

1104
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped drinking.</v>

1105
00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't never a big drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I stopped drinking for about two</v>

1106
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 4>years because alcohol's a depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd always been into exercise and</v>

1107
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 4>fitness and eating healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything like that.</v>

1108
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I also started meditating and</v>

1109
00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 4>like finding some kind of connection to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a higher power.</v>

1110
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:15.350
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really have a name for it at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

1111
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 4>but something where I didn't feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was so alone because that was kind of</v>

1112
00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 4>one of the scary things about</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

1113
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 4>you feel you feel alone a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1114
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 4>And so it was a combination of all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things that over time and the</v>

1115
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 4>belief that I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really had to change my belief that I</v>

1116
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 4>could get off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1117
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 4>so for people that are considering it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1118
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 4>don't just stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1119
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 4>it's dangerous just to stop because that</v>
<v Speaker 4>can really mess with your brain</v>

1120
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find somebody who knows something about</v>

1121
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:49.520
<v Speaker 4>this and can put you on a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can help you,</v>

1122
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:51.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a doctor,</v>

1123
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to get met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get given medical advice so,</v>

1124
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consulted doctor.</v>

1125
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me it was number one,</v>

1126
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 4>the belief that I could and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finding the people that could really</v>

1127
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:07.760
<v Speaker 4>support me and number three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making the lifestyle changes that I</v>

1128
00:53:07.761 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 4>needed to make to support it and being</v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to go to that dark,</v>

1129
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 4>scary place that I was afraid to go to.</v>

1130
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.920
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by when you say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the first person who didn't see</v>

1131
00:53:19.921 --> 00:53:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you as broken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do what do you mean by they all?</v>

1132
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.140
<v Speaker 1>They all saw you as broken</v>

1133
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:28.850
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1134
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.180
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I would go to one of these doctors</v>

1135
00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 4>or therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they'd see that I was on</v>

1136
00:53:34.881 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 4>medication since I was 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1137
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.360
<v Speaker 4>they kind of relate to me in that way.</v>

1138
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Like as a person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1139
00:53:43.331 --> 00:53:45.070
<v Speaker 1>just more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had a label,</v>

1140
00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why they weren't willing</v>

1141
00:53:48.431 --> 00:53:50.440
<v Speaker 1>to consider you getting off of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

1142
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.870
<v Speaker 1>He felt like the medication is a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

1143
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.510
<v Speaker 1>You've got to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a daily thing.</v>

1144
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like brushing your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to stop.</v>

1145
00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:57.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1146
00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what they were</v>

1147
00:53:59.051 --> 00:54:03.880
<v Speaker 4>thinking and I just know how it felt and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just did it and it maybe it was</v>

1148
00:54:03.881 --> 00:54:05.920
<v Speaker 4>because like at the time I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it yet either.</v>

1149
00:54:05.921 --> 00:54:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I need to someone who believed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1150
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I do think that also the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with people everyday,</v>

1151
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.240
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a psychologist or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist or whatever,</v>

1152
00:54:14.241 --> 00:54:18.190
<v Speaker 1>that you're so inundated with people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fucking problems that after a</v>

1153
00:54:18.191 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 1>while you just become overwhelmed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to see people like</v>

1154
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.220
<v Speaker 1>and have a fresh reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you see something like this</v>

1155
00:54:25.221 --> 00:54:26.780
<v Speaker 1>is a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her name is Christine.</v>

1156
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey Christine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with you?</v>

1157
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1158
00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:31.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrists.</v>

1159
00:54:31.671 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 4>They have hard jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like imagine your whole day is person</v>

1160
00:54:35.031 --> 00:54:38.360
<v Speaker 4>after person talking about what's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 4>with their life.</v>

1161
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:42.500
<v Speaker 4>You know that that can be very draining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when I first started as a life</v>

1162
00:54:42.501 --> 00:54:44.420
<v Speaker 4>coach and I saw person after person</v>
<v Speaker 4>after person,</v>

1163
00:54:44.421 --> 00:54:49.421
<v Speaker 4>I really had to learn not to take that</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and not to let it drain me.</v>

1164
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so again,</v>

1165
00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 4>like I have a lot of respect for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>mom's a therapist,</v>

1166
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:57.710
<v Speaker 4>so I have a lot of respect for</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapists and psychiatrists are very</v>

1167
00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:02.711
<v Speaker 4>helpful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think for me in my life journey</v>

1168
00:55:03.141 --> 00:55:05.330
<v Speaker 4>and what I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1169
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to spend the rest of my</v>

1170
00:55:08.151 --> 00:55:10.760
<v Speaker 4>life medicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really didn't.</v>

1171
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So what is the difference between life</v>
<v Speaker 1>on medication and life off medication</v>

1172
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 1>and how long has the process of weaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself?</v>

1173
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it took me,</v>

1174
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:26.780
<v Speaker 4>it took me a good two years to feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was finally kind of out of my system.</v>

1175
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long was it before you were actually</v>

1176
00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:31.480
<v Speaker 1>stopping taking it?</v>

1177
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I,</v>

1178
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:34.723
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

1179
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.940
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I,</v>

1180
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:40.260
<v Speaker 4>I probably weaned for a good six months</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was like a year and a half</v>

1181
00:55:40.261 --> 00:55:42.450
<v Speaker 4>until I felt like it was like cleared</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of my system.</v>

1182
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for six months you slowly wean</v>

1183
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself off of it and then at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of six months you're not taking the</v>

1184
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>medication anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still feel foggy.</v>

1185
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you feel?</v>

1186
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish it was,</v>

1187
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.620
<v Speaker 4>it was like my system was recalibrating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1188
00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:58.580
<v Speaker 4>all my brain chemistry was recalibrating</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1189
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 4>because that stuff affects your brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry.</v>

1190
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 4>It affected my hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>

1191
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.140
<v Speaker 4>it just affected a lot.</v>

1192
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So did you take like one pill and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it down to three quarters of a pill?</v>

1193
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I did consult to a psychiatrist and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave me like a winning plan.</v>

1194
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1195
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 4>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not a standard thing,</v>

1196
00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:21.990
<v Speaker 4>like different psychiatrists will tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>you different things.</v>

1197
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 4>So it depends on what you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long you've been on it,</v>

1198
00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:27.900
<v Speaker 4>which medication you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the side effects for for it are</v>

1199
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it feel like when you're first</v>

1200
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 4>day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No pills.</v>

1201
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the first day I woke up and I</v>

1202
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:41.680
<v Speaker 4>felt clear like I felt like scientology</v>
<v Speaker 4>clear.</v>

1203
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to keep getting kicked out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of here.</v>

1204
00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1205
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.970
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was like out of me and I was</v>

1206
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

1207
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 4>I just felt like a fog and a heaviness</v>
<v Speaker 4>had lifted.</v>

1208
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 4>It just fell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also felt like</v>

1209
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I had deeper access to my creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my intuition and all those things were</v>

1210
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 4>present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just,</v>

1211
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 4>there was just sort of like some white</v>
<v Speaker 4>noise there.</v>

1212
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 4>And I also like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression manifested as being</v>

1213
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 4>incredibly self critical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like super self critical,</v>

1214
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 4>like this very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1215
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:24.550
<v Speaker 4>very loud inner critic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that started to lift too.</v>

1216
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:26.260
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing all kinds of other work at</v>

1217
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 4>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1218
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:30.880
<v Speaker 4>I was studying with my life coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was getting a master's degree in</v>

1219
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 4>spiritual psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1220
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 4>what is spiritual psychology?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1221
00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>

1222
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.580
<v Speaker 4>this place called the University of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa Monica and I didn't know anything</v>

1223
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 4>about this place but I had been a life</v>
<v Speaker 4>coach and I thought okay,</v>

1224
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 4>if I'm helping people with their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to know how to help them deal</v>

1225
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:47.674
<v Speaker 4>with their past.</v>

1226
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.880
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't just work on present and</v>
<v Speaker 4>future without like having some skills</v>

1227
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 4>for dealing with your past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was researching schools.</v>

1228
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I thought if I could get a master's</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree in psychology that would help me</v>

1229
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 4>and that would be good for my career and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things to have some</v>

1230
00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 4>credentials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I researched and I find this school</v>

1231
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't really know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1232
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:06.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great.</v>

1233
00:58:06.251 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 4>And the spiritual part didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with any religion or</v>

1234
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was more of the premise of,</v>

1235
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that traditional psychology is,</v>

1236
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.870
<v Speaker 4>is kind of a little bit more about</v>
<v Speaker 4>labels and,</v>

1237
00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.380
<v Speaker 4>and spiritual psychology is more people</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the inner resources they need to to</v>

1238
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 4>heal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't again,</v>

1239
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 4>didn't know much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show up at this school with my laptop</v>

1240
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:30.070
<v Speaker 4>thinking I'm going to like take notes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's going to be lectures,</v>

1241
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.110
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are no desks.</v>

1242
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.980
<v Speaker 4>It was a highly experiential school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I said,</v>

1243
00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:40.981
<v Speaker 4>a two year program and in that I really</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned how to um,</v>

1244
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.400
<v Speaker 4>change my belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heal stuff from my past,</v>

1245
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 4>connect to a part of me because we all</v>
<v Speaker 4>have like our basic self,</v>

1246
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:51.210
<v Speaker 4>like our conscious part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

1247
00:58:51.211 --> 00:58:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I believe we also have something deeper</v>
<v Speaker 4>like art,</v>

1248
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.890
<v Speaker 4>we can call it her intuition and we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>call it our gut feeling.</v>

1249
00:58:56.891 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 4>We can call it our authentic self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some kind of inner wisdom</v>

1250
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 4>that I think all of us have access to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this program really helped me get</v>

1251
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 4>more access to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that part of me.</v>

1252
00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 4>So that I could start listening to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than my old conditioning.</v>

1253
00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:15.040
<v Speaker 4>My old belief system is my old fears</v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

1254
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're born we're kind of this blank</v>

1255
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:22.681
<v Speaker 4>slate and then stuff happens and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>formed these stories about our lives and</v>

1256
00:59:23.091 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 4>who we are and how we get love and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get validation and how we get</v>

1257
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 4>acceptance and how life works and who we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and our identity and it's kind of</v>

1258
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 4>just a story and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can change that story,</v>

1259
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 4>but it takes work.</v>

1260
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Going back and deconstructing that story</v>
<v Speaker 4>and letting go of some old beliefs that</v>

1261
00:59:41.031 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe we've hung onto to create a</v>
<v Speaker 4>different one.</v>

1262
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what so much of my journey has</v>

1263
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 4>been about is kind of looking at what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story I've created about my life and</v>

1264
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 4>how can I change it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the story that I had was I'm</v>

1265
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1266
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be achieving all the time.</v>

1267
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Being hard on myself with how I motivate</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

1268
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.010
<v Speaker 4>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm constantly rejected</v>

1269
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Blahblahblahblahblah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by believing that story,</v>

1270
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 4>it was creating results in my life that</v>
<v Speaker 4>align,</v>

1271
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aligned with that.</v>

1272
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.920
<v Speaker 4>And so to create different results,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to have a different story to tell.</v>

1273
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this shift that that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take place and it's like turning a</v>

1274
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>battleship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1275
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a quick thing.</v>

1276
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>

1277
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1278
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.920
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's another,</v>

1279
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of let downs people have when they</v>

1280
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 4>go to a seminar or read one book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they expected change overnight and it's</v>

1281
01:00:34.861 --> 01:00:35.850
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a process.</v>

1282
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1283
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told this story before,</v>

1284
01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>but she was so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's friends with my friend Kelly,</v>

1285
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirsten,</v>

1286
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you know Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian comedian,</v>

1287
01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>funny girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1288
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was at the comedy store one night</v>

1289
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

1290
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>she was talking to Kelly and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to her and she started</v>

1291
01:00:55.901 --> 01:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>going on about her future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that she was going to do,</v>

1292
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>she was going to be married within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1293
01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>She was going to have the career that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants.</v>

1294
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>She was going to this and that and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

1295
01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so confused and she was like,</v>

1296
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I found the secret I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>do you know about the secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1298
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1299
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the power of positive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that kind of thing.</v>

1300
01:01:19.961 --> 01:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that,</v>

1301
01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not just positive thinking.</v>

1302
01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do create your own future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create your own identity,</v>

1303
01:01:26.801 --> 01:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create reality.</v>

1304
01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:30.244
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1305
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

1306
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know,</v>

1307
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm positive.</v>

1308
01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1309
01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1310
01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>the problem with all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1311
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>if you've never heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what do they,</v>

1312
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the term for it?</v>

1313
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to achieve law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction.</v>

1314
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1315
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to achieve is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to,</v>

1316
01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the photo of your dream house,</v>

1317
01:01:52.391 --> 01:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you pin it on your wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a photo of a Ferrari,</v>

1318
01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you pin that on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get those things.</v>

1319
01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you watch those</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

1320
01:02:00.881 --> 01:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1321
01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:07.021
<v Speaker 1>I had this photo of my home on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the Ferrari that I wanted,</v>

1322
01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I had my dream life.</v>

1323
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Now I have those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1324
01:02:11.671 --> 01:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I made those things happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention and with thought.</v>

1325
01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you know many fucking people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo of a beautiful house on the wall</v>

1326
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>and a Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got no fucking house and they</v>

1327
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>got no Ferrari and they never will like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1328
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it from a biased pool of</v>

1329
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>successful people who will tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened to them.</v>

1330
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>But there are literally millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who think positive and nothing</v>

1331
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>ever happens to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this girl who,</v>

1332
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very nice person,</v>

1333
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>she came to one of my shows like a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>later and we're hanging out outside and</v>

1334
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's everything when you're doing?</v>

1335
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1336
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it's really a drag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>because I was convinced that by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>time I would have all these things,</v>

1338
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

1339
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 1>he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and this and that and I've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this problem,</v>

1341
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 1>that problem and I just don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1342
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that I was so sure.</v>

1343
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>And we had this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1344
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like two different people.</v>

1345
01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I got met her twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1346
01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:20.031
<v Speaker 1>So I meet her this one time and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a glow with this delusion that now</v>

1347
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>she's got it and she's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

1348
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought also that talking about it</v>

1349
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>all the time was part of how you affirm</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1350
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be married in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>

1352
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm following the secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kept saying it and it was.</v>

1353
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later she was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1354
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we had this sort of heart to</v>

1355
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>heart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't talked to her again and I don't</v>

1356
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>know what the hell happened to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never forget it because the two</v>

1357
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1358
01:03:46.881 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl who was like,</v>

1359
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 1>it was kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda crazy.</v>

1360
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1361
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>why I didn't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later,</v>

1362
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.810
<v Speaker 1>year and a half I think just wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and life was still kind of</v>

1363
01:03:59.811 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>

1364
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't understand why the career</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen and alive didn't happen.</v>

1365
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all,</v>

1366
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a slow shift.</v>

1367
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:14.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a slow shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the law of attraction can be</v>

1368
01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:16.930
<v Speaker 4>misleading because it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1369
01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:21.931
<v Speaker 4>change takes more than I put a picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and I do some positive affirmations</v>

1370
01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 4>if like down deep you don't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're worthy or you're,</v>

1371
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.180
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to attract</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

1372
01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:35.170
<v Speaker 4>You've got to like Kinda go back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with core issues and core belief</v>

1373
01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.660
<v Speaker 4>systems in order to shift things in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1374
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was as easy as putting pictures up</v>

1375
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:41.740
<v Speaker 4>on our wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody would have,</v>

1376
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lamborghinis and hot and wives and</v>

1377
01:04:43.871 --> 01:04:44.710
<v Speaker 4>husbands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1378
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.730
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes,</v>

1379
01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.940
<v Speaker 4>it takes more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes being willing to like do some</v>

1380
01:04:48.941 --> 01:04:53.620
<v Speaker 4>work and take some responsibility rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>than just thinking the universe is Santa</v>

1381
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Claus and just going to pop something</v>
<v Speaker 4>into your life</v>

1382
01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>to people that are morbidly obese that</v>
<v Speaker 1>want a six pack,</v>

1383
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>like it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be done.</v>

1384
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But God damn you got a long road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1385
01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>if you want to climb Mount Everest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting in Santa Monica,</v>

1386
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa fucking get to Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1387
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's when people ask me,</v>

1388
01:05:15.231 --> 01:05:16.880
<v Speaker 4>how'd you get off antidepressants?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like,</v>

1389
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 4>oh well I just did this and then I did</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and then I this,</v>

1390
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was years of like,</v>

1391
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deciding I was going to and having the</v>

1392
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:27.370
<v Speaker 4>right people around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

1393
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably the hardest thing I've</v>

1394
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:30.484
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1395
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Now what is the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants and Xanax?</v>

1396
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you were taking both.</v>

1397
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need the Xanax if you're</v>

1398
01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>already pilled up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants?</v>

1399
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1400
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:43.490
<v Speaker 4>not an MD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not my territory,</v>

1401
01:05:43.491 --> 01:05:47.600
<v Speaker 4>but for me like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the antidepressants just kind of kept me</v>

1402
01:05:47.601 --> 01:05:52.601
<v Speaker 4>steady but then with my boyfriend at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and my crazy Hollywood life,</v>

1403
01:05:53.781 --> 01:05:56.780
<v Speaker 4>like I just had so much anxiety and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you go to a doctor and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have so much anxiety though.</v>

1405
01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to or how do you define</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety?</v>

1406
01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Worried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Worried,</v>

1407
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.020
<v Speaker 4>worried a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of high,</v>

1408
01:06:06.021 --> 01:06:09.020
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not able to calm down.</v>

1409
01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1410
01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:13.040

<v Speaker 4>Just normal,</v>

1411
01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:15.140
<v Speaker 4>like anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't have tools.</v>

1412
01:06:15.141 --> 01:06:20.141
<v Speaker 4>Then my tools then we're medicine</v>
<v Speaker 4>now had better tools.</v>

1413
01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>So now do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you take anything?</v>

1414
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1415
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And supplements,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like all that stuff.</v>

1421
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever miss it?</v>

1422
01:06:43.191 --> 01:06:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Like is there ever a time we like God</v>
<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

1423
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Popping Xanax and fucking glasses?</v>

1424
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1425
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I will say this though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I had my eyes,</v>

1426
01:06:50.731 --> 01:06:54.060
<v Speaker 4>lasix lace Vino,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lasik and they gave me,</v>

1427
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

1428
01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.970
<v Speaker 4>And how's this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see why people get addicted to this.</v>

1429
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.480
<v Speaker 4>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad they did because I was super</v>

1430
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.780
<v Speaker 4>freaked out about them cutting my</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyeball open and value them.</v>

1431
01:07:06.781 --> 01:07:09.930
<v Speaker 4>Just relax as you rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've felt great and then the only</v>

1432
01:07:09.931 --> 01:07:11.310
<v Speaker 4>time I ever did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

1433
01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't miss that because what I have</v>
<v Speaker 4>now is um,</v>

1434
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.090
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel clear and alive and you don't</v>

1435
01:07:21.091 --> 01:07:23.370
<v Speaker 4>feel happy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have my days,</v>

1436
01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.460
<v Speaker 4>but I don't relate to it as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>

1437
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:27.871
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1438
01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:29.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1439
01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:31.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human experience not having the best.</v>

1440
01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I think stories like there's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring to people.</v>

1441
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want.</v>

1442
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's hard for people to look</v>

1443
01:07:38.551 --> 01:07:42.330
<v Speaker 1>at people who aren't doing well and talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and just go,</v>

1444
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell you a good</v>

1445
01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:45.810
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get the fuck away from this</v>

1446
01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:46.421
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1447
01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:48.690
<v Speaker 1>like that's how people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to deal with her.</v>

1448
01:07:48.691 --> 01:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Problems are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His problems are I,</v>

1449
01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I want to separate my and</v>

1450
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.480
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think when someone like you can</v>

1451
01:07:57.481 --> 01:08:01.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of express how you were in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad state and yours is a very</v>

1452
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:06.360
<v Speaker 1>bizarre situation because you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being on these pills from the time</v>

1453
01:08:06.361 --> 01:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you're 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1454
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really unique.</v>

1455
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 1>But then having almost a decade off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1456
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 1>seven years off of them is.</v>

1457
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1459
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:17.290
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1460
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.770
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it helps me help people.</v>

1461
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Like it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had lots of training as a life</v>

1462
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 4>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my own life experiences have been</v>

1463
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's really given me the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most creative.</v>

1464
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say,</v>

1465
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:34.980
<v Speaker 3>what are your credentials are that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually happy.</v>

1466
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually happy I,</v>

1467
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1468
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:42.880
<v Speaker 4>I've been able to create a life and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>career and friendships and connection</v>

1469
01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:43.900
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1470
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.870
<v Speaker 4>I thought I no longer live that story of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the I hate Christine Club.</v>

1471
01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I have great friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great women friends,</v>

1472
01:08:48.401 --> 01:08:49.720
<v Speaker 4>like all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1473
01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:50.610
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1474
01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like different or more special than</v>

1475
01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.360
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just again,</v>

1476
01:08:55.390 --> 01:09:00.390
<v Speaker 4>choices and I made choices that led me</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this point and everybody has that.</v>

1477
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has that freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the book?</v>

1478
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Man's search for meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever read that book by Viktor</v>

1479
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.091
<v Speaker 4>Frankl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1480
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:13.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was in concentration camps and he was</v>

1481
01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:14.650
<v Speaker 4>actually a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1482
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.570
<v Speaker 4>but he talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:20.740
<v Speaker 4>he kept himself saying and he kept</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself free through his mind and he</v>

1484
01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:25.720
<v Speaker 4>says in between stimulus and response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically what happens and how we</v>

1485
01:09:25.721 --> 01:09:28.510
<v Speaker 4>respond is a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that choice lies our ultimate</v>

1486
01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:31.090
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's true.</v>

1487
01:09:31.091 --> 01:09:33.010
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we all have.</v>

1488
01:09:33.011 --> 01:09:35.530
<v Speaker 4>That freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what your circumstances.</v>

1489
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.270
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone comes to you and they're</v>

1490
01:09:37.271 --> 01:09:37.851
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christina,</v>

1491
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get my shit together.</v>

1492
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

1493
01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you start with somebody?</v>

1494
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 3>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1495
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.650
<v Speaker 3>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is there anything that people are</v>

1496
01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:53.320
<v Speaker 3>universally could benefit from Missouri?</v>

1497
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1498
01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.680
<v Speaker 4>The number one thing that where I start</v>
<v Speaker 4>with people is having them really look</v>

1499
01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:05.520
<v Speaker 4>at their relationship with themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when they come they're like,</v>

1500
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:06.241
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucked up,</v>

1501
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:09.090
<v Speaker 4>or I need help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're relating to themselves as if</v>

1502
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.010
<v Speaker 4>something's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's wrong with them and they're</v>

1503
01:10:11.011 --> 01:10:14.160
<v Speaker 4>being really hard on themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've kind of lost hope and lost</v>

1504
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:18.250
<v Speaker 4>belief in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing is just like</v>

1505
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.780
<v Speaker 4>acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accepting where you are because you</v>

1506
01:10:21.781 --> 01:10:22.390
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

1507
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I haven't liked everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to me,</v>

1508
01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:27.780
<v Speaker 4>but one of the main raise I've been able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move through it is because I stopped</v>

1509
01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:29.700
<v Speaker 4>fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that like in martial arts,</v>

1510
01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:31.830
<v Speaker 4>if a punch comes at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to resist it.</v>

1511
01:10:31.831 --> 01:10:33.570
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to kind of move with it.</v>

1512
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Move away from it or roll with it,</v>

1513
01:10:35.521 --> 01:10:36.210
<v Speaker 3>roll with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1514
01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:39.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's like your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your teeth and taking on a job.</v>

1515
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1516
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.240
<v Speaker 4>And in life we kind of do that where</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1517
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.170
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this break up,</v>

1518
01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:44.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this layoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We resist it,</v>

1519
01:10:44.551 --> 01:10:46.260
<v Speaker 4>we fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>

1520
01:10:46.261 --> 01:10:48.480
<v Speaker 4>can we just get to acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing?</v>

1521
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Where are you are who you are and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening right now?</v>

1522
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Perspective and perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:56.670
<v Speaker 4>And when you can get to that neutral</v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

1524
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.850
<v Speaker 4>that's when you can start doing the work</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's when you can start doing</v>

1525
01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.460
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the second thing is I ask</v>

1526
01:11:02.461 --> 01:11:04.740
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe you can shift?</v>

1527
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that you have the power</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make different choices and change and</v>

1528
01:11:09.301 --> 01:11:11.790
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to know how that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my job.</v>

1529
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 4>I'll help you with the how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you've got to believe you can</v>

1530
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.470
<v Speaker 4>because if we don't believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible for us.</v>

1531
01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's really hard to make any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>change in our life.</v>

1532
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1533
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>that is giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how does someone believe,</v>

1534
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>like how do you get someone to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can make change?</v>

1535
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Like do they have to see evidence in</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>

1536
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there like do you recommend like</v>

1537
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>attempting things or tasks or hobbies</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

1538
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times it's going back to a time</v>

1539
01:11:45.011 --> 01:11:49.390
<v Speaker 4>in your life where you did take a chance</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you did do something that was a</v>

1540
01:11:49.391 --> 01:11:52.120
<v Speaker 4>stretch in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody has times in their life</v>

1541
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.780
<v Speaker 4>where they've done something they</v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't completely sure they could do</v>

1542
01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:00.700
<v Speaker 4>even if it's just a little thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has that reference point they</v>

1543
01:12:00.701 --> 01:12:02.770
<v Speaker 4>can go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of this joe,</v>

1544
01:12:02.771 --> 01:12:07.771
<v Speaker 4>like honestly a lot of it is taking a</v>
<v Speaker 4>leap of faith and I,</v>

1545
01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:12.370
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a lot of those and I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to know the answer and I've</v>

1546
01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:16.150
<v Speaker 4>wanted to know like 100 percent that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be guaranteed.</v>

1547
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Like if I take this leap of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything will work out and they</v>

1548
01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:21.430
<v Speaker 4>haven't always been 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantees,</v>

1549
01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.300
<v Speaker 4>but it was in taking that leap and</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking that chance and having little</v>

1550
01:12:25.301 --> 01:12:30.100
<v Speaker 4>faith that things started showing up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things started shifting and that's what</v>

1551
01:12:30.101 --> 01:12:33.880
<v Speaker 4>started to create the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a tricky thing because I think</v>

1552
01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:36.460
<v Speaker 4>people want evidence before they make</v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1553
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:40.990
<v Speaker 4>But you have to start making these</v>
<v Speaker 4>little changes to start having the</v>

1554
01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:43.660
<v Speaker 4>evidence show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I answered your</v>

1555
01:12:43.661 --> 01:12:44.140
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

1556
01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does make sense.</v>

1557
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1558
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I've often said that very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>

1559
01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's difficult that you do,</v>

1560
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it gives you the confidence that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome adversity.</v>

1561
01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1562
01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's I'm a martial art thing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines or marathon</v>

1563
01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>running or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do something like that,</v>

1564
01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:09.050
<v Speaker 1>these incremental changes happen where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push yourself through things and</v>

1565
01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you can achieve a goal,</v>

1566
01:13:10.781 --> 01:13:13.130
<v Speaker 1>if you could set out to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you achieve that goal.</v>

1567
01:13:13.131 --> 01:13:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run a marathon by the end</v>

1568
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I keep saying marathon,</v>

1569
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing things along those lines.</v>

1570
01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>They can be motivating factors that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help push you.</v>

1571
01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>They can be the engine that starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>push things in a positive direction.</v>

1572
01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Can you start to believe in yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to believe,</v>

1573
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1574
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.310
<v Speaker 4>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can take this step.</v>

1575
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often tell people that show up or come</v>

1576
01:13:37.071 --> 01:13:40.220
<v Speaker 4>to workshop where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just that fact that you're here is proof</v>

1577
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:43.910
<v Speaker 4>that you believe you can change because</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you wouldn't have shown up if some</v>

1578
01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:46.510
<v Speaker 4>part of you was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1579
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.380
<v Speaker 4>kind of certain that you could</v>

1580
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had someone come to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1581
01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I can't even help this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl.</v>

1582
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1583
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you get mostly dudes or girls?</v>

1584
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only coach a few people now.</v>

1585
01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my retreats are mostly women.</v>

1586
01:14:00.161 --> 01:14:04.030
<v Speaker 4>My private clients both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like courses and stuff.</v>

1587
01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>How can we have retreats that are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>

1588
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1589
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do one that will be both</v>

1590
01:14:10.911 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 4>men and women soon and it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>recipe for danger.</v>

1591
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 4>Too much depressed people hump it in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>woods or wherever we go.</v>

1592
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 4>The first one that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>

1593
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:23.221
<v Speaker 4>Some people come just to grow and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the woods</v>

1594
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 4>or out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1595
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to do it in places like Bali and</v>

1596
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Costa Rica jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>

1597
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Speaker 4>I finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people at this,</v>

1598
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 4>this might be able to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

1599
01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:48.190
<v Speaker 4>whenever I go to anywhere tropical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get eaten alive,</v>

1600
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 4>like eaten alive no matter what other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have three bites,</v>

1601
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I'll have 400.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I finally figured out B one,</v>

1602
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 4>vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1603
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally stopped.</v>

1604
01:14:57.161 --> 01:15:01.480
<v Speaker 4>It really have to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't take a b complex.</v>

1605
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:03.490
<v Speaker 4>It's vitamin B One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1606
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.040
<v Speaker 4>And it's for some reason stops in</v>
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes and bug bites.</v>

1607
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why why B One?</v>

1608
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know it works for me.</v>

1609
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Does something to change your smell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1610
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 4>It just worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was my salvation.</v>

1611
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:20.830
<v Speaker 4>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't bite you at all I little bit,</v>

1612
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 4>but again it went from being eaten alive</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just getting a few.</v>

1613
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever try thermacell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1614
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:27.350
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

1615
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Thermo cell is a device that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take when they go camping.</v>

1616
01:15:31.741 --> 01:15:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1617
01:15:33.091 --> 01:15:35.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

1618
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.480
<v Speaker 1>it looks like almost like a radio and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has these little pads and these slide</v>

1619
01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:44.481
<v Speaker 1>these pads into this heating element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this very fine mist comes out of</v>

1620
01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 1>this heating element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it on the ground near you</v>

1621
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and the bugs won't come with an 18 foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle.</v>

1622
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1623
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.900
<v Speaker 1>They use it when you're hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the woods because if you're,</v>

1624
01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1625
01:15:56.071 --> 01:16:00.960
<v Speaker 1>especially in Alaska or Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever been Alaska</v>

1626
01:16:00.961 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 1>in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mosquitoes are insane because they</v>

1627
01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:07.260
<v Speaker 1>own their only alive for a month.</v>

1628
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that is good at town,</v>

1629
01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.880
<v Speaker 4>like rabid Barbara,</v>

1630
01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Berrien mosquitoes like me and my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ari went fishing in Alaska and it was so</v>

1631
01:16:15.961 --> 01:16:18.720
<v Speaker 1>crazy that you would get out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up to this,</v>

1632
01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stream.</v>

1633
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.130
<v Speaker 1>You get out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open the door and then won't,</v>

1634
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you're hit with a cloud of mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We jumped back in the car and shut the</v>

1635
01:16:27.271 --> 01:16:30.120
<v Speaker 1>door and we were in the car with like 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes were like,</v>

1636
01:16:30.121 --> 01:16:33.690
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we're spraying ourselves all the</v>

1637
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.000
<v Speaker 1>spray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these toxic chemicals.</v>

1638
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Hell Dad found out about thermo sells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thermo cells just cleans it out.</v>

1639
01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Totally easy to travel with their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:44.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really light.</v>

1641
01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:46.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean barely smells,</v>

1642
01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but bugs don't want to have anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with it.</v>

1643
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Mosquitoes don't want to have anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with it without thermo cells like</v>

1644
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:55.140
<v Speaker 1>hanging out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sitting in a spot.</v>

1645
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.100
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unbearable unless you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquito netting and you don't want to</v>

1646
01:16:59.101 --> 01:17:02.490
<v Speaker 1>wear like all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mosquito bug spray stuff where your</v>

1647
01:17:02.491 --> 01:17:05.130
<v Speaker 1>skin is in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know all that stuff that you're</v>

1648
01:17:05.131 --> 01:17:07.620
<v Speaker 1>putting on your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just not good.</v>

1649
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was deet my first couple</v>

1650
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 3>of days on my last trip and I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting sick and I'm like,</v>

1651
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

1652
01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're processing and with your liver,</v>

1653
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 3>from your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets in your bloodstream.</v>

1654
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:19.211
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure there's probably some</v>
<v Speaker 3>nontoxic alternatives,</v>

1656
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:25.790
<v Speaker 3>but they probably don't work there now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it worked for me.</v>

1657
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b one,</v>

1658
01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that before.</v>

1659
01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:31.970
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine was telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Africa.</v>

1660
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 3>They went to Africa and they took a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of b vitamins.</v>

1661
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 3>The B one in particular did it for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>find anything on that journey.</v>

1662
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I found something that said that studies</v>
<v Speaker 3>are inconclusive,</v>

1663
01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Speaker 3>but it may make mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1664
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Stink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1665
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1666
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 3>It's fine for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's like a vitamin that</v>

1667
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:55.590
<v Speaker 3>makes people think you smell good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are mosquitoes people.</v>

1668
01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if bananas don't Eat Bananas for</v>

1669
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot Susan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat bananas.</v>

1670
01:17:59.881 --> 01:18:02.410
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would think that like,</v>

1671
01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.550
<v Speaker 1>like this probably like weird smells</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not even sure you detect you</v>

1672
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:09.370
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just give off a weird odor</v>

1673
01:18:09.371 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1674
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean not even like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not older,</v>

1675
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:16.120
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they just feel weird,</v>

1676
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that.</v>

1677
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan,</v>

1678
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.910
<v Speaker 1>my friend who's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1679
01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.280
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an author,</v>

1680
01:18:24.281 --> 01:18:27.460
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a sex at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's great,</v>

1681
01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 1>super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super smart guy.</v>

1682
01:18:29.381 --> 01:18:34.381
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me that there's certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>odors that human beings have and those</v>

1683
01:18:35.861 --> 01:18:39.430
<v Speaker 1>odors enable people to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're genetically</v>

1684
01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.840
<v Speaker 1>compatible with each other and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they used to be when we were kids.</v>

1685
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I used to always hear about couples</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking blood tests to make sure that</v>

1686
01:18:48.251 --> 01:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>they could have babies together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.330
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing.</v>

1688
01:18:52.331 --> 01:18:53.830
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would make sure that they were</v>

1689
01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:55.550
<v Speaker 1>compatible and I don't even know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>

1690
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It was real science behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would take blood tests to find</v>

1691
01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>out they were compatible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

1692
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being like really common</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss.</v>

1693
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was this is a the eighties or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nineties or whatever the fuck.</v>

1694
01:19:09.071 --> 01:19:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It was the dark ages of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it was that easy.</v>

1695
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not compatible.</v>

1696
01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Obviously personality wise and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that come into play.</v>

1697
01:19:17.291 --> 01:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>But they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1698
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan was saying that women can</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell a man's clothes,</v>

1699
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.710
<v Speaker 1>like you could smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally smell their clothes and they</v>

1700
01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:34.330
<v Speaker 1>would know whether or not they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that person based on the</v>

1701
01:19:34.331 --> 01:19:37.180
<v Speaker 1>smell that per person is getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Not like,</v>

1702
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy stinks,</v>

1703
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but like literally like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body knows what's repulsive and</v>

1704
01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:45.640
<v Speaker 1>what's not repulsive in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>

1705
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.610
<v Speaker 1>based on someone's odor that they give</v>
<v Speaker 1>off on their clothes,</v>

1706
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but what it didn't work is when they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>women on the pill,</v>

1707
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:56.380
<v Speaker 1>so when they put women on the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were no longer able to</v>

1708
01:19:56.381 --> 01:20:00.070
<v Speaker 1>differentiate whether or not someone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically compatible by smelling them</v>

1709
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.840
<v Speaker 1>that it gave you.</v>

1710
01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It fogged up your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your natural senses because I think when</v>

1711
01:20:06.731 --> 01:20:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you're on pill you don't actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>ovulate.</v>

1712
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not in the natural rhythm of</v>

1713
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.150
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a natural feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have when they're around a guy</v>

1715
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:21.460
<v Speaker 1>that they would breed with or a guy they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't breed with like,</v>

1716
01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotTa go,</v>

1717
01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1718
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And that is probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that are on the pill</v>

1719
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:30.430
<v Speaker 1>might be making like really shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic choices,</v>

1720
01:20:30.431 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 1>like literally genetic choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1721
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you can blame your last bad ex boyfriend</v>
<v Speaker 1>on being on the pill.</v>

1722
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>You could smell them accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think you can.</v>

1723
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it totally makes sense.</v>

1724
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris has probably listening right now</v>

1725
01:20:42.931 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>go and you fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably did,</v>

1726
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's probably something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to instinctual reactions to people.</v>

1727
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever met someone who,</v>

1728
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to be around this</v>

1729
01:20:56.521 --> 01:21:00.810
<v Speaker 1>person and then you find out years later</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that person is fucking crazy or</v>

1730
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:01.644
<v Speaker 1>this or that.</v>

1731
01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people give off in detectable in</v>

1732
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.980
<v Speaker 1>terms of like what we classify as</v>
<v Speaker 1>smells,</v>

1733
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 1>but maybe these pheromones have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a weird reaction to your birth</v>

1734
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:14.040
<v Speaker 1>control pills affects women's taste in</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1735
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1736
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:19.350
<v Speaker 1>How synthetic hormones changed desires</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women and their choice of a mate</v>

1737
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1738
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:23.250
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

1739
01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Well it just makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1741
01:21:26.691 --> 01:21:29.190
<v Speaker 1>it just can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nor your body must be so confused.</v>

1742
01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Like this pitch is pregnant all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1743
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it thinks.</v>

1744
01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Your body thinks you're pregnant all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time now.</v>

1745
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the pill scares me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just synthetic hormones pumping through</v>

1746
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.180
<v Speaker 1>your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Camp can't be all that good to never get</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1748
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of women never get off it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there on it forever.</v>

1749
01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes my hair oily when I'm off at.</v>

1751
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's stuff like that.</v>

1752
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.440
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways to balance your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

1753
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a hormone specialist,</v>

1754
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but why does hormones make a girl's hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>oily?</v>

1755
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1756
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>How do we get on the subject?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells.</v>

1757
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't take dudes.</v>

1758
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Dudes on retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I would think they're like getting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that are trying to get</v>

1760
01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 1>their life together and then having them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all together.</v>

1761
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you run into these weird issues?</v>

1762
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Were</v>

1763
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.080
<v Speaker 2>anything that really just trying to hook</v>
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>

1764
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1765
01:22:20.891 --> 01:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>You can get really distracted and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get,</v>

1766
01:22:22.781 --> 01:22:27.070
<v Speaker 2>like if there's some kind of attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can forget what you're there for and</v>

1767
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.610
<v Speaker 2>get obsessed with someone and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can kind of throw off the thing</v>

1768
01:22:30.611 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 2>and there's something too about,</v>

1769
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women coming together with women and men</v>

1770
01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:38.130
<v Speaker 2>coming together with men that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1771
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think kind of back to that tribal</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation we need,</v>

1772
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of women including myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have beef with other women,</v>

1773
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't like being around just a</v>

1774
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:50.380
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's competition that comes up</v>

1775
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.150
<v Speaker 2>and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I used to because I was scared of</v>

1776
01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 2>other women because I had all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1777
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1778
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 2>and so when you get a group of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1779
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times there is that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison and judgment and I can't</v>

1780
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:05.970
<v Speaker 2>trust into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's important for women,</v>

1781
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I think to gather together and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>do work separately from when there's men</v>

1782
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 2>there because there's something that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very healing just in that.</v>

1783
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1784
01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a level of vulnerability that's</v>

1785
01:23:18.311 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 2>possible when there aren't men.</v>

1786
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not to say that you can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable with men there,</v>

1787
01:23:23.771 --> 01:23:26.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a different dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same goes for men,</v>

1788
01:23:26.211 --> 01:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>like I know men who do men's groups and</v>
<v Speaker 2>men's work and there's great value in</v>

1789
01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>that and that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the problems I see a</v>

1790
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:39.490
<v Speaker 2>lot in intimate relationships is that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heterosexual relationship is that you</v>

1791
01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>expect this one person to be your</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and you're not.</v>

1792
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.310
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a tribe and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a community,</v>

1793
01:23:45.311 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 2>you don't have friends of the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex in the same sex that are fulfilling</v>

1794
01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:52.150
<v Speaker 2>kind of these needs that we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just project like this.</v>

1795
01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.690
<v Speaker 2>My one person has to be my everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my soul mate.</v>

1796
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1797
01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 2>having your community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be,</v>

1798
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:00.610
<v Speaker 2>and having different friends I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

1799
01:24:00.611 --> 01:24:02.710
<v Speaker 2>super important to having a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1800
01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having friends period is super</v>

1801
01:24:04.981 --> 01:24:06.720
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something that I tweeted today</v>

1802
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that I was reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1803
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:14.180
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about the role that</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and family have in creating a</v>

1804
01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:19.221
<v Speaker 1>personality and how much of an impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>your peers have and they think that your</v>

1805
01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:24.471
<v Speaker 1>peers and the friends you choose have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger impact than anything in your</v>

1806
01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:27.540
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really fascinating.</v>

1807
01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted this morning on it,</v>

1808
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those articles where you</v>

1809
01:24:32.221 --> 01:24:33.630
<v Speaker 1>read it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1810
01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:38.250
<v Speaker 1>that completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Researcher argues that peers are much</v>

1811
01:24:38.251 --> 01:24:41.790
<v Speaker 1>more important than parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that psychologists underestimate the</v>

1812
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:45.840
<v Speaker 1>power of genetics and that we have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn from Asian classrooms.</v>

1813
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1814
01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.020
<v Speaker 1>What about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Asian classrooms to go down</v>

1815
01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and scroll?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgot what that was about.</v>

1816
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably too long of an article to</v>

1817
01:24:55.231 --> 01:24:56.950
<v Speaker 1>really get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1818
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.903
<v Speaker 1>would have to read it.</v>

1819
01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But peers in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm choosing likeminded folks</v>

1820
01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:05.850
<v Speaker 1>and choosing people that are on a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

1821
01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1822
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it helps support you and it supports</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you feed off of each other.</v>

1823
01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And when the tribe does well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do well.</v>

1824
01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very,</v>

1825
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>very critical and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to be the person that's</v>

1826
01:25:18.091 --> 01:25:21.360
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be the one that's out</v>

1827
01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:23.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get knit and fuck the world's all</v>

1828
01:25:23.431 --> 01:25:25.500
<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do that,</v>

1829
01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.150
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

1830
01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna mess up the whole happiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1831
01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Like the happiness thing comes with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you're around having a</v>

1832
01:25:33.751 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>

1833
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:25:36.041 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And then it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's endless.</v>

1835
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep upping the ante.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what we want more than</v>

1836
01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:47.110
<v Speaker 2>anything is connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connection.</v>

1837
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:51.170
<v Speaker 2>We want love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to feel like we belong to.</v>

1838
01:25:51.171 --> 01:25:53.440
<v Speaker 2>So I think belonging is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

1839
01:25:53.441 --> 01:25:57.430
<v Speaker 2>huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think as adults we think we belong</v>

1840
01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>achieving things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really it's finding those people</v>

1842
01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>that you can just be yourself</v>

1843
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 4>with and to have that tribe and also let</v>
<v Speaker 4>go of the people that are bringing you</v>

1844
01:26:07.911 --> 01:26:11.210
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've outgrown some people in my</v>

1845
01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 4>life and some friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that I'm better than,</v>

1846
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just on like a different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different path and a different route and</v>

1847
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:20.510
<v Speaker 4>it's important I think to kind of know</v>
<v Speaker 4>like who's the sort of dead weight and</v>

1848
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 4>your life and what are some friendships</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might have reached their expiration</v>

1849
01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:25.740
<v Speaker 4>date that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1850
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been great,</v>

1851
01:26:27.591 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1852
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.360
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of those friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not helping them either.</v>

1853
01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>

1854
01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:35.680
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when someone cuts you loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1855
01:26:35.681 --> 01:26:36.910
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

1856
01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.710
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to look at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1857
01:26:38.711 --> 01:26:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes when you enable a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

1858
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing yourself any good,</v>

1859
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing them any good either.</v>

1860
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a big Aha for me when my fiance</v>

1861
01:26:51.301 --> 01:26:54.840
<v Speaker 4>broke up with me because I very much</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to be the victim in that,</v>

1862
01:26:54.841 --> 01:26:56.520
<v Speaker 4>but I had to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

1863
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.250
<v Speaker 4>what did I like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did I do?</v>

1864
01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.061
<v Speaker 4>Because everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1865
01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:03.630
<v Speaker 4>he's such a jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I really had to look at how was I</v>

1866
01:27:03.631 --> 01:27:08.631
<v Speaker 4>showing up in that relationship that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>impacting his decision because he wasn't</v>

1867
01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:11.490
<v Speaker 4>a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he wasn't just a jerk who decided,</v>

1868
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to break up with this girl.</v>

1869
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Like there were ways I was showing up</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were like made him make the</v>

1870
01:27:17.911 --> 01:27:20.550
<v Speaker 4>decision that he makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think in any of those situations,</v>

1871
01:27:20.551 --> 01:27:22.500
<v Speaker 4>friendship or relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1872
01:27:22.501 --> 01:27:23.760
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to go too far.</v>

1873
01:27:23.761 --> 01:27:25.230
<v Speaker 4>The other extreme and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

1874
01:27:25.231 --> 01:27:27.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm a loser and think it's all your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>

1875
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:30.000
<v Speaker 4>But it's important to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>

1876
01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:31.320
<v Speaker 4>what's my part in this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1877
01:27:31.321 --> 01:27:35.370
<v Speaker 4>what's my responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I played a role in this whole</v>

1878
01:27:35.371 --> 01:27:36.204
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1879
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no one way street when it</v>

1880
01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:42.360
<v Speaker 1>comes to relationship and if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with a bad person,</v>

1881
01:27:42.361 --> 01:27:45.180
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you get in that in the first</v>

1882
01:27:45.181 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1883
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:49.210
<v Speaker 1>if they did trick you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1884
01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:50.850
<v Speaker 1>what did you do when you realized it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trick?</v>

1885
01:27:50.851 --> 01:27:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you stick around and try to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.710
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a really good question</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean how many people do you</v>

1887
01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:59.920
<v Speaker 4>know that are in bad relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Continue talking about it but don't,</v>

1888
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.590
<v Speaker 4>aren't doing anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're brutal.</v>

1889
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 4>They're not leaving it and if people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>brutal are because there's just like</v>

1890
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:11.830
<v Speaker 4>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times it's because it's</v>

1891
01:28:11.831 --> 01:28:15.940
<v Speaker 4>familiar and it's date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What there's somebody said,</v>

1892
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get the love you think you deserve</v>

1893
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.660
<v Speaker 4>and it may be easy for us looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside going,</v>

1894
01:28:22.661 --> 01:28:23.590
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy.</v>

1895
01:28:23.591 --> 01:28:25.240
<v Speaker 4>You should just like leave this</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

1896
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.790
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times the person like</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't think they can do better.</v>

1897
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe this is like playing out some</v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamic they had with their parent or</v>

1898
01:28:31.601 --> 01:28:33.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sort of need to understand why</v>

1899
01:28:33.971 --> 01:28:37.270
<v Speaker 4>you're in it before you can actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>make the choice to get out of it.</v>

1900
01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:39.130
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of delusional people out</v>

1901
01:28:39.131 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 1>there that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deserve a lot more than I'm getting.</v>

1902
01:28:41.951 --> 01:28:43.990
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really there.</v>

1903
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.970
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when someone comes to you</v>

1904
01:28:45.971 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 1>with unrealistic expectations or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to see themselves like you</v>

1905
01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:50.770
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>

1906
01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you'd tell them what they need to do or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they should consider and they argue</v>

1907
01:28:54.941 --> 01:28:55.774
<v Speaker 1>with you about it.</v>

1908
01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really ask like,</v>

1909
01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 4>is what you're doing working like is</v>
<v Speaker 4>your way working?</v>

1910
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.150
<v Speaker 4>You can show me your ways working then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1911
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:07.570
<v Speaker 1>My weight is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking other people.</v>

1912
01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is all messed up.</v>

1913
01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

1914
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to coach everyone else.</v>

1915
01:29:15.821 --> 01:29:16.654
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1916
01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we could just change other people.</v>

1917
01:29:19.391 --> 01:29:21.640
<v Speaker 4>It's everybody else's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1918
01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have to tell people you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to work with them?</v>

1919
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I've had one person I had to tell that</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1920
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one and it was,</v>

1921
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

1922
01:29:32.471 --> 01:29:35.860
<v Speaker 4>it was just not a good fit and she just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't ready.</v>

1923
01:29:35.861 --> 01:29:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Willing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The super committed to her story and</v>

1924
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.420
<v Speaker 4>sort of wanted me just to cuddle it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I wasn't willing to do.</v>

1925
01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people just want someone to</v>

1926
01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:46.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've always wondered about</v>

1927
01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have friends that have been to</v>

1928
01:29:47.861 --> 01:29:48.461
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1929
01:29:48.461 --> 01:29:49.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do when you go there?</v>

1930
01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You talk about your problems and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens while they give you advice and</v>

1931
01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do shit.</v>

1932
01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people that just</v>

1933
01:29:56.861 --> 01:30:00.130
<v Speaker 1>want to go somewhere and once a month to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to them talk.</v>

1934
01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1935
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.000
<v Speaker 1>They'll go three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times a week and they're still</v>

1936
01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:05.380
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1937
01:30:05.381 --> 01:30:06.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't working.</v>

1938
01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1939
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:11.180
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think my intention always is to</v>

1940
01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 4>really give people the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just advice and really help them</v>

1941
01:30:14.751 --> 01:30:16.760
<v Speaker 4>heal really get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had amazing teachers have been</v>

1942
01:30:16.761 --> 01:30:20.060
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really lucky and they've really taught.</v>

1943
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:23.330
<v Speaker 4>They haven't just given me advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't just given me motivation.</v>

1944
01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:28.780
<v Speaker 4>They've really given me tools to heal</v>
<v Speaker 4>and change and that's,</v>

1945
01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 4>that's what I try to do in my work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people is show them that it that a as</v>

1946
01:30:34.791 --> 01:30:39.170
<v Speaker 4>possible and they can do it and give</v>
<v Speaker 4>them the tools to do it because that's</v>

1947
01:30:39.171 --> 01:30:41.430
<v Speaker 4>what that's going to last longer than</v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of like</v>

1948
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.940
<v Speaker 1>pep talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny.</v>

1949
01:30:42.941 --> 01:30:46.330
<v Speaker 1>We were talking before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>started about going to a seminar and</v>

1950
01:30:46.331 --> 01:30:50.290
<v Speaker 1>someone asking how many men here feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable?</v>

1951
01:30:51.190 --> 01:30:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And like no one's putting their hand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many women here feel vulnerable?</v>

1952
01:30:55.690 --> 01:30:59.230
<v Speaker 1>All the hands went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the hands went up and I mean,</v>

1953
01:30:59.231 --> 01:31:02.020
<v Speaker 1>part of it I think is a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusional because I think a lot of men</v>

1954
01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:04.060
<v Speaker 1>are way more vulnerable than they really</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they are.</v>

1955
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:08.580
<v Speaker 1>But also there's just a different thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through live.</v>

1956
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fairer sex or.</v>

1957
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>But being a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a woman means you are physically</v>

1958
01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:16.834
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1959
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Your roundup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people that most of them</v>

1960
01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.520
<v Speaker 1>could beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1961
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1962
01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a different way to walk through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1963
01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:31.201
<v Speaker 1>That vulnerability though is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates another level of anxiety,</v>

1964
01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like walking down a dark street,</v>

1965
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you see someone and it's a man and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking down a dark street to like,</v>

1966
01:31:39.281 --> 01:31:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1967
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:41.241
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1968
01:31:41.241 --> 01:31:44.900
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's scary and it's something that,</v>

1969
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1970
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:48.740
<v Speaker 4>as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm always aware of it.</v>

1971
01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Not always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of the time,</v>

1972
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:51.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>

1973
01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

1974
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I could get beaten up like it's between</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and a man.</v>

1975
01:31:57.951 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 4>He's probably gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm pretty strong but</v>

1976
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 2>not that strong and I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's also beautiful about</v>

1977
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 2>women and just the feminine general is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that vulnerability.</v>

1978
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 2>But because like at sometimes as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels safe,</v>

1979
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why a lot of women like</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of have a protective armor and are</v>

1980
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>guarded and sometimes more and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like masculine energy in the world is</v>

1981
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:19.300
<v Speaker 2>because on some level we feel like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>

1982
01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>we have to like protect ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas that,</v>

1983
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:27.880
<v Speaker 2>that vulnerability really is the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes us women in so many ways not.</v>

1984
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think we confuse vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 2>with weakness because vulnerability to</v>

1985
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>me is being open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being available,</v>

1986
01:32:36.731 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 2>being um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft but not weak.</v>

1987
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Weakness to me is more about kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into the victimy and going into</v>

1988
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that poor pitiful me and the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for and on all of those kinds of</v>

1989
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's beautiful power and</v>

1990
01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:53.920
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we're talking about just</v>

1991
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:55.990
<v Speaker 2>physical strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1992
01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:59.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men have the advantage on that one.</v>

1993
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:04.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just we need all the pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1994
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:08.800
<v Speaker 1>You need the whole spectrum of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and it.</v>

1995
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in terms of,</v>

1996
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional way of looking at</v>

1997
01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:14.531
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1998
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:17.980
<v Speaker 1>masculine men are attracted to feminine</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and Feminine.</v>

1999
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Women are attracted to masculine men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both need each other,</v>

2000
01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with</v>

2001
01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:29.590
<v Speaker 1>damaged folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a man who has a</v>

2002
01:33:29.591 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable woman in the man's all fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2003
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 1>so he takes it out on the vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and the vulnerable woman is like</v>

2004
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2005
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pressure of the relationship or the</v>

2006
01:33:41.531 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 1>suppression of being connected to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2007
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and so you kind of dealing with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic that you were dealing with when</v>

2008
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you were in school or someone's bullying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you get it in this relationship.</v>

2009
01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Then instead of someone appreciating you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the difference in the softness</v>

2010
01:33:56.591 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 1>versus the of the Yin and the Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have someone who is exploiting</v>

2011
01:34:00.821 --> 01:34:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that and you see it with women too and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see it with like aggressive women</v>

2012
01:34:05.171 --> 01:34:07.240
<v Speaker 1>and weak men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2013
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:10.090
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the saddest things I ever see is</v>

2014
01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>when you find the aggressive women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weak man cut.</v>

2015
01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Probably because I'm terrified of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been me.</v>

2016
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will be,</v>

2017
01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2018
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants a woman who's yelling at</v>

2019
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you and andy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woohoo.</v>

2020
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.690
<v Speaker 2>That happens a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

2021
01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy to me because,</v>

2022
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see women emasculate men quite often,</v>

2023
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not maybe on like a huge scale to the</v>

2024
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:44.860
<v Speaker 2>degree you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like the little comments,</v>

2025
01:34:44.861 --> 01:34:48.400
<v Speaker 2>like I'll be out with a couple and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman will say something and it's,</v>

2026
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of emasculating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the roles were reversed and the guy</v>

2027
01:34:53.591 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>said something like that to the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it would go over,</v>

2028
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys just kinda take it</v>

2029
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 1>on sometimes and then when I see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2030
01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of men feel emasculated by society</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

2031
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:09.160
<v Speaker 1>just by the roles that they play in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>office and the,</v>

2032
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.033
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2033
01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:15.060
<v Speaker 1>the physical act of going through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this civilized world and also constantly</v>

2034
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:21.401
<v Speaker 1>needing people's affirmation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needing people's acceptance and,</v>

2035
01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of become what people want you</v>

2036
01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that's not what you want.</v>

2037
01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>You get in these relationships and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it all the time where a guy sort of</v>

2038
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 1>accept a little bit and then they accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and then they don't want to mess</v>

2039
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:38.420
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have a bunch of friends that</v>

2040
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:42.440
<v Speaker 1>have like really domineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overbearing wives or girlfriends.</v>

2041
01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to be around them.</v>

2042
01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:45.351
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2043
01:35:45.351 --> 01:35:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can leave.</v>

2044
01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just like,</v>

2045
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:48.650
<v Speaker 1>this is just a person.</v>

2046
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're scared.</v>

2047
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>They're scared and it becomes the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2048
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

2049
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.810
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go out of the fucking wife,</v>

2050
01:35:56.811 --> 01:35:58.400
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go home to the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:35:58.401 --> 01:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2052
01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange when you have someone</v>

2053
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.150
<v Speaker 1>in your life that's essentially like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parole officer,</v>

2054
01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 1>so many life that gets to tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and you're not allowed to do</v>

2055
01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:10.940
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to watch certain</v>

2056
01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:14.360
<v Speaker 1>things or certain things and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>control you and they own.</v>

2057
01:36:14.361 --> 01:36:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2058
01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing that,</v>

2059
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:21.980
<v Speaker 1>much like the girl who bullied you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2060
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 1>anybody who does that to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2061
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:27.230
<v Speaker 1>they do it out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of fear.</v>

2062
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:30.830
<v Speaker 1>They do that to insecurity and they also</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it out of this bizarre instinct</v>

2063
01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:31.730
<v Speaker 1>because they can.</v>

2064
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I state this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a bad person but she used to</v>

2065
01:36:35.691 --> 01:36:37.730
<v Speaker 1>like to fight and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

2066
01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I do not like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that kind of conflict.</v>

2067
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like interrelationship conflict.</v>

2068
01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

2069
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I won't fight and argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just rather leave.</v>

2070
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like all into I'm into discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2071
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:49.940
<v Speaker 1>but when people start yelling and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

2072
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

2073
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up around domestic violence too.</v>

2074
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I saw it when I was a kid.</v>

2075
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested and so we broke up,</v>

2076
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 1>but we stayed friends and then years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later we went out to coffee and like,</v>

2077
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 1>how's everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2078
01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm living with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going good.</v>

2079
01:37:11.421 --> 01:37:11.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2080
01:37:11.931 --> 01:37:14.780
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's telling me how she yells at this</v>

2081
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:16.490
<v Speaker 1>guy and she can't help it.</v>

2082
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help it.</v>

2083
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking yell at him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything.</v>

2084
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.230
<v Speaker 1>He just takes it and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes it.</v>

2085
01:37:24.231 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I just want to fucking smash him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2086
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2087
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to yell at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help doing it.</v>

2088
01:37:29.841 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And then when he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2089
01:37:31.131 --> 01:37:35.870
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had this weird,</v>

2090
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:40.160
<v Speaker 1>almost like a natural impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate this guy.</v>

2091
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Like if you ever seen two dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dog has the upper hand on the on the</v>

2092
01:37:44.211 --> 01:37:48.370
<v Speaker 1>dog and he'll go near the dog and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other dog and that's just,</v>

2093
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.870
<v Speaker 1>that's just their world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just their world.</v>

2094
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:54.830
<v Speaker 1>The other dog never gets a chance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's not even a size based</v>

2095
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:57.060
<v Speaker 1>thing or they might be the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 1>size dog,</v>

2096
01:37:57.061 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 1>just one dog just decides the bitch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one's the dominator and that's</v>

2097
01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:03.810
<v Speaker 1>just how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While she was in this position with this</v>

2098
01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:08.811
<v Speaker 1>guy where she just had this compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to fucking yell at them.</v>

2099
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.451
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2100
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:10.940
<v Speaker 1>what are you yelling at him for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2101
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2102
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.551
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2103
01:38:13.551 --> 01:38:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to tell me to shut the fuck</v>

2104
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:16.540
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2105
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted him to out manner.</v>

2106
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that crazy?</v>

2107
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what a bizarre instinct to like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push.</v>

2108
01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Like she was frustrated at herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was frustrated at him,</v>

2109
01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like she was compelled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's being drawn to the great</v>

2110
01:38:33.331 --> 01:38:34.690
<v Speaker 1>magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2111
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:35.663
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2112
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to scream at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2113
01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Well it's interesting like how we</v>
<v Speaker 4>project onto other people,</v>

2114
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:42.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever.</v>

2115
01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Some of that was going on inside of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like creating that dynamic in</v>

2116
01:38:46.391 --> 01:38:48.010
<v Speaker 4>him and then she could have left at any</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2117
01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:53.040
<v Speaker 4>It was like she was so trying to get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction out of him honestly to probably</v>

2118
01:38:53.111 --> 01:38:55.460
<v Speaker 4>see if he cared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she probably equated.</v>

2119
01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Alright well him taking it means he</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't care.</v>

2120
01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:00.310
<v Speaker 4>So how much can I push?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much can I push,</v>

2121
01:39:00.311 --> 01:39:02.510
<v Speaker 4>how can I match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I push so that I can see that he,</v>

2122
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.150
<v Speaker 4>he'll react enough because that means.</v>

2123
01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what it is that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't think he cares or do you think</v>

2124
01:39:06.801 --> 01:39:09.590
<v Speaker 1>she just thinks he's weak and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating to her that he's weak?</v>

2125
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:11.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was just that,</v>

2126
01:39:11.381 --> 01:39:12.880
<v Speaker 4>I think she would have left a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>

2127
01:39:12.881 --> 01:39:16.540
<v Speaker 4>There was something she wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we don't keep doing it over and</v>

2128
01:39:16.541 --> 01:39:19.720
<v Speaker 4>over and over again unless there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something more attached to getting.</v>

2129
01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:20.801
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2130
01:39:20.801 --> 01:39:22.480
<v Speaker 4>when we're just went and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

2131
01:39:22.481 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 4>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2132
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:26.350
<v Speaker 4>we get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when we find ourselves in situations</v>

2133
01:39:26.351 --> 01:39:29.770
<v Speaker 4>where it's like it's happening over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again and tend to get</v>

2134
01:39:29.771 --> 01:39:33.100
<v Speaker 4>frustrated but we're not leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something we're attached to</v>

2135
01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:37.300
<v Speaker 4>trying to get from our behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was something she wanted in</v>

2136
01:39:37.301 --> 01:39:38.810
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was something in it for her,</v>

2137
01:39:38.811 --> 01:39:40.210
<v Speaker 4>although I should have been out there a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot sooner.</v>

2138
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also she was trying to do the</v>

2139
01:39:42.861 --> 01:39:45.860
<v Speaker 1>acting thing and she was constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated.</v>

2140
01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.820
<v Speaker 1>She was constantly just taking it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

2141
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Well that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really interesting.</v>

2142
01:39:52.821 --> 01:39:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd watch these like almost sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic things.</v>

2143
01:39:55.790 --> 01:40:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Like there would be these moments where</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would be preparing for an audition</v>

2144
01:40:00.891 --> 01:40:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and she'd be hopeful yet nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of anxiety and there was</v>

2145
01:40:04.281 --> 01:40:06.950
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing and it's going to go</v>

2146
01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully if this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's connected to this and that's</v>

2147
01:40:09.981 --> 01:40:12.230
<v Speaker 1>going to happen with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

2148
01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:14.880
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this massive let down,</v>

2149
01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a cigarette smoking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and you know,</v>

2150
01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:23.420
<v Speaker 1>all this angst and I got the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2151
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:28.050
<v Speaker 1>But this dude got in there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he caught me,</v>

2152
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.940
<v Speaker 1>he caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2153
01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.880
<v Speaker 1>the second wave of angst when I met her.</v>

2154
01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:36.020
<v Speaker 1>She was just moving here and so she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't completely bewildered by the</v>

2155
01:40:36.021 --> 01:40:37.960
<v Speaker 1>experience in the machine yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2156
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for some people choosing things</v>

2157
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:47.240
<v Speaker 1>that you do for a living that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy for you,</v>

2158
01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that get</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in careers that require too</v>

2159
01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:54.580
<v Speaker 1>much of their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really want to do it,</v>

2160
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but you get caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's being a lawyer,</v>

2161
01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>being a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or being something that has a</v>

2162
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:02.220
<v Speaker 1>prestigious title when you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something great tech,</v>

2163
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but really in the back of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else that you probably</v>

2164
01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:07.590
<v Speaker 1>be way happier doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2165
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going after it for the wrong</v>

2166
01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do though?</v>

2167
01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't doing a life coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you enjoy doing what you're</v>

2168
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have like if somehow or another</v>

2169
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you were independently wealthy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to coach all these crazy</v>

2170
01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.274
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2171
01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Not that they're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of them will probably do it.</v>

2172
01:41:25.041 --> 01:41:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2173
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.991
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2174
01:41:28.991 --> 01:41:31.670
<v Speaker 4>I love people and I love personal</v>
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>

2175
01:41:31.671 --> 01:41:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Even if I had all the money in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

2176
01:41:33.441 --> 01:41:35.810
<v Speaker 4>I still speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd still do my podcasts.</v>

2177
01:41:35.811 --> 01:41:38.060
<v Speaker 4>I'd still do retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2178
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.600
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I love the human experience.</v>

2179
01:41:41.601 --> 01:41:45.860
<v Speaker 4>I love being there for that moment where</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone has a major insight where they</v>

2180
01:41:45.861 --> 01:41:50.090
<v Speaker 4>connect dots and it's like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a massive perspective shift and like all</v>

2181
01:41:50.091 --> 01:41:53.030
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden they start to kind of move a</v>
<v Speaker 4>different direction.</v>

2182
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:56.000
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine doing anything else.</v>

2183
01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I could sing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had any kind of music ability,</v>

2184
01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:00.950
<v Speaker 4>I think it'd be awesome to be a rock</v>
<v Speaker 4>star.</v>

2185
01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:05.951
<v Speaker 4>Like just to have that rush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but literally I have no musical ability</v>

2186
01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:09.410
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever other than listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just do not have it.</v>

2187
01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Well that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you found your thing now how often is</v>

2188
01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:14.350
<v Speaker 1>it when you talk to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're trying to coach them and</v>

2189
01:42:14.351 --> 01:42:16.360
<v Speaker 1>help them and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2190
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you got to do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that A.</v>

2191
01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:22.180
<v Speaker 1>is that a factor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I would think that see the thing</v>

2192
01:42:22.181 --> 01:42:25.030
<v Speaker 1>about careers is not only is it eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of your time,</v>

2193
01:42:25.031 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but it also kind of defines you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every day you're defined by whatever</v>

2194
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you do and oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about like men in</v>

2195
01:42:32.501 --> 01:42:35.140
<v Speaker 1>these workplace environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of like,</v>

2196
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.310
<v Speaker 1>they're boxed into this predetermined</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern or behavior that's expected from</v>

2197
01:42:39.311 --> 01:42:39.731
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2198
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:44.731
<v Speaker 1>they have shoes with tassels on them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ties and they have to talk business talk</v>

2199
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you fall into these weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and you lose a lot of your</v>

2200
01:42:49.811 --> 01:42:54.790
<v Speaker 1>individuality inside those patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>because office life and you know,</v>

2201
01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 1>human resources demand certain things of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2202
01:42:57.401 --> 01:43:02.401
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a certain your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're in an office</v>

2203
01:43:02.741 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're in the corporate world,</v>

2204
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 1>your personality is stuffed into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

2205
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that form is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that mold is,</v>

2206
01:43:13.751 --> 01:43:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the mold of being a business person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2207
01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you know you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a businesswoman.</v>

2208
01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:22.120
<v Speaker 1>You want to be respected and want to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right word to say the right things</v>

2209
01:43:22.121 --> 01:43:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2210
01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:28.190
<v Speaker 1>and talk the right lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the like a lot of times people are</v>

2211
01:43:28.571 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 1>left wondering who the fuck am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2212
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:31.580
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2213
01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.590
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just get totally lost in a role.</v>

2214
01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do like,</v>

2215
01:43:35.331 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 4>I go do a lot of corporate speaking and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of people come up to me</v>

2216
01:43:39.051 --> 01:43:41.510
<v Speaker 4>afterwards and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

2217
01:43:41.511 --> 01:43:43.310
<v Speaker 4>like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I talk about,</v>

2218
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we lose ourselves in these roles and</v>

2219
01:43:46.341 --> 01:43:51.341
<v Speaker 4>how like a lot of times our adult life</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes sort of just this like checklist</v>

2220
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 4>follow</v>

2221
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Truman show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one thing after the other just like</v>

2222
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:57.200
<v Speaker 2>follow this structure that was set out</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>

2223
01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 2>We never checked in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I want this?</v>

2224
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I even want this?</v>

2225
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:03.560
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to answer your question,</v>

2226
01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:06.110
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times when people come or I'm</v>

2227
01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:08.750
<v Speaker 2>working with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is like looking at like,</v>

2228
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:10.580
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this career right for you?</v>

2229
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Is this relationship right for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you created in your life</v>

2230
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:16.670
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't fit where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're in it because you're scared</v>

2231
01:44:16.671 --> 01:44:18.270
<v Speaker 2>to make the change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2232
01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.220
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2233
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.030
<v Speaker 2>some people really can be happy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate America,</v>

2234
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:23.900
<v Speaker 2>like some people</v>

2235
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.390
<v Speaker 1>she works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2236
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:30.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that the vast majority</v>

2237
01:44:30.351 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 1>of people that are living the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

2238
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 1>living that life during that nine to</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2239
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.710
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

2240
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Horrifically miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2242
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it's so defining and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so contrary to the human spirit.</v>

2243
01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2244
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.410
<v Speaker 1>But I think most people don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that.</v>

2245
01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to believe that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that everybody's doing</v>

2246
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2247
01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 2>And they don't believe they can change</v>
<v Speaker 2>it then.</v>

2248
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other option.</v>

2249
01:44:58.311 --> 01:45:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they have a mortgage and a</v>

2250
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:03.260
<v Speaker 2>spouse and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>student loans,</v>

2251
01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:04.550
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's really intimidating to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh,</v>

2253
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:08.810
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I change this?</v>

2254
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to start small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to start with,</v>

2255
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to quit my job tomorrow,</v>

2256
01:45:14.301 --> 01:45:18.260
<v Speaker 2>but what are some things in my life I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can start doing that made me feel alive</v>

2257
01:45:18.261 --> 01:45:19.100
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2258
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:21.800
<v Speaker 2>is it a hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it like training for a marathon?</v>

2259
01:45:21.801 --> 01:45:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it what is going to start making me</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>

2260
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm creative and I matter and I'm more</v>

2261
01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 2>than just this role as husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>

2262
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:30.680
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

2263
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.020
<v Speaker 2>corporate executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2264
01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a good place to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something small you can do to make</v>

2265
01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you feel alive again because anybody has</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to that,</v>

2266
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2267
01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to leave your job to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start creating some things in your life</v>

2268
01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 2>that can start to shift things and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about then it's</v>

2269
01:45:47.061 --> 01:45:48.770
<v Speaker 2>like the gradual change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2270
01:45:48.771 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people just to quit their job</v>

2271
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think it's possible.</v>

2272
01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost knowing exactly what and,</v>

2273
01:45:56.050 --> 01:45:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and not everybody's meant to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur either and do their own</v>

2274
01:45:58.791 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are always things we can do in</v>

2275
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 2>our life to mix it up a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just show up differently in our</v>

2276
01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:07.124
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2277
01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that for a huge amount of</v>

2278
01:46:10.981 --> 01:46:13.980
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of time that's required of</v>

2279
01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:14.700
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Because of their job is so overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people,</v>

2281
01:46:19.411 --> 01:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest or not really just</v>
<v Speaker 1>working nine to five,</v>

2282
01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:25.110
<v Speaker 1>particularly most men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of overtime</v>

2283
01:46:25.111 --> 01:46:25.944
<v Speaker 1>involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2284
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at some thing that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2285
01:46:28.261 --> 01:46:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It was an article on the wage gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in what would it really is</v>

2286
01:46:31.501 --> 01:46:33.720
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that was about was</v>

2287
01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the amount of the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of hours that men work and in</v>

2288
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:40.140
<v Speaker 1>their ambition to try to climb up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate ladder.</v>

2289
01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the numbers that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and it's terrifying.</v>

2290
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're working 60 hours a week,</v>

2291
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing left.</v>

2292
01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.870
<v Speaker 1>If I worked here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2293
01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a podcast or three hours and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a bunch of other stuff and you</v>

2294
01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fit in things in my day</v>

2295
01:46:57.901 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and I have a pretty loose schedule.</v>

2296
01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of things,</v>

2297
01:47:00.901 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2298
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 1>like today I did UFC stuff for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours this morning and then I come here</v>

2299
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:09.350
<v Speaker 1>for a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I got to work out.</v>

2300
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Then it will tell some jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of movement in there.</v>

2301
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of times where I can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit done.</v>

2302
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't have any of that.</v>

2303
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think was like that made</v>

2304
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like back in the day where you could</v>

2305
01:47:22.971 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 1>have done that path of the corporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>route?</v>

2306
01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Why did you make different choices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

2307
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

2308
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2309
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I never felt like I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never felt like I could have a regular</v>

2310
01:47:37.261 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 1>job like I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time I got out of high school,</v>

2311
01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I never had a full time job.</v>

2312
01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I had a bunch of part time jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some full time jobs,</v>

2313
01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 1>were construction companies and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't last.</v>

2314
01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I would do them for like a month or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and I was like,</v>

2315
01:47:51.361 --> 01:47:54.510
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is about.</v>

2316
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And it was all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the main source</v>

2317
01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 1>of all my problems in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my problems in high school is I was</v>

2318
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:07.050
<v Speaker 1>not willing to do things I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

2319
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.840
<v Speaker 1>so I would barely get by through high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2320
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I go take tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would register intelligence or</v>

2321
01:48:14.281 --> 01:48:15.510
<v Speaker 1>measure intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>

2322
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would take actual test based on</v>

2323
01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:22.440
<v Speaker 1>what I was supposed to be studying and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking barely paid attention.</v>

2324
01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean I squoze through high school with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a c average in most things.</v>

2325
01:48:28.081 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I barely got by and even when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to college I was only going to</v>

2326
01:48:32.161 --> 01:48:32.580
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

2327
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I went to Boston University and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>umass rather in Boston and the only</v>

2328
01:48:36.541 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 1>reason why I went is because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want anybody to think I was a loser.</v>

2329
01:48:40.650 --> 01:48:42.730
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking classes at Umass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2330
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:46.290
<v Speaker 1>It was and I was teaching taekwondo at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston University,</v>

2331
01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:51.291
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good school and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at all these people that were</v>

2332
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 1>preparing for life and to me it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2333
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:57.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go get eaten by</v>
<v Speaker 1>alligators or something.</v>

2334
01:48:57.021 --> 01:48:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

2335
01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be working nine to five</v>

2336
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:03.570
<v Speaker 1>for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever fucked up thing that was wrong</v>

2337
01:49:03.571 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would way rather get up in the morning</v>

2338
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and deliver newspapers for three hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day or drive limos at night.</v>

2339
01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really unstable childhood,</v>

2340
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.500
<v Speaker 1>so in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you were locked down to</v>

2341
01:49:16.501 --> 01:49:17.430
<v Speaker 1>was death.</v>

2342
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It was prison and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever malfunction of my brain,</v>

2343
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to make it work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2344
01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Survival skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2345
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a lack of like I'm not very</v>

2346
01:49:31.441 --> 01:49:33.720
<v Speaker 1>disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like I'm disciplined on the</v>

2347
01:49:33.721 --> 01:49:35.370
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disciplined at all.</v>

2348
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get obsessed with things whether I'm</v>

2349
01:49:38.491 --> 01:49:41.940
<v Speaker 1>disciplined with in certain aspects like</v>
<v Speaker 1>with exercise and I do it when I don't</v>

2350
01:49:41.941 --> 01:49:44.280
<v Speaker 1>want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to practice and I forced</v>

2351
01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:46.770
<v Speaker 1>myself to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to do things,</v>

2352
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but more of it's more of an obsession</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2353
01:49:49.691 --> 01:49:54.691
<v Speaker 1>Like I get obsessed with either goals or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks or things or puzzles or games.</v>

2354
01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I got a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's something wrong with me.</v>

2355
01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Well why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a field draining</v>

2356
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I'll play pool for 12 hours</v>

2357
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.900
<v Speaker 1>in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll,</v>

2358
01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll get obsessed with playing pool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think I'm going to be the world</v>

2359
01:50:10.511 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to practice 12 hours a day for</v>

2360
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:14.110
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

2361
01:50:14.130 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sick person.</v>

2362
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever happened to me when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

2363
01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:21.650
<v Speaker 1>like whatever weirdness in involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2364
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can get away from me.</v>

2365
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten away from me before I played</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>

2366
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:28.450
<v Speaker 1>like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day.</v>

2367
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It can get away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got have to manage whatever craziness</v>

2368
01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that makes me like focus on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I see it in my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially my middle daughter,</v>

2370
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:41.500
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets obsessed with things and I'm</v>

2371
01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:41.951
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2372
01:50:41.951 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a genetic thing.</v>

2373
01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a little female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and a lot of ways,</v>

2374
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she read all eight Harry Potter</v>

2375
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 1>books in a matter of a couple of months.</v>

2376
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:55.370
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just gets into stuff and then you've</v>

2377
01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:55.871
<v Speaker 1>got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2378
01:50:55.871 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 1>shut the light out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to bed one more chapter</v>

2379
01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.451
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2380
01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been um,</v>

2381
01:51:00.670 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not like she's seen it in me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's mirroring it because it's her own</v>

2382
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 1>little weirdness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2383
01:51:06.881 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's obviously she's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier environment than I grew up in,</v>

2384
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:16.540
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a matter of plug not ever not ever</v>

2385
01:51:16.541 --> 01:51:19.090
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be connected to anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent because nothing is permanent.</v>

2386
01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with the lessons from my</v>

2387
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's here to help you.</v>

2388
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Not As,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get locked in any fucking job,</v>

2389
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:29.010
<v Speaker 1>don't get locked in and you get ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move in anytime,</v>

2390
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And embracing moving.</v>

2391
01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:33.020

<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the fuck out of La.</v>

2393
01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do everything here.</v>

2394
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:38.410
<v Speaker 1>The comedy is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family's here.</v>

2395
01:51:38.411 --> 01:51:40.420
<v Speaker 1>My kids go to school here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my friends live here,</v>

2396
01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:41.201
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

2397
01:51:41.201 --> 01:51:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

2398
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I have this like no mad shit in me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm like constantly trying to,</v>

2399
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:50.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage.</v>

2400
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as people like to take credit</v>

2401
01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 1>for a certain amount of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can tell you all the different</v>

2402
01:51:57.881 --> 01:52:00.790
<v Speaker 1>things that I did that led to me being</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at things.</v>

2403
01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:05.080
<v Speaker 1>But almost it's like the function of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental issue,</v>

2404
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is a function of learning</v>

2405
01:52:09.701 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 1>how to manage a brain that doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else's brain.</v>

2406
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.890
<v Speaker 2>That's so I think common for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful people especially.</v>

2407
01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aware of how it works and you've</v>

2408
01:52:24.941 --> 01:52:27.940
<v Speaker 2>learned how to manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you know,</v>

2409
01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 2>that obsessive thing in so many ways it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has made you,</v>

2410
01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:34.900
<v Speaker 2>it has gotten you a certain degree of</v>
<v Speaker 2>success and all of those things,</v>

2411
01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:37.510
<v Speaker 2>survival skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compensatory strategies,</v>

2412
01:52:37.511 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their positives,</v>

2413
01:52:39.911 --> 01:52:43.270
<v Speaker 2>they have ways that they really help us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they have the ways that kind of</v>

2414
01:52:43.271 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>torture us and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>

2415
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 4>growth is really about understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the ways that this isn't doing</v>

2416
01:52:50.001 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 4>me any good and how can I be mindful of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2417
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 4>And also like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2418
01:52:55.230 --> 01:52:59.060
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I know now that like that now is</v>

2419
01:52:59.061 --> 01:53:04.061
<v Speaker 4>not then like how do I stop being</v>
<v Speaker 4>activated by old experiences in my past</v>

2420
01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:10.150
<v Speaker 4>and just have peace for where I am now</v>
<v Speaker 4>and take those gifts from the obsession</v>

2421
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:13.750
<v Speaker 4>that's made you successful but not have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the parts that kind of torture you at</v>

2422
01:53:13.751 --> 01:53:14.500
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>

2423
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel tortured.</v>

2424
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think in some ways have achieved</v>

2425
01:53:18.761 --> 01:53:22.030
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a victory over my whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental issues that I have.</v>

2426
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:24.670
<v Speaker 1>But I can't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2427
01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:30.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why I have three jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that if I do.</v>

2428
01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And I have three jobs and a fucking ton</v>
<v Speaker 1>of obsessions outside of those jobs.</v>

2429
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery or reading and writing and all</v>

2430
01:53:40.330 --> 01:53:43.450
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other stuff on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting,</v>

2431
01:53:43.451 --> 01:53:46.030
<v Speaker 1>doing the commentary for the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing standup comedy.</v>

2432
01:53:46.050 --> 01:53:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the only way I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel even.</v>

2433
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't have one thing that I count</v>

2434
01:53:51.971 --> 01:53:53.770
<v Speaker 1>on either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had,</v>

2435
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:57.160
<v Speaker 1>if I only had standup comedy or only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

2436
01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:59.650
<v Speaker 1>If there's only one thing or only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting,</v>

2437
01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my.</v>

2438
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to quit.</v>

2439
01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

2440
01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:06.790
<v Speaker 1>This is my fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be trapped doing this</v>

2441
01:54:06.791 --> 01:54:09.130
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking into a fucking microphone out</v>

2442
01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:11.920
<v Speaker 1>into space for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to fucking.</v>

2443
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to hear myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2444
01:54:13.421 --> 01:54:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I've got to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2445
01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So whatever weird malfunction my brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

2446
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I've figured out a way over all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of my life to,</v>

2447
01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.950
<v Speaker 1>to manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of his physical to managing my</v>

2448
01:54:26.951 --> 01:54:30.640
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it requires intense exercise.</v>

2449
01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I intensely exercise,</v>

2450
01:54:33.281 --> 01:54:35.190
<v Speaker 1>then I can like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh alright,</v>

2451
01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:37.570
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be cool.</v>

2452
01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:41.440
<v Speaker 1>But if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's all built up.</v>

2453
01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to enjoy things.</v>

2454
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to just chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't chill unless I earn it.</v>

2455
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:51.730
<v Speaker 1>It gets a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a malfunction,</v>

2456
01:54:51.731 --> 01:54:56.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's the illusion is that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illusion is that it's a discipline</v>

2457
01:54:56.471 --> 01:54:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and then it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all choices,</v>

2458
01:54:58.211 --> 01:55:00.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's really not the case.</v>

2459
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just you and how you operate</v>
<v Speaker 4>your operating system.</v>

2460
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Are You coaching me now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's going on here?</v>

2461
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Does that feel like I am?</v>

2462
01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is me.</v>

2463
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

2464
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:18.750
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're back to the</v>

2465
01:55:18.751 --> 01:55:22.440
<v Speaker 4>acceptance thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of ways I think we're</v>

2466
01:55:22.441 --> 01:55:26.130
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be and we look at other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and how they do their life or</v>

2467
01:55:26.131 --> 01:55:28.470
<v Speaker 4>whatever and we think that because we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>acting this way,</v>

2468
01:55:28.471 --> 01:55:30.930
<v Speaker 4>something must be wrong with us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times there is not.</v>

2469
01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:33.600
<v Speaker 4>This is just the way you operate.</v>

2470
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing is interesting is</v>

2471
01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:40.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid I was a not very</v>

2472
01:55:40.771 --> 01:55:45.390
<v Speaker 1>confident and also didn't like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people get anxiety again,</v>

2473
01:55:45.391 --> 01:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a talk and I get anxiety,</v>

2474
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 1>if I had to like talk to a bank teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I had to wait in line to go to</v>

2475
01:55:51.331 --> 01:55:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the bank teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd start freaking out like on my way to</v>

2476
01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:57.990
<v Speaker 1>the bank teller and like if you talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like people who knew me from high</v>

2477
01:55:57.991 --> 01:56:00.000
<v Speaker 1>school and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2478
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:02.310
<v Speaker 1>did you ever think that Joe is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a comedian?</v>

2479
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.010
<v Speaker 1>They be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2480
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was at funny,</v>

2481
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:11.040
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to be more relaxed</v>

2482
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>socially and it wasn't an easy process</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2483
01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It took forever to the point where now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm extremely relaxed socially.</v>

2484
01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Like now I can talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't.</v>

2485
01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I love one of the things I love about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing podcasts.</v>

2486
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I like just having conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2487
01:56:25.351 --> 01:56:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

2488
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know,</v>

2489
01:56:27.181 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 1>like you're another organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're another person.</v>

2490
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what's going on in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2491
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna own a.</v>

2492
01:56:34.271 --> 01:56:37.280
<v Speaker 1>try to see what connections you've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2493
01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.410
<v Speaker 1>what definitions you've fallen on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you've defined this world,</v>

2495
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 1>how you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you've categorized things and how</v>

2496
01:56:46.051 --> 01:56:47.120
<v Speaker 1>you're managing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>

2497
01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>how are you maneuvering through it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that.</v>

2498
01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the thoughts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people carry around inside their heads.</v>

2499
01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>led to where you are and I love that</v>

2506
01:57:16.221 --> 01:57:17.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just been easy because it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2507
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.570
<v Speaker 2>you're always like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to know you had that background and</v>

2508
01:57:20.571 --> 01:57:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you had the social anxiety and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like such a stretch.</v>

2509
01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really inspiring because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives people.</v>

2510
01:57:27.651 --> 01:57:28.471
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you,</v>

2511
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:31.190
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can no longer argue that,</v>

2512
01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just born a certain way.</v>

2513
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:35.120
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way you are,</v>

2514
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:39.440
<v Speaker 2>like your proof that you actually can</v>
<v Speaker 2>change and you can't get over things and</v>

2515
01:57:39.441 --> 01:57:42.950
<v Speaker 2>you can create things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably didn't think were possible</v>

2516
01:57:42.951 --> 01:57:45.560
<v Speaker 2>when you were 10 or however old you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were going through all that</v>

2517
01:57:45.561 --> 01:57:46.394
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2518
01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2519
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:52.770
<v Speaker 1>people have different starting points</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's like I was saying that if</v>

2520
01:57:52.771 --> 01:57:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you want to climb Mount Everest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

2521
01:57:54.691 --> 01:57:57.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're starting from Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking walk all the way to</v>

2522
01:57:57.391 --> 01:57:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Tibet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a long ass time.</v>

2523
01:57:59.930 --> 01:58:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Ocean is going to be hard to get across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're at the base of Tibet,</v>

2524
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.540
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's or the base of the Himalayas,</v>

2525
01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.050
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to climb that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2526
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it's still not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easier.</v>

2527
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

2528
01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the a metaphoric Santa Monica would</v>

2529
01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:21.480
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really far away from their goal.</v>

2530
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means there's a bunch of steps,</v>

2531
01:58:25.051 --> 01:58:28.590
<v Speaker 1>whether they're conscious or unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to have to make in</v>

2532
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:29.940
<v Speaker 1>order to get to a position.</v>

2533
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And I still remember fucking freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out going to a bank teller or used to</v>

2534
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 1>having all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to talk to people.</v>

2535
01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I was just in my own head and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>super insecure and I just could barely</v>

2536
01:58:42.671 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>get through shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2537
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 1>what changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing it over and over again.</v>

2538
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The martial arts is the first thing that</v>

2539
01:58:50.681 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I ever did where I was good at it or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel like a loser.</v>

2540
01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It was like I'd done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good at art and uh,</v>

2541
01:58:58.910 --> 01:59:00.120
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2542
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to be a comic book</v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrator and that was like a big</v>

2543
01:59:04.541 --> 01:59:07.450
<v Speaker 1>focus in my life when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2544
01:59:07.451 --> 01:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I and I definitely took some sort of</v>

2545
01:59:09.851 --> 01:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>identity in the fact that I was good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2546
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that people would say I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was good at it and made me feel good,</v>

2547
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but it was different than martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>because with martial arts,</v>

2548
01:59:20.150 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the first thing that I did where</v>

2549
01:59:23.051 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I could really be</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional.</v>

2550
01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it could be really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in an hour,</v>

2551
01:59:29.081 --> 01:59:34.081
<v Speaker 1>realized that</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all I was gifted physically and</v>

2552
01:59:34.721 --> 01:59:39.670
<v Speaker 1>then also this crazy brain of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could point it to something,</v>

2553
01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:42.700
<v Speaker 1>like I would work out at 3:00 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning because I knew nobody else</v>

2554
01:59:42.701 --> 01:59:44.410
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they weren't there,</v>

2555
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 1>so I had keys to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2556
01:59:47.231 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was teaching,</v>

2557
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:52.390
<v Speaker 1>so I would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up and I would drive down to</v>

2558
01:59:52.391 --> 01:59:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the gym and I opened it up in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the night and put in a workout</v>

2559
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:59.080
<v Speaker 1>because I knew that no one else was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

2560
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I knew they weren't there and I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it gave me an this.</v>

2561
02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2562
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>

2563
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I felt like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting ahead of them,</v>

2564
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2565
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was some sort of a crazy race.</v>

2566
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So for between the age of 15 and 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just completely obsessed with</v>

2567
02:00:18.641 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>fighting and that's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2568
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

2569
02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I probably barely knew who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

2570
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know a goddamn thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2571
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't reading shit unless it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Samurai book on philosophy and</v>

2572
02:00:32.741 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was all I was obsessed with</v>

2573
02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I was also a gun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were Ah,</v>

2574
02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>anthony robins somewhere around that</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2575
02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>But I was interested in like things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would give me an edge,</v>

2576
02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>personal development stuff that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me an edge and then through doing</v>

2577
02:00:47.351 --> 02:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and then also through</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching,</v>

2578
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a big one was teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

2579
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>And then teaching at bu was big too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was teaching at Boston</v>

2580
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching an actual class.</v>

2581
02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Are you teaching taekwondo window?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was at that time I was a.</v>

2582
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd won the US Open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd won a bunch of different tournaments</v>

2583
02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing really well as a,</v>

2584
02:01:10.091 --> 02:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a martial arts competitor.</v>

2585
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2586
02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>they had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a taekwondo program at Bu and I was</v>

2587
02:01:15.971 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>teaching it and I would have to address</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole class,</v>

2588
02:01:19.751 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>but I would address all classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was really good at,</v>

2589
02:01:22.330 --> 02:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>like I knew I could demonstrate them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2590
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>some movements and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows some things.</v>

2591
02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd asked someone to hold something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd kick it or something like that and</v>

2592
02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2593
02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they would listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could get,</v>

2594
02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was confident in what I was saying</v>

2595
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:37.623
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2596
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the only time in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can remember being confident in</v>

2597
02:01:41.601 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>telling people something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I would describe how you do</v>

2598
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how you do it and I'll show you</v>

2599
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>how to do it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is how it needs to be done.</v>

2600
02:01:49.221 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens when you do it.</v>

2601
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And this is what's involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of your body.</v>

2602
02:01:53.901 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that,</v>

2603
02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>that gave me the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the first feeling that I got</v>

2604
02:01:59.841 --> 02:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was I,</v>

2605
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there was like a light at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the tunnel or at least I</v>

2606
02:02:04.521 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at least this now I don't feel like</v>

2607
02:02:07.071 --> 02:02:07.904
<v Speaker 1>a loser anymore.</v>

2608
02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:10.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2609
02:02:10.150 --> 02:02:12.670
<v Speaker 4>It gave you something to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2610
02:02:12.671 --> 02:02:16.270
<v Speaker 4>be exceptional at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what gives us</v>

2611
02:02:16.271 --> 02:02:20.530
<v Speaker 4>confidence is feeling like we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat mastered something like</v>

2612
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.850
<v Speaker 4>somewhat really could understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>something well enough to teach it.</v>

2613
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And without that we're just chasing it I</v>

2614
02:02:28.781 --> 02:02:32.680
<v Speaker 4>think for and trying to get it through</v>
<v Speaker 4>little things we do.</v>

2615
02:02:32.681 --> 02:02:35.070
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's why a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go from career to career,</v>

2616
02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.240
<v Speaker 4>job to job or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to find that little bit of</v>

2617
02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:40.600
<v Speaker 4>instead of sticking with something and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really focusing in on really</v>

2618
02:02:40.601 --> 02:02:42.400
<v Speaker 4>studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I think the obsession</v>

2619
02:02:42.401 --> 02:02:44.320
<v Speaker 4>actually served in a lot of ways.</v>

2620
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also an expression that I love</v>

2621
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>to use that martial arts are a vehicle</v>
<v Speaker 1>for developing your human potential</v>

2622
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's so difficult and it's so</v>

2623
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the idea of competing and in</v>

2624
02:02:56.770 --> 02:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the physical consequences are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

2625
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>If you get hit that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

2626
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't have asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't slack off,</v>

2627
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to really pursue this thing</v>

2628
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>with an insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an incredible intensity and then</v>

2629
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>through that you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2630
02:03:13.581 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from doing that you kind of</v>

2631
02:03:16.761 --> 02:03:17.241
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2632
02:03:17.241 --> 02:03:22.241
<v Speaker 1>what if I apply that to writing a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing that or learning how to do</v>

2633
02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or for me it was standup comedy.</v>

2634
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seat,</v>

2635
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 4>standup comedy seems just terrifying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2636
02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Karen</v>

2637
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>terrifying is working in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>office wearing tassels,</v>

2638
02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>shiny shoes.</v>

2639
02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:37.550
<v Speaker 4>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid thing.</v>

2640
02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.520
<v Speaker 4>Socks are too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2641
02:03:39.521 --> 02:03:41.650
<v Speaker 4>That was terrifying for me to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2642
02:03:41.651 --> 02:03:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I remember like Sunday nights I would</v>
<v Speaker 4>just get knots in my stomach just like,</v>

2643
02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:50.170
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I have to go and be in awful staff</v>

2644
02:03:50.171 --> 02:03:55.120
<v Speaker 4>meetings on Monday mornings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just like draining all sucking the</v>

2645
02:03:55.121 --> 02:04:00.121
<v Speaker 4>oxygen out of their own life out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where a lot of people start</v>

2646
02:04:00.431 --> 02:04:01.900
<v Speaker 4>taking medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2647
02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2648
02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:07.380
<v Speaker 1>That unhappiness of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of just what you call quote unquote real</v>

2649
02:04:07.381 --> 02:04:10.320
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a structure that's put in</v>

2650
02:04:10.321 --> 02:04:15.321
<v Speaker 1>place that we've all sort of shuffled</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that doesn't serve us and it</v>

2651
02:04:15.961 --> 02:04:18.780
<v Speaker 1>doesn't serve most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have Wim Hoff on last night,</v>

2652
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a telling me about him.</v>

2653
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he and I were</v>

2654
02:04:23.371 --> 02:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2655
02:04:24.090 --> 02:04:26.100
<v Speaker 1>He gave me his number about what did he</v>
<v Speaker 1>say?</v>

2656
02:04:26.101 --> 02:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Like seven percent of people or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2657
02:04:28.261 --> 02:04:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Do things that are creative with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2658
02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:31.970
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven percent,</v>

2659
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>70 percent world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2660
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get crazy and say it's 15 percent.</v>

2661
02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:39.390
<v Speaker 1>That's really small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2662
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

2663
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent of kids are</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>

2664
02:04:42.570 --> 02:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my kids,</v>

2665
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>they're both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both always do.</v>

2666
02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>My young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both always painting or drawing</v>

2667
02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>or doing something in my older kid does</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

2668
02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:57.620
<v Speaker 1>so there's so much creativity that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel drawn to it and all that stuff</v>

2669
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:02.870
<v Speaker 1>is something that every kid does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2670
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Every kid draws shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every kid plays with clay.</v>

2671
02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Every kid make stuff with legos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all like put things together,</v>

2672
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line we're</v>

2673
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>stuffed into this structure that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve us.</v>

2674
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Then if we feel like we have to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've been shuffled through</v>

2675
02:05:20.131 --> 02:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>school and into college and then we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt and then we have to take</v>

2676
02:05:24.421 --> 02:05:27.690
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and these opportunities is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good opportunity,</v>

2677
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good,</v>

2678
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>good career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2679
02:05:30.730 --> 02:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an end like,</v>

2680
02:05:32.651 --> 02:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>to go back to what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

2681
02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these systems that we've built are so</v>

2682
02:05:37.721 --> 02:05:42.721
<v Speaker 2>antiquated and so outdated from politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the school system and it all needs</v>

2683
02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:46.850
<v Speaker 2>change and we're seeing it start to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2684
02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>ever seen it start to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way we educate kids,</v>

2685
02:05:49.631 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>the way we relate to add and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2686
02:05:52.421 --> 02:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I think so much of add is like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>current system and the way kids are like</v>

2687
02:05:56.950 --> 02:06:01.630
<v Speaker 2>confined in this classroom and have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow these rules and sit still all day</v>

2688
02:06:01.631 --> 02:06:04.600
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no nurturing of creativity.</v>

2689
02:06:04.630 --> 02:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2690
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:09.250
<v Speaker 2>so I think over time a lot of this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to start to change.</v>

2691
02:06:09.251 --> 02:06:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I hope so because we just can't squat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this with kids all.</v>

2692
02:06:13.410 --> 02:06:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I have three nephews and I see the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2693
02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:17.920
<v Speaker 2>They're so creative and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>confident.</v>

2694
02:06:17.921 --> 02:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>They don't care what other people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

2695
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a lot of fear.</v>

2696
02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:23.740
<v Speaker 2>They and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they do do something creative,</v>

2697
02:06:23.741 --> 02:06:24.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't judge it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2698
02:06:24.881 --> 02:06:28.450
<v Speaker 2>is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just enjoy the process and</v>

2699
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:31.870
<v Speaker 2>that starts to phase out as we get older</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we get obsessed with other people</v>

2700
02:06:31.871 --> 02:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>thinking isn't good enough and is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe and will this please my parents and</v>

2701
02:06:36.190 --> 02:06:37.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will I be able to make money this way?</v>

2702
02:06:37.871 --> 02:06:42.871
<v Speaker 2>And we just get so disconnected from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that childlike creativity and wonder and</v>

2703
02:06:42.941 --> 02:06:46.750
<v Speaker 2>curiosity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of no fear and faith in</v>

2704
02:06:46.751 --> 02:06:50.530
<v Speaker 2>ourselves that we just get stuck in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of checklist.</v>

2705
02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Tassel wearing life.</v>

2706
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's another tassels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tassels,</v>

2707
02:06:55.001 --> 02:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>our enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's another thing that we</v>

2708
02:06:58.211 --> 02:07:00.550
<v Speaker 1>need to consider and this is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to people that are like,</v>

2709
02:07:00.551 --> 02:07:01.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit,</v>

2710
02:07:01.541 --> 02:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>dreamer talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this because this is real.</v>

2711
02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:08.170
<v Speaker 1>That corporate worlds only been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>for less than 100 years.</v>

2712
02:07:08.590 --> 02:07:13.590
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing in modern life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern life is new in terms of the</v>

2713
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.530
<v Speaker 1>length of time human beings have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

2714
02:07:18.070 --> 02:07:23.070
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing and it doesn't serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and maybe with technological</v>

2715
02:07:24.611 --> 02:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>innovation and robots and automation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different shit that's coming</v>

2716
02:07:28.481 --> 02:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there'll be less and less</v>

2717
02:07:30.581 --> 02:07:33.160
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for you to work a slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>job and you'll have to do something</v>

2718
02:07:33.161 --> 02:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be more and more compelling,</v>

2719
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but this world that we've structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't serve us is incredibly</v>

2720
02:07:41.261 --> 02:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>recent and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not rigid.</v>

2721
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2722
02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like you do.</v>

2723
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's actually really cool about</v>

2724
02:07:51.371 --> 02:07:52.760
<v Speaker 2>millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>

2725
02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:57.450
<v Speaker 2>the generation that's now like 20 to 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 ish.</v>

2726
02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:01.000
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things I talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>generational diversity and millennials</v>

2727
02:08:01.001 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>and they're demanding a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of workplace.</v>

2728
02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>They're more likely to take a job where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have more creativity.</v>

2729
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>The culture is like less cubical base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have more freedom than a job with</v>

2730
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:18.130
<v Speaker 2>the salary and the benefits and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not relating to work in the same way.</v>

2731
02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:20.540
<v Speaker 2>They're really questioning the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradigms there.</v>

2732
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand like why do I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be there from nine to five if I can like</v>

2733
02:08:24.221 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 2>get this done at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2734
02:08:25.710 --> 02:08:28.870
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of time and a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are starting their own</v>

2735
02:08:28.871 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 2>businesses and doing the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional path.</v>

2736
02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:36.220
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're already starting to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it change because we have a generation</v>

2737
02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 2>that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the millennial generation is</v>

2738
02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 2>ginormous and there they are demanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things from work and making</v>

2739
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:44.950
<v Speaker 2>different choices already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's already shifting.</v>

2740
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Already shifting.</v>

2741
02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think another thing that's</v>

2742
02:08:47.781 --> 02:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>bullshit is the amount of time that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to make a living just to</v>

2743
02:08:51.921 --> 02:08:56.030
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people are barely being</v>

2744
02:08:56.031 --> 02:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>able to feed themselves and housed</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they're giving up their</v>

2745
02:08:59.751 --> 02:09:03.140
<v Speaker 1>entire day and their entire week and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

2746
02:09:03.170 --> 02:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that Saturday,</v>

2747
02:09:05.421 --> 02:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Sunday off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time on Saturday and</v>

2748
02:09:07.761 --> 02:09:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Sunday if you have an office job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some shit that you brought home</v>

2749
02:09:11.181 --> 02:09:12.590
<v Speaker 1>with you that you have to sort through.</v>

2750
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's the whole payment systems</v>

2751
02:09:17.151 --> 02:09:22.151
<v Speaker 2>crazy and you see like these instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities making all this money just</v>

2752
02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:27.320
<v Speaker 2>by posting pictures and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody going to a job like nine to</v>

2753
02:09:27.321 --> 02:09:29.720
<v Speaker 2>five day after day after day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely scraping by.</v>

2754
02:09:29.721 --> 02:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2755
02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Well what freaks me out as people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just move money around and they make</v>

2756
02:09:35.631 --> 02:09:38.390
<v Speaker 1>billions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like think about like hedge fund people</v>

2757
02:09:38.391 --> 02:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2758
02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>You're moving numbers around and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making numbers and how much,</v>

2759
02:09:43.670 --> 02:09:47.330
<v Speaker 1>how much are you extracting while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving stuff around.</v>

2760
02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with this woman</v>

2761
02:09:51.351 --> 02:09:54.830
<v Speaker 1>who was a staunch Republican who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that the minimum wage,</v>

2762
02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so adamant that you can't raise</v>

2763
02:09:58.251 --> 02:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2764
02:09:59.571 --> 02:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2765
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>was $15 an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would crush businesses.</v>

2766
02:10:03.611 --> 02:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It would do this or do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2767
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:07.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people disagree like you don't</v>

2768
02:10:07.311 --> 02:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>know whether or not that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2769
02:10:08.721 --> 02:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>do you want to work for less than 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks an hour?</v>

2770
02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:12.051
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2771
02:10:12.051 --> 02:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>these are entry level jobs and this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2772
02:10:13.710 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still requiring an hour of</v>

2773
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:19.280
<v Speaker 1>someone's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your job,</v>

2774
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:21.770
<v Speaker 1>if you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a business and your business</v>

2775
02:10:21.771 --> 02:10:24.740
<v Speaker 1>can't pay someone $15 for an hour of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their time,</v>

2776
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:28.040
<v Speaker 1>your business is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>

2777
02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Or you have too many employees or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2778
02:10:30.351 --> 02:10:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2779
02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not set up right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're the person who's at the</v>

2780
02:10:35.451 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>lowest rung of the food chain to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hit.</v>

2781
02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Not The business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a business,</v>

2782
02:10:41.031 --> 02:10:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you came and pay someone $15 for a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour of working.</v>

2783
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:47.170
<v Speaker 1>How much money are you generating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need all this business and</v>

2784
02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>why don't you know as employees do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2785
02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an efficient business and I</v>

2786
02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:54.320
<v Speaker 1>wonder what's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>automation and with,</v>

2787
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:55.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2788
02:10:55.201 --> 02:11:00.080
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about like a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of jobs that are being done right</v>

2789
02:11:00.081 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 1>now by people that are going to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>by robots and it's just a matter of</v>

2790
02:11:04.461 --> 02:11:05.250
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2791
02:11:05.250 --> 02:11:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's even more important to nurture</v>

2792
02:11:07.741 --> 02:11:12.120
<v Speaker 4>your creativity and know what you can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>besides rely on the man or the</v>

2793
02:11:12.121 --> 02:11:15.360
<v Speaker 4>corporation or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think a lot of people think</v>

2794
02:11:15.361 --> 02:11:20.361
<v Speaker 4>that safety and economic security is in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is in working for someone else and</v>

2795
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:21.833
<v Speaker 4>working for a quarter,</v>

2796
02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:24.700
<v Speaker 1>getting a good job of climbing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder.</v>

2797
02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Shoot your brains out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping off a building.</v>

2798
02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2799
02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2800
02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:36.250
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a long run.</v>

2801
02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes by really some 49 and I feel</v>

2802
02:11:39.771 --> 02:11:41.920
<v Speaker 1>like it was 20 yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2803
02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.890
<v Speaker 1>it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>

2804
02:11:44.891 --> 02:11:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll be 59 and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be 69.</v>

2805
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be able to close my eyes and</v>

2806
02:11:50.381 --> 02:11:53.200
<v Speaker 1>hear the yawning grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>

2807
02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It's coming for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2808
02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GotTa have fun while you're here.</v>

2809
02:11:58.450 --> 02:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>If in any way possible.</v>

2810
02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say that I think regret is far</v>

2811
02:12:03.071 --> 02:12:08.071
<v Speaker 4>worse than risk far like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather take risks in my life than</v>

2812
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:14.460
<v Speaker 4>regret playing it safe or staying in</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations that I knew weren't,</v>

2813
02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:16.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

2814
02:12:16.961 --> 02:12:19.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>

2815
02:12:19.181 --> 02:12:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's no guarantee,</v>

2816
02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:23.320
<v Speaker 4>but at least you do it.</v>

2817
02:12:23.590 --> 02:12:24.770
<v Speaker 1>That's where she comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2818
02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:25.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2819
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2820
02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what forces you to move.</v>

2821
02:12:29.171 --> 02:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gets things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2822
02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Every two years I throw away my act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write a new one.</v>

2823
02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a special,</v>

2824
02:12:35.861 --> 02:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like my netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I abandoned all those jokes and I have</v>

2825
02:12:38.681 --> 02:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>to write a whole new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking terrifying.</v>

2826
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I keep doing it and every time I do</v>

2827
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:47.103
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets better.</v>

2828
02:12:47.410 --> 02:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>If I keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep focusing on it.</v>

2829
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm all that terror and fear of taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chance.</v>

2830
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me get better at it and that's a</v>

2831
02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.890
<v Speaker 1>pretty minor thing because it's not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much financial concern and I'll be</v>

2832
02:12:59.891 --> 02:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for someone to take a chance</v>

2833
02:13:03.130 --> 02:13:06.320
<v Speaker 1>financially and take a chance their</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and they don't really know what,</v>

2834
02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:08.710
<v Speaker 1>what the future holds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they have all these things</v>

2835
02:13:08.711 --> 02:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>to fall back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you fucking dig.</v>

2836
02:13:11.891 --> 02:13:15.350
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you make things happen and</v>

2837
02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>

2838
02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just stay soft and lazy.</v>

2839
02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:22.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you never really discover your true</v>

2840
02:13:22.871 --> 02:13:26.170
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just stay comfortable.</v>

2841
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Christina's people out there right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are listening,</v>

2842
02:13:29.150 --> 02:13:30.770
<v Speaker 1>that are getting fired up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen this right now,</v>

2843
02:13:30.771 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 1>they're jogging in place and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2844
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to listen to Christine.</v>

2845
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good,</v>

2846
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.881
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2847
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good,</v>

2848
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 4>but don't just like you just broke the</v>
<v Speaker 4>letter.</v>

2849
02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Can you really end it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't feel motivated,</v>

2850
02:13:46.921 --> 02:13:51.921
<v Speaker 4>like actually like commit to one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's one thing you can do to start</v>

2851
02:13:53.041 --> 02:13:55.530
<v Speaker 4>shifting your life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

2852
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finding that hobby?</v>

2853
02:13:57.511 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 4>Is it like having a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your boss?</v>

2854
02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Is it going after that creative</v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor,</v>

2855
02:14:01.471 --> 02:14:03.450
<v Speaker 4>like just start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing.</v>

2856
02:14:03.451 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Like people think they have to know all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the steps.</v>

2857
02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like I want to get to the second</v>
<v Speaker 4>floor,</v>

2858
02:14:09.301 --> 02:14:13.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the bottom of the staircase and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think I just have to jump to get</v>

2859
02:14:13.351 --> 02:14:14.220
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2860
02:14:14.221 --> 02:14:17.490
<v Speaker 4>like you go step by step by step,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like you'd walk up the staircase so</v>

2861
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:20.970
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to know it all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just taking that first step and</v>

2862
02:14:20.971 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 4>then that leads to another and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>leads to another and like you said,</v>

2863
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:26.130
<v Speaker 4>like it's so scary moments where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>find your grit and you find your</v>

2864
02:14:26.131 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 4>potential and you find out how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>respond to adversity and you find your</v>

2865
02:14:29.821 --> 02:14:32.970
<v Speaker 4>true gifts and you can only do that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty and when you're</v>

2866
02:14:32.971 --> 02:14:35.430
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe she'd be a clarity advisor.</v>

2867
02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:37.930
<v Speaker 4>The clarity advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like of psychic.</v>

2868
02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:38.411
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2869
02:14:38.411 --> 02:14:39.270
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarity.</v>

2870
02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:40.163
<v Speaker 4>Clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2871
02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:44.120
<v Speaker 4>What a psychic wouldn't be a cleric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my new.</v>

2872
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.911
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

2873
02:14:44.911 --> 02:14:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I clarity advisor.</v>

2874
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:48.440
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>

2875
02:14:48.441 --> 02:14:50.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a little wordy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not perfect.</v>

2876
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:54.120
<v Speaker 4>It's we're getting closer to step step.</v>

2877
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:57.310
<v Speaker 1>There's something there like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

2878
02:14:57.320 --> 02:14:59.730
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I tell people that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is really important,</v>

2879
02:14:59.731 --> 02:15:03.450
<v Speaker 1>it's helped me a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is write the things down that you need</v>

2880
02:15:03.451 --> 02:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a checklist as far as your day like</v>

2881
02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the best way to get shit done is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stare that Goddamn list and say,</v>

2882
02:15:12.121 --> 02:15:12.871
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2883
02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>did I work out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I write?</v>

2884
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Did I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I do that?</v>

2885
02:15:15.961 --> 02:15:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Then take care of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2886
02:15:17.761 --> 02:15:20.430
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff that you need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it at the beginning of the day or do</v>

2887
02:15:20.431 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 1>it when you go to bed at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even better before you go to</v>

2888
02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 1>bed at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set your intention for the next day.</v>

2889
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get all this shit done</v>

2890
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give Yourself Fifteen,</v>

2891
02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:30.120
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have it.</v>

2892
02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got 15 minutes and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down,</v>

2893
02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:36.900
<v Speaker 1>put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on a piece of paper and the next</v>

2894
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>day check that shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Do those things and if you could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in the habit of doing that.</v>

2896
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to avoid because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>love to just be lazy.</v>

2897
02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:48.390
<v Speaker 1>They love the distraction of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing</v>

2898
02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:49.440
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have time.</v>

2899
02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying they don't have time,</v>

2900
02:15:51.401 --> 02:15:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is one that has been incredibly</v>

2901
02:15:54.131 --> 02:15:58.780
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to me is writing things down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making a list and forcing myself to</v>

2902
02:15:59.110 --> 02:16:00.730
<v Speaker 1>check all the shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on that list.</v>

2903
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and doing the things you don't always</v>

2904
02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:05.230
<v Speaker 4>feel like doing and and also being</v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable that people like having</v>

2905
02:16:05.231 --> 02:16:07.000
<v Speaker 4>somebody that's like calling you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>

2906
02:16:07.001 --> 02:16:08.740
<v Speaker 4>did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did you do it?</v>

2907
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Did you show up for yourself because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes momentum.</v>

2908
02:16:11.570 --> 02:16:13.810
<v Speaker 4>You are they making these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes?</v>

2909
02:16:13.811 --> 02:16:17.560
<v Speaker 4>You have to build momentum and if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have that checklist and you're doing</v>

2910
02:16:17.561 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one thing every day and maybe the</v>

2911
02:16:19.991 --> 02:16:22.720
<v Speaker 4>first thing you're going to do is commit</v>
<v Speaker 4>to making a list everyday.</v>

2912
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:26.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a great step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you start showing up for yourself</v>

2913
02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:28.750
<v Speaker 4>every day and doing that and checking</v>
<v Speaker 4>things off the list,</v>

2914
02:16:28.751 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 4>you start build self trust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start to have more integrity with</v>

2915
02:16:30.941 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start to build momentum and then</v>

2916
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to take the next step and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next thing,</v>

2917
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.770
<v Speaker 4>but without that momentum and without</v>
<v Speaker 4>that commitment,</v>

2918
02:16:38.771 --> 02:16:43.771
<v Speaker 4>I think people just expect their life to</v>
<v Speaker 4>change like this and like we've talked</v>

2919
02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:46.630
<v Speaker 4>about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it just doesn't,</v>

2920
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 4>but those little steps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start to make you feel better too</v>

2921
02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.230
<v Speaker 4>because you start to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

2922
02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:57.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing the same thing over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over because that really is insanity.</v>

2923
02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.970
<v Speaker 4>But went on Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who said insanity is doing the same</v>

2924
02:17:00.971 --> 02:17:03.130
<v Speaker 4>thing over and over again expecting a</v>
<v Speaker 4>different result.</v>

2925
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:05.560
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to me is crazy.</v>

2926
02:17:05.561 --> 02:17:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Making</v>

2927
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it is and also there's a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to be aware of in that is</v>

2928
02:17:11.051 --> 02:17:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the trap of falling back into old</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns because they offer you comfort.</v>

2929
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:17.710
<v Speaker 1>That happens to a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to lose weight.</v>

2930
02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Losing weight is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start,</v>

2931
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 1>they start off good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start losing weight,</v>

2932
02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:25.990
<v Speaker 1>they start looking great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then somewhere along the line,</v>

2933
02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:29.780
<v Speaker 1>that old pattern calls to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'm fucking</v>

2934
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:30.491
<v Speaker 4>donut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2935
02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:33.900
<v Speaker 4>You've won or you've earned a donut</v>
<v Speaker 4>krispy kremes get a couple of them and</v>

2936
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:37.120
<v Speaker 4>some big deal tomorrow you get back on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>track and you just never do.</v>

2937
02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:39.790
<v Speaker 4>You never get back on track and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2938
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 4>it's really common for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's cigarette smoking or you</v>

2939
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:43.991
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank,</v>

2940
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Old Patterns are really hard.</v>

2941
02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:52.480
<v Speaker 4>They're really hard to avoid because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they offer some sort of bizarre comfort.</v>

2942
02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like coping strategies and so</v>

2943
02:17:54.941 --> 02:17:58.360
<v Speaker 4>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean so many people eat or smoke or</v>

2944
02:17:58.361 --> 02:18:03.361
<v Speaker 4>whatever for comfort or to self soothe</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves and so they can either make a</v>

2945
02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:06.820
<v Speaker 4>new year's resolution and lose the</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight and then if they haven't found</v>

2946
02:18:06.821 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 4>another way to cope with life when</v>
<v Speaker 4>things get hard or</v>

2947
02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 4>someone upsets them or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to turn to that old</v>

2948
02:18:16.061 --> 02:18:21.040
<v Speaker 4>coping device because they haven't dealt</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the issue underneath what made them</v>

2949
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.230
<v Speaker 4>overeat or drink or smoke in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2950
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also when you're filled with</v>

2951
02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 1>angst and she's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things are fucked up in your</v>

2952
02:18:30.371 --> 02:18:32.080
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about those old</v>

2953
02:18:32.081 --> 02:18:34.060
<v Speaker 1>patterns like give you a big hug.</v>

2954
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:38.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do that like a warm fuzzy blanket,</v>

2955
02:18:38.201 --> 02:18:41.020
<v Speaker 4>but it's really disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Covered with bacteria.</v>

2956
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.653
