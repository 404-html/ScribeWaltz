17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>They stopped it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>entertain myself,</v>

20
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I would just do it again.</v>

21
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I met a lot of really nice people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morning TV.</v>

22
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.390

23
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad idea from the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>do impressions while he's in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that amazing rant?</v>

120
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that people were in his </v>

121
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 4>ear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were they telling them,</v>

122
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

123
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 4>just watch him time to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get them to change it,</v>

124
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.340
<v Speaker 4>change the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they put something in his ear,</v>

125
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:19.630
<v Speaker 4>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they,</v>

126
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 4>those guys have earpieces?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

127
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Usually most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

128
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Earpieces is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

129
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 4>When someone's talking in your ear and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking is one of the most </v>

130
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 4>distracting things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to hear someone talk</v>

131
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 4>and then still maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys do that in the fights.</v>

132
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 4>Very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are so good at,</v>

133
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 4>but when you pop it in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never talked.</v>

134
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 4>They never talk over me like there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

135
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so good.</v>

136
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Is that earpiece feeding you anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>though or just.</v>

137
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your voice is that producers can.</v>

138
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can talk.</v>

139
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 4>We're going to ask them about a specific</v>
<v Speaker 4>replay,</v>

140
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show me that again.</v>

141
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:58.571
<v Speaker 4>Can you show me that for an overhead?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see where that landed or </v>

142
00:06:58.571 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

143
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I mark della Grotta and I will</v>

144
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 4>have conversations like I'll ask him </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

145
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:10.481
<v Speaker 4>is this a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good piece of advice that </v>

146
00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:10.481
<v Speaker 4>someone's given.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you agree?</v>

147
00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he and I will have discussions about</v>

148
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 4>whether we agree with certain tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

149
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Which is an interesting discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>because mark is like a real world class </v>

150
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 4>trainer knows a lot about Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically and a lot about mma.</v>

151
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Did they ever feed you something where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

152
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 4>it totally blows your mind like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

153
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize that's what happened.</v>

154
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.320
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have sometimes you'll see something </v>

155
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 4>like they'll see something on a replay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe someone catches it like a,</v>

156
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:41.620
<v Speaker 4>a break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ankle or a weird role of an,</v>

157
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.230
<v Speaker 4>of a knee or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

158
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 4>I do watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

159
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 4>We'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you go,</v>

160
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll show it to me.</v>

161
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

162
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll have like conversation,</v>

163
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

164
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 4>we need to show that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll replace something.</v>

165
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking until I was watching it,</v>

166
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking on instagram that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were in Toronto and you did a show and </v>

167
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:08.291
<v Speaker 4>then you did the fights the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking as like watching you </v>

168
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:08.291
<v Speaker 4>do the call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fights.</v>

169
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

170
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:13.691
<v Speaker 4>there's no other broadcaster in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>major sports were like the night before </v>

171
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 4>he had as good a time as you did.</v>

172
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no way Al Michaels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Collingsworth or like tonight </v>

173
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.481
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fucking party with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fans and then tomorrow we'll call the </v>

174
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 4>cowboys and the giants like that never </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens for sure.</v>

175
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to like really have the best </v>

176
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 4>trips that are work trips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about it,</v>

177
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

178
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 4>they're so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking nuts.</v>

179
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 4>But even when I don't do a show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still love the fight.</v>

180
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 4>UFC is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

181
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Live watching live fights man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially now that I'm loosened up my </v>

182
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 4>schedule so I to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

183
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I go like half as much.</v>

184
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's only North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of those big crazy trips.</v>

186
00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It just take too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They break you down,</v>

187
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it takes too many days to recover from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

188
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>It's killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kills you.</v>

189
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on top of that it's a,</v>

190
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's the right amount for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just still be super enthusiastic </v>

191
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>about it and there's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

192
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't become a hardcore mma guy,</v>

193
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>but now I watch it casually and enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

194
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but the whole reason is that I went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it live.</v>

195
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Going to alive changes your perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

196
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I've only been to a few other sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

198
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.940
<v Speaker 1>We've been to baseball games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball games.</v>

199
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Been to a hockey game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basketball lives will change your </v>

200
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

201
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Just how enormous they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how athletic and how fast and the shit </v>

202
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

203
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible when you see the </v>

204
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:50.900
<v Speaker 1>footwork and the movement when they like</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing some sort of a crazy layup.</v>

205
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn,</v>

206
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it's super athleticism while people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stop you from doing it.</v>

207
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>People in not that much space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're at basketball live,</v>

208
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that much room on.</v>

209
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially on on a half court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.860
<v Speaker 1>it takes this laser beam focused to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to stop and put that ball exactly </v>

211
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skill to the way that they pass.</v>

212
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Lebron's like on top of being this super</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete and everything,</v>

214
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.681
<v Speaker 1>his passing skills are absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at a passing real time </v>

215
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he even.</v>

216
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I think even people that play </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

217
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.390
<v Speaker 1>how did you even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he'll go in a direction and </v>

218
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>anticipate that someone's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else within seconds and then </v>

219
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>we'll behind like behind his head pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's you,</v>

220
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you just can't put it together.</v>

221
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think these are the things they </v>

222
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>work on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must,</v>

223
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>it must work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

224
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they work on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think at,</v>

225
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>at their level and players like at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

226
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just second nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much improvisation.</v>

227
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a creative game and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>

229
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

230
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

231
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 1>it's really fucking amazing to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level,</v>

232
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 1>high level anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:02.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't like soccer that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will watch like I don't watch it </v>

234
00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>regularly,</v>

00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a child next to them.</v>

353
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I looked like a,</v>

354
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.950
<v Speaker 1>an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little boy meeting a superman or </v>

355
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant human being.</v>

356
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>He's a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>

357
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 1>enormous man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make people.</v>

358
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:08.411
<v Speaker 1>We watched a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we looked at this website that held </v>

359
00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:12.311
<v Speaker 1>up all the various heights and weights </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like nfl players from 20,</v>

360
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago in Paris.</v>

361
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>In today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like night and day.</v>

362
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:17.130
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I remember lineman </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

364
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 1>which is the biggest players in </v>
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>

365
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 1>We're like two 75 was the standard way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when people would say that you go,</v>

366
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking humongous got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm like eight,</v>

367
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:34.931
<v Speaker 1>nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to 75 and that was the thing and </v>

368
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:38.351
<v Speaker 1>it was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy weighed 300 pounds and if </v>

369
00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:42.401
<v Speaker 1>you're over 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were an anomaly like human </v>

370
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:42.401
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fridge.</v>

371
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the thing.</v>

372
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:48.251
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the biggest human in the </v>

373
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:51.011
<v Speaker 1>NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them the fridge and he was </v>

374
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 1>like fatter and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't believe,</v>

375
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a thing to be like,</v>

376
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:57.341
<v Speaker 1>this guy is over 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you weighed 300 and you were </v>

377
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>playing on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be underweight.</v>

378
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 1>You'd be one of the light guys because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that are 3:30,</v>

379
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.670
<v Speaker 1>3:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing that position and athletic guys </v>

380
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while to really huge man.</v>

381
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

382
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>How much bigger can they get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's maximum size?</v>

383
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought about there was this guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>played,</v>

384
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't really great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was six,</v>

385
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.310
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>406.</v>

386
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 pounds.</v>

387
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a human being.</v>

388
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Exactly like imagine if like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was six,</v>

389
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 pounds.</v>

390
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>The world would be a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

391
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

392
00:17:38.171 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>five to 89,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy's really fast.</v>

393
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Really athletic box jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

394
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just look what that just says.</v>

395
00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It says he made a</v>

396
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 4>61 inch box jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is insane for the average person to</v>

397
00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:59.390
<v Speaker 4>understand how insane that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how do.</v>

398
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.430
<v Speaker 4>How do you describe how insane it is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch a almost 300 pound man?</v>

399
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Launched himself literally five feet </v>

402
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.750
<v Speaker 4>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the size of this perk I stood in </v>

403
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 4>the middle of his wife says,</v>

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 4>He felt the a Cheeto and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leo Machida was a,</v>

431
00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly 200 plus pounds in the Machida </v>

433
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:40.740

<v Speaker 4>at 1:45.</v>

434
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.950

438
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.350

<v Speaker 4>60 or something like that.</v>

439
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.900

<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>compete at different weight classes.</v>

462
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.100

465
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.841

<v Speaker 5>he just had this intense belief in </v>

466
00:21:06.841 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 5>himself and he would be super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super aggressive too,</v>

472
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 5>grappler and it was interesting matchup </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of Bj scrapping pedigree like Bj</v>

473
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:29.911
<v Speaker 5>was on the Monday aisles and count Luna </v>
<v Speaker 5>was thought to be like a really good </v>

<v Speaker 5>and just starched them.</v>

478
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

479
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 5>Believes that he's gonna knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was just so good.</v>

480
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 5>People who didn't get to see him live </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was in his prime.</v>

481
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 5>Bj was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was so good.</v>

482
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Like when he beat Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember thinking damn like that was </v>

483
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 5>what I think what you call it peak Bj.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bj was like,</v>

484
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:58.600
<v Speaker 5>he beat Sean Sherk who destroyed Sean </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sherk who was a really tough fighter.</v>

485
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 5>Like people forget how good Sean Sean </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sherk was up like a human pit bull.</v>

486
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 5>This dude was just jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super strong wrestler.</v>

487
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Just super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super good.</v>

488
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 5>So Vj,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go into it with a,</v>

489
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 5>like a trained background or just like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>scrappy fighter,</v>

490
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was very trained,</v>

491
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's very technical,</v>

492
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 5>especially on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

493
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:18.660
<v Speaker 5>he's really high level and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

494
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Super Technical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he stopped because he was like that </v>

495
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 5>when he came in to fight it.</v>

496
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

497
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't know like where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when is,</v>

498
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.850
<v Speaker 5>when he started his striking out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know he got his black belt in </v>

499
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu in three years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just bananas fast.</v>

500
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Like one 10th of one percent fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

501
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

502
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you getting a black belt in Jujitsu</v>

503
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:44.971
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you're a real [inaudible] you </v>

504
00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 5>can get it into like seven years as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenom.</v>

505
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few guys that'll get it </v>

506
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 5>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

507
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 5>like if you have some particular talent </v>
<v Speaker 5>physically,</v>

508
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 5>which seems like a lot of people equate </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts,</v>

509
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 5>rightly so with technique is the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>important thing.</v>

510
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 5>It absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

511
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.610
<v Speaker 5>But another thing that is almost as </v>
<v Speaker 5>important as technique is physical </v>

512
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:05.860
<v Speaker 5>dexterity of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

513
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 5>What you can do and what you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your body.</v>

514
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.200
<v Speaker 5>Some people are super flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like pj PJ's ridiculously flexible and </v>

515
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Bj would rap guys up with his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His legs are like weapons.</v>

516
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 5>They're like arms really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He chokes you with his arms and he's </v>

517
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 5>choking you with his legs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

518
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

519
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.200
<v Speaker 5>he has incredible dexterity and </v>
<v Speaker 5>flexibility with his legs and that's </v>

520
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.261
<v Speaker 5>always made bj particularly dangerous on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground and it's just smart about </v>

521
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:36.241
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just is very good at understanding </v>

522
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 5>when to push things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when not to where,</v>

523
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 5>where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

524
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.620
<v Speaker 5>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

525
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 5>just like with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you only fight a lot of tough fighters.</v>

526
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:46.140
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have some losses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

527
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's essentially what happened to Bj.</v>

528
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking rough businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a rough business.</v>

529
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vj still fighting.</v>

533
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.460

<v Speaker 4>He must've started his career in the </v>

534
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 4>early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

536
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time to fight.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I would like to guess he probably </v>

540
00:24:24.641 --> 00:24:25.180
<v Speaker 4>started fighting somewhere around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

541
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 4>let's find out more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go 15 years of scrapping.</v>

542
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot.</v>

543
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.400
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

544
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 4>it's just when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see it live,</v>

545
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:43.661
<v Speaker 4>you understand like really firsthand </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the actual real consequences of </v>

546
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 4>these exchanges are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live for me was just also the,</v>

547
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 4>the excitement around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

548
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an arena with people so jacked up </v>

549
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 4>for a fight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think you've said like nothing in</v>

550
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 4>and of itself is as exciting as a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

551
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 4>like a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fight in any moment is exciting,</v>

552
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.900
<v Speaker 4>but when you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

553
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 4>an arena full cheering with excitement </v>
<v Speaker 4>to add to that,</v>

554
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 4>there's something that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>duplicate.</v>

555
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on an energy level it breaks.</v>

556
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.930
<v Speaker 4>The consequences are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The consequences are high,</v>

557
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 4>but there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an energy in the room,</v>

558
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 4>have somebody walking up and you hearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

559
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that raises the hair on your neck and </v>

560
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh God.</v>

561
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 4>And then with everything that lands that</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheering,</v>

562
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.220
<v Speaker 4>whoa man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

563
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

564
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 4>you can't mimic that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

565
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 4>neon.</v>

567
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate the phrase because we set it for </v>

568
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 4>so long and it's as real as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

569
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 4>But it is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

570
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 4>So you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it about a phrase when you say a</v>

571
00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:48.380
<v Speaker 4>phrase too long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just stop.</v>

572
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Meaning anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People start to miss phrases,</v>

573
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.910
<v Speaker 4>work beats talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When talent refused to work,</v>

574
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 4>hard to write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know that's true,</v>

575
00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 4>but I fucking hate it when people say </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Say it too much anymore.</v>

578
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.980
<v Speaker 4>They hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start.</v>

579
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 4>One's done.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

581
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's certain ones like as real as</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets done.</v>

582

<v Speaker 4>Say you gotta you gotta stop and smell </v>
<v Speaker 4>the roses sometimes to talk about life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What's the forum?</v>

600
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 4>The forum is a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>live on the air.</v>

608
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 4>We could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you want to do it live in front </v>

609
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 4>of a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can do it anywhere.</v>

610
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you want it?</v>

611
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 4>You really guys really want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>live.</v>

612
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

613
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably could do it.</v>

614
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

615
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

616
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.190
<v Speaker 4>we get a couple thousand people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forum.</v>

617
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:24.190
<v Speaker 4>So you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're unaware of if I'll do it.</v>

618
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 4>If we can get a couple of those ring </v>
<v Speaker 4>girls,</v>

619
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 4>but that look way different than those </v>
<v Speaker 4>really big ones.</v>

620
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Real heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real heavy ring girls,</v>

621
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 4>then I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's fat shaming though.</v>

622
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you start using heavy risk thing is </v>

623
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

624
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>You're a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

625
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>You can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

626
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 4>you can take you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd never accused of fat shaming.</v>

627
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 4>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That term is.</v>

628
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm Ronda Rousey who's of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

629
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 4>former UFC bantamweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

630
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 4>All time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great mixed martial artists.</v>

631
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.680
<v Speaker 4>She has this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Julianna Pena that is in her weight </v>

632
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 4>division and they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talk shit to each other or at least</v>

633
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:17.181
<v Speaker 4>Juliana has been talking shit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda Rousey and Ronda Rousey,</v>

634
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 4>which you was saying was that Ronda </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rousey has large arms.</v>

635
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 4>She said she was fat arms.</v>

636
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.590
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the things you're saying,</v>

637
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 4>but just so innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then people were saying that she was fat</v>

638
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 4>shaming or you are you really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

639
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:35.610
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protecting Ronda fucking Rousey.</v>

640
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lady that said it,</v>

641
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 4>that's to her such a horrible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

642
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.980
<v Speaker 4>you know they're going to fight is my </v>
<v Speaker 4>point here,</v>

643
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 4>but she eventually made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

644
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:52.251
<v Speaker 4>I might lose that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have fat ass arms like you do </v>

645
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:53.710
<v Speaker 4>and that to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she always had these awesome arms.</v>

646
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

647
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 4>because I mean somebody to go after </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

648
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.300
<v Speaker 4>like that's for her a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know those,</v>

649
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda doesn't need any,</v>

650
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>any defense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda is really thin,</v>

651
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:11.460
<v Speaker 4>like she's really thin now she's chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

652
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean she's got muscles,</v>

653
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:14.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

654
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 4>She's got some big ass shoulder muscles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and big arm muscles.</v>

655
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.680
<v Speaker 4>This is a reason that not all fat things</v>
<v Speaker 4>are launching chicks through the air.</v>

656
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

657
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.670
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's got plenty of.</v>

658
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.780
<v Speaker 4>But my point was they were proposing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight in a fucking cage and somehow or </v>

659
00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:35.491
<v Speaker 4>another it's just unbelievable outrage </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she made fun of her arms being </v>

660
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:35.491
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

661
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to read each other nearly to</v>

662
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:41.940
<v Speaker 4>death about fat</v>

663
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

664
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you can insult people about their </v>

665
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 1>personality and the fact that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really what it is to.</v>

666
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encourage fat shaming.</v>

667
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's helpful to you for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

668
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely helpful.</v>

669
00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think it's helpful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it depends on your psyche,</v>

670
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

671
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:05.341
<v Speaker 1>how you respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's just like somebody </v>

672
00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:08.311
<v Speaker 1>calling you out on your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a version of that is a </v>

673
00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 1>physical version of that and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you can be in denial,</v>

674
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:15.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are in denial </v>

675
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:15.001
<v Speaker 1>about a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

676
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:15.001
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people just want to live their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives to,</v>

677
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 1>to take cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play devil's advocate,</v>

678
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:21.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just want to live their </v>

679
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:21.241
<v Speaker 1>lives and they don't mind being heavy.</v>

680
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:22.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about something.</v>

681
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

682
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:28.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that person doesn't </v>

683
00:30:28.741 --> 00:30:28.741
<v Speaker 1>have a right to feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

684
00:30:28.741 --> 00:30:30.150
<v Speaker 1>But it's what I think some people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with it is that these,</v>

685
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.190
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that didn't do </v>

686
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.190
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do anything to you.</v>

687
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Everything they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done to themselves.</v>

688
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you shitting on them,</v>

689
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.870
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy.</v>

690
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an easy thing to do.</v>

691
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

692
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't so fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would talk about it.</v>

693
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.840
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

694
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been called fat at so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different points.</v>

695
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been up and down my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I feel,</v>

696
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I think because of that and when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older you have more acceptance with like</v>

697
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Speaker 1>not having a problem with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it.</v>

698
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 1>People that I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a public figure in a lot of ways,</v>

699
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm used to people being like,</v>

700
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go fuck yourself.</v>

701
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I hate your act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

702
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

703
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's another version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

704
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you're fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

705
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cue if you ain't feeling.</v>

706
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the same feeling as I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

707
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so much for that has nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with that.</v>

708
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 1>If somebody throws in fat and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

709
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:25.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just appoint me disappointment.</v>

715
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

716
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you disappoint this fight?</v>

717
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

718
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

719
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:49.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to engage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's bizarre when people do engage </v>

720
00:31:49.861 --> 00:31:49.861
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

721
00:31:49.861 --> 00:31:51.160
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Philip to Franco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had them on the podcast for Super </v>

726
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Nice Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

727
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.330
<v Speaker 1>he was going out with some chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

728
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.910
<v Speaker 1>he tweeted something today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it,</v>

729
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.920
<v Speaker 1>what was his original tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it about Kanye or something like </v>

730
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.840
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about visiting trump.</v>

731
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And he tweeted like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump would tweet.</v>

732
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

733
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>He tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to see trump.</v>

734
00:32:22.511 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Tweet after this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Met with Kanye West.</v>

735
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous American artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shame Jay won't call him.</v>

736
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad,</v>

737
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:32.410
<v Speaker 1>exclamation point because it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking funny.</v>

738
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800
<v Speaker 1>That's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

739
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.810
<v Speaker 1>some woman got really mad and liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wrote Mine Yo Damn White and stay</v>

740
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 5>out of black people's beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You not a part of black twitter.</v>

741
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Stop stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're tweeting style.</v>

742
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 5>And then I went to her page and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a troll.</v>

743
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 5>I think she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's trolling.</v>

744
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to give out her name or </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything like that.</v>

745
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 5>Please don't get anybody excited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she's real.</v>

746
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 5>But maybe it's just felt like shitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>on them too.</v>

747
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.080
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she just felt like tighten it and </v>

748
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 5>didn't think he was going to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he responded in a video.</v>

749
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did love his videos.</v>

750
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Speaker 5>He responded and talked about and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

751
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:15.570
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.170
<v Speaker 2>somebody who disagrees with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>political position will go,</v>

758
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.560

<v Speaker 2>commenting on this.</v>

759
00:33:37.561 --> 00:33:38.130
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>

780
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 5>I have talked to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have.</v>

781
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:28.901
<v Speaker 5>I have had the conversations with people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who think they're Kung Fu master could </v>

782
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:32.890
<v Speaker 5>fight in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's scared of someone dying.</v>

783
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.810
<v Speaker 5>If someone understands real cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real cheap master.</v>

784
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 5>I've had these kinds of conversations </v>
<v Speaker 5>with people.</v>

785
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.740
<v Speaker 2>How much do people believe that Kung Fu </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people still do?</v>

786
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think it would fall on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale of the martial arts?</v>

787
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Ability to win major fights with highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained people in either like where </v>

788
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.700
<v Speaker 2>would Kung Fu fall?</v>

789
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with martial arts with </v>

790
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 5>individual martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ketos obviously at the top.</v>

791
00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:01.140
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is the problem with </v>

792
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.091
<v Speaker 5>individual martial arts like that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're no longer unaware of the </v>

793
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:05.290
<v Speaker 5>tactics and abilities of other martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>

794
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:10.300
<v Speaker 5>so it used to be that if you were like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>taekwondo guy like I was,</v>

795
00:35:10.301 --> 00:35:14.350
<v Speaker 5>you would have a delusional sense of how</v>
<v Speaker 5>good you would do in a fight with a judo</v>

796
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 5>person because you don't because you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>never,</v>

797
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:21.430
<v Speaker 5>never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody grabbed me before and through </v>

798
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.430
<v Speaker 5>your round to really have no idea how </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy it would be for them to do it.</v>

799
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 5>You have a distorted idea in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now everybody knows this guy.</v>

800
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now everybody know.</v>

801
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:28.960
<v Speaker 5>So now it's real hard to say like a Kung</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fu guy.</v>

802
00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:33.961
<v Speaker 5>Like if a Kung Fu guy fought a judo guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>who would win because there's no real </v>

803
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:36.190
<v Speaker 5>only Kung Fu guys anymore and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

804
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.920
<v Speaker 5>Only judo they'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all know about mma.</v>

805
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows if you're a martial </v>

806
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 5>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially your,</v>

807
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get your black belt level or </v>

808
00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:46.821
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're aware of other shit now,</v>

809
00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 5>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what things,</v>

810
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.470
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's more effective now?</v>

811
00:35:50.471 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a better understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it than anyone's ever had before.</v>

812
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:57.891
<v Speaker 5>So if you're like a high level martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists even arrest or something like </v>

813
00:35:57.891 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you they know.</v>

814
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Most of them know something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know how to throw their hands.</v>

815
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:03.380
<v Speaker 5>They know how to throw a kicker too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

816
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 5>and if they got to like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 5>coach,</v>

817
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 5>they could probably get pretty good at </v>
<v Speaker 5>striking.</v>

818
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 5>Pretty fucking quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

819
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 5>But striking is one of those weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

820
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:14.961
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems that it's really difficult to </v>

821
00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:15.150
<v Speaker 5>people for people to get really good at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

822
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 5>If they don't have the right body for it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they start late in life.</v>

823
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 5>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

824
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

825
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get better at it,</v>

826
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:28.490
<v Speaker 5>but there's a certain amount of speed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you need to execute really set up </v>

827
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:33.591
<v Speaker 5>in Knox and buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain amount you can get by </v>

828
00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 5>with a certain amount of speed against </v>
<v Speaker 5>lesser competition.</v>

829
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:40.161
<v Speaker 5>You can get by even more so if you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>more of a threat as a wrestler and you </v>

830
00:36:40.161 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 5>can give by even more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're really smart,</v>

831
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 5>you really understand when to engage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when not to engage and you're threatened</v>

832
00:36:44.251 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 5>with arrest and you can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 5>like having a slower striking style,</v>

833
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 5>but if you can't do those things then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking sitting duck and that's</v>

834
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:56.991
<v Speaker 5>one of the most terrifying aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them I met and the most terrifying </v>

835
00:36:56.991 --> 00:37:00.141
<v Speaker 5>aspects of mma is being stuck in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the cage with a guy like </v>

836
00:37:00.141 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva and his prime.</v>

837
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 5>It was just sliding slightly out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

838
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 5>Your Shit and crack and you in the face </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's dancing around and you know,</v>

839
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 5>he's making the wobbly face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's,</v>

840
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.730
<v Speaker 5>he's rocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

841
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 5>To fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he's kicks you and punches you.</v>

842
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's done some creepy shit to dudes </v>

843
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.280
<v Speaker 5>inside the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean creepy in a way that's like not,</v>

844
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 5>not negative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean so good.</v>

845
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.320
<v Speaker 5>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these moments in fights where you just </v>

846
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.320
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>holy shit,</v>

847
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.390
<v Speaker 5>it's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

848
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:29.490
<v Speaker 5>You got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get stuck in a cage with that dude.</v>

849
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 5>He would just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just basically,</v>

850
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 5>if this was a thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be that he would be the king of</v>

851
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 5>the village like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most likely now.</v>

852
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 5>Well the village will be the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

853
00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:44.350
<v Speaker 5>See that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we're doing is we're separating </v>

854
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:44.350
<v Speaker 5>people by size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

855
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you meet a guy like brock </v>

856
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

857
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.540
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why there's a heavyweight </v>

858
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:50.540
<v Speaker 5>division.</v>

859
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.460
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's a totally different kinds of </v>

860
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.460
<v Speaker 5>human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much,</v>

861
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.790
<v Speaker 5>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many guys like that can actually.</v>

862
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:58.270
<v Speaker 5>And I talking about brock specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that are like two 85 can move like </v>

863
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well No,</v>

864
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.910
<v Speaker 5>they can keep a body like that without </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything additional like.</v>

865
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:07.911
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a super good question and it's </v>

866
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 5>not anonymous question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is people are real dishonest</v>

867
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 5>about what they take in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they don't take.</v>

868
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird because there's people that </v>

869
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.240
<v Speaker 5>argue with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll say that there is only so big a </v>

870
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.790
<v Speaker 5>person can ever get and be so fast </v>
<v Speaker 5>without help.</v>

871
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then he got to say,</v>

872
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 5>but their understanding of recovery is </v>
<v Speaker 5>way better today than ever before.</v>

873
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 5>Like your understanding of like when the</v>
<v Speaker 5>train would not train,</v>

874
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 5>when you're overtrained,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you,</v>

875
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 5>if you're at a real high level place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to like if you're grooming</v>

876
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 5>you to be an nfl player or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

877
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 5>they're going to give you some</v>

878
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Pretty High Level Instruction and </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching.</v>

879
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 4>And if you're eating right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a definitely a jump</v>

880
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 4>over people that were in your same sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of position 20 years ago.</v>

881
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the athletes are going to be better </v>

882
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160
<v Speaker 4>just because of the science of training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

883
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.680
<v Speaker 4>But after that you gotta wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

884
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not like they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>about them.</v>

885
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Now of course they all know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids.</v>

886
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 4>So easy to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they don't know about them</v>

887
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 4>and they not like they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They help.</v>

888
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.780
<v Speaker 4>And these dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of the guys are definitely </v>

889
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.780
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

890
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 4>But some guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so like,</v>

891
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:13.771
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>10.</v>

893
00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some of them honestly are </v>

894
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.270
<v Speaker 4>probably a bit big on purpose to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lineman,</v>

895
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to meet them.</v>

896
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.580

<v Speaker 4>I know nothing about football.</v>

901
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:34.150

<v Speaker 4>each other real well and they actually </v>

933
00:40:58.801 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 4>liked each other a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they fucking went,</v>

934
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 4>had it.</v>

935
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.070
<v Speaker 4>They just both went at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changed the game.</v>

936
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Both guys fought Anderson Silva to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

937
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Later in their career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they both,</v>

938
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.050
<v Speaker 4>they both got fucked up now was when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they understand was just a jet.</v>

939
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 4>I night he was just doing shit to people</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the octagon where you're like,</v>

940
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How was that the um,</v>

941
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.340
<v Speaker 4>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one fight with him.</v>

942
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think was it the Weidman One?</v>

943
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he broke his leg or when the,</v>

944
00:41:27.721 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get knocked out.</v>

945
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 4>I think when he got knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>

946
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.230
<v Speaker 4>And you've been to a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into a bunch of them now.</v>

947
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.910
<v Speaker 4>That one was crazy because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>winning that fight.</v>

948
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't go to that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely saw.</v>

949
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I've seen both those guys fight at </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights,</v>

950
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 4>so I can't remember if I saw that fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

951
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Weidman was pressing him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Anderson was kicking them a lot in </v>

952
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.020
<v Speaker 4>the legs.</v>

953
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was looking at,</v>

954
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

955
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 4>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's kicking his legs a lot.</v>

956
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.190
<v Speaker 4>I hear a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like crazy taunting.</v>

957
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.060
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weidman did something really slick.</v>

958
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 4>He did something really slick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

959
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:05.050
<v Speaker 4>He threw a back fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He threw a punch and then he threw a </v>

960
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 4>back fist because they understand what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

961
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.300
<v Speaker 4>He was bobbing and weaving and bobbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and weaving,</v>

962
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 4>like moving away from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he figures if the rights come and </v>

963
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 4>then the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he throws a punch.</v>

964
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:17.531
<v Speaker 4>Mrs then throws it back fist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which makes Anderson have to go that </v>

965
00:42:17.531 --> 00:42:17.531
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

966
00:42:17.531 --> 00:42:21.460
<v Speaker 4>So then when he starts going that way </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other way and catches him with a </v>

967
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:21.460
<v Speaker 4>left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

968
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful combination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful combination with the </v>

969
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.461
<v Speaker 4>guy moves his head a lot because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>force them because you're not just </v>

970
00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 4>throwing one in that direction.</v>

971
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 4>You throw in a second one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's going that way,</v>

972
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.180
<v Speaker 4>which is like when you throw a left </v>
<v Speaker 4>hook,</v>

973
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.510
<v Speaker 4>he's going that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's already going the way to avoid </v>

974
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.271
<v Speaker 4>the left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to come back and when it comes </v>

975
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:43.271
<v Speaker 4>to when it comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

976
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:43.271
<v Speaker 4>He catches him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

977
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's brilliant.</v>

978
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 4>You had a full time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the setup before the fucking blow </v>

979
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked a little slower than Anderson,</v>

980
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:55.751
<v Speaker 4>so he was having a hard time catching </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and they understand was staying on </v>

981
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 4>the outside and kicking his legs a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had collided in the first round</v>

982
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.860
<v Speaker 4>and he took anderson down and wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of his legs up and had them pretty </v>

983
00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.221
<v Speaker 4>tight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be getting a leg lock or </v>

984
00:43:06.221 --> 00:43:06.221
<v Speaker 4>attempting to leg lock and Anderson got </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>

985
00:43:06.221 --> 00:43:07.250
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that different to where at the.</v>

986
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.460
<v Speaker 4>After the fight we're Weidman was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make your decision now you're either on </v>

987
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.670
<v Speaker 4>board or you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there was no,</v>

988
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:15.590
<v Speaker 4>that was another fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another fight.</v>

989
00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was,</v>

990
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:21.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was after Vittorio sick.</v>

991
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 4>After he beat up beat tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

992
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 4>pick your title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

993
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.480
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

994
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

995
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Damn Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've had up to now to decide.</v>

996
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

997
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an interesting guy.</v>

998
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.690
<v Speaker 4>He takes a loss like a fucking champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that he lost to Yoel </v>

999
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Romero by knockout and the new sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the das entering questions later with</v>

1000
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 4>this aisle stitched up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know what I mean?</v>

1001
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.280
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1002
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.530
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1003
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.190
<v Speaker 4>he's a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't fight.</v>

1004
00:43:48.191 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 4>I was hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1005
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

1006

<v Speaker 4>And then just answer,</v>

1007
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:54.680
<v Speaker 4>answer questions with stitches over your</v>
<v Speaker 4>eye and you're talking to press people.</v>

1008
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some guys real fucked up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect composure though.</v>

1009
00:43:57.591 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 4>You handled it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was at that Gustafson,</v>

1010
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones fight where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they both went to the hospital.</v>

1011
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] brutal Dan Rudel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brutal fight.</v>

1012
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 4>It was a decision find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1013
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1014
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Then it was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they just massacred each other,</v>

1015
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just beat the shit out of each </v>

1016
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:20.560
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a crazy fight.</v>

1017
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does a fight where John was talking </v>

1018
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.891
<v Speaker 4>about it when he was on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about how much partied </v>

1019
00:44:26.891 --> 00:44:28.250
<v Speaker 4>after that fight for the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Partying a lot.</v>

1020
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 4>It was an incredible fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remember</v>

1022
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 1>how bloodied those guys were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a rough fight and gustafson </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked.</v>

1024
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crowd.</v>

1025
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>You could feel the crowd swell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I always call mma,</v>

1026
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>this is the phrase I use all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it'll start getting annoying </v>

1027
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.301
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like extreme problem solving with </v>

1028
00:44:50.301 --> 00:44:54.140
<v Speaker 1>dire physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a plus shit-talking </v>

1029
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throwing that to stakes.</v>

1030
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Talking Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:02.571
<v Speaker 1>high stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an emotional battle whether or </v>

1032
00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:03.260
<v Speaker 1>not you can keep your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will you handle pressure this giant.</v>

1033
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 1>The thing about conor mcgregor more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1034
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1035
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:13.610
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't do more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of many things about them </v>

1036
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:13.610
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1037
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the most interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him as he handles pressure,</v>

1038
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:17.270
<v Speaker 1>like nobody I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Like when he fought Aldo for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even look remotely nervous.</v>

1040
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 1>He was super relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super calm.</v>

1041
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>But then you started to think though </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you go,</v>

1042
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.560
<v Speaker 1>how much of what you're seeing is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure is manifested through that guy.</v>

1043
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

1044
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the press conference kind of antics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1045
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that genuine?</v>

1046
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that an act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how he handles the pressure of </v>

1047
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 1>this high pressure situation by doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

1048
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

1049
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Bang show at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it.</v>

1050
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.500
<v Speaker 1>But I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find the guy,</v>

1051
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you want,</v>

1052
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:58.050
<v Speaker 1>why someone becomes a star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a endlessly entertaining on top of being</v>

1053
00:45:58.051 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1054
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tuning into,</v>

1055
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the fucking show.</v>

1056
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.070
<v Speaker 5>He's the best shit talker of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1057
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.080
<v Speaker 5>I've said that before about other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>before that I said Chael Sonnen was the </v>

1058
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.380
<v Speaker 5>best shit talker of all time and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was for awhile,</v>

1059
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.550
<v Speaker 5>but I think connor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connor,</v>

1060
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.730
<v Speaker 5>them and also sudden all also as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor has an additional significance to</v>

1061
00:46:18.011 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 5>a shit talking because he knocked people</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>

1062
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a totally different thing.</v>

1063
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:27.501
<v Speaker 5>And Chael Sonnen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that he's not a fucking animal </v>

1064
00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:27.501
<v Speaker 5>because Chael Sonnen is an animal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's.</v>

1065
00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:31.380
<v Speaker 5>He's submitted Shogun who a shell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simon's a very solid grappler came very </v>

1066
00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 5>close to beating Anderson Silva in their</v>
<v Speaker 5>first fight.</v>

1067
00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:38.350
<v Speaker 5>So He's a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what connor does differently is the </v>

1068
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:42.170
<v Speaker 5>isis guys with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a big factor in the fight </v>

1069
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.921
<v Speaker 5>when you're watching him and he fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Alvarez and all of a sudden he </v>

1070
00:46:45.921 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 5>things and with the lefthand and catches</v>
<v Speaker 5>them in some early on you go holy Shit.</v>

1071
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 5>And they realize like he's fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy now at 155 pounds and Eddie Alvarez </v>

1072
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 5>a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>55.</v>

1073
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 5>He's a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big muscular guy.</v>

1074
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 5>The idea is he's going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestle connor.</v>

1075
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be able to grab them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>grind them out the same way you did with</v>

1076
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Pettis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1077
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dealing with a totally different animal.</v>

1078
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.280
<v Speaker 5>Connor's just got a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of focus as far as like the way </v>

1079
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 5>zooms in on targets and his precision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just speed.</v>

1080
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:17.910
<v Speaker 5>He's just dropping it in there with 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent speed.</v>

1081
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.770
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a big part of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

1082
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:24.771
<v Speaker 5>He's not loading up at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the ability to stay calm when you </v>

1083
00:47:24.771 --> 00:47:27.861
<v Speaker 5>load up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say like if you see someone coming at </v>

1084
00:47:27.861 --> 00:47:29.991
<v Speaker 5>you and you just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that's wasted time that's wasted </v>

1085
00:47:29.991 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 5>time with connor has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the ability to be perfectly technical</v>

1086
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 5>in a firefight.</v>

1087
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:36.260
<v Speaker 5>So like all those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 5>Charging Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like 13 seconds into the fight.</v>

1089
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.520
<v Speaker 5>All those charge and Adam and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to just slide back and blam drops </v>

1090
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 5>that lefthanded in on it is a striking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the strongest part of his.</v>

1091
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1092
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:51.690
<v Speaker 5>His ground game is underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's very good on the ground.</v>

1093
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.570
<v Speaker 5>It was very good defensively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a good sweep sweep.</v>

1094
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.710
<v Speaker 5>Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their first pipe.</v>

1095
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 5>People forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the kind of guy.</v>

1096
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 5>How much would you love to watch before </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a professional?</v>

1097
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Speaker 5>I did watch them before know bar fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1098
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1099
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:06.990
<v Speaker 5>he's been in some definite scraps in </v>
<v Speaker 5>bars,</v>

1100
00:48:06.991 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1101
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 5>get 18 in Ireland if you haven't been in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bar fight.</v>

1102
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going out tonight loud,</v>

1103
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 5>chatty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably the worst accident ever.</v>

1104
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Probably right up there.</v>

1105
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw him fight in a cage warriors.</v>

1106
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:28.830
<v Speaker 5>I tweeted to him in like 2013 before he </v>
<v Speaker 5>came to the UFC.</v>

1107
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan man.</v>

1108
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.510
<v Speaker 5>Want you to come over and diddy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1109
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1110
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:35.600
<v Speaker 5>right after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1111
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.360
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC in him.</v>

1112
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.240
<v Speaker 5>Totally coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't cry.</v>

1113
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:44.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely probably told anybody </v>

1114
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:44.310
<v Speaker 5>listened to me about them because I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen him fight before.</v>

1115
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:44.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid.</v>

1116
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.360
<v Speaker 5>Isis people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 5>His left hand is just devastating and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a crazy style.</v>

1118
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 5>He fights in his like wide stance and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>moves different and he cracks guys.</v>

1119
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid's legit.</v>

1120
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to see them in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never asked you.</v>

1121
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1122
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 5>that's January of 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was almost four years ago.</v>

1123
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you think,</v>

1124
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never talked to you about what did you</v>

1125
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Speaker 5>think of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1126
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:15.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the talks of a him floyd mayweather </v>

1127
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:15.560
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

1128
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.060
<v Speaker 5>We'll fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you he would fight if you </v>

1129
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.871
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of match do you think that </v>

1130
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:21.871
<v Speaker 5>he's a lot bigger than floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1131
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:23.080
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just emphasize that.</v>

1132
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a lot bigger,</v>

1133
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.700
<v Speaker 5>so it'd be a real problem as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 5>weight cutting because if they were </v>

1134
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 5>layla conor fight at wherever he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor's going away somewhere around 170</v>

1135
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:33.890
<v Speaker 5>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1136
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.960
<v Speaker 5>That's where he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His best like in is optima with no </v>

1137
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:38.960
<v Speaker 5>weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Floyd's that big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think floyd,</v>

1139
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you he's probably not more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than one 60.</v>

1140
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 5>Do you think floyd's bigger than one </v>
<v Speaker 5>slash 16.</v>

1141
00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 5>Real life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Small Dude.</v>

1142
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 5>He's a small guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1143
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.960
<v Speaker 5>he's really short.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean wait,</v>

1144
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 5>but he's small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What weight did he begin?</v>

1145
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 5>His career at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Floyd mayweather is mean.</v>

1146
00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm a huge flood bay with her fence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that when it comes to boxing,</v>

1147
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.700
<v Speaker 5>I think he's like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>skillful boxers that's ever lived.</v>

1148
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I really do technical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not the most 1:50.</v>

1149
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's probably what he last fought at.</v>

1150
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:16.411
<v Speaker 5>Like didn't he make 'em when he met?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he fought Canelo didn't you make </v>

1151
00:50:16.411 --> 00:50:17.840
<v Speaker 5>him come down a bit and made him come </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to like 1:54</v>

1152
00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:19.420
<v Speaker 5>or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds right.</v>

1153
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:25.050
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought they had some sort of a catch </v>

1154
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.530
<v Speaker 5>weight fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember Canelo's fight.</v>

1155
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's finding</v>

1156
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 4>one 60 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's definitely bigger.</v>

1157
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Or is he fighting at 1:54?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gennady Golovkin is one 60,</v>

1158
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:38.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the hold up is the two of them </v>

1159
00:50:38.981 --> 00:50:39.430
<v Speaker 4>because I think I feel like Canelo has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been fighting midway too.</v>

1160
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Like he fought cotto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that?</v>

1161
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't that at middleweight or </v>
<v Speaker 4>1:54.</v>

1162
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Alvarez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alvarez catch weight 1:50</v>

1163
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.210
<v Speaker 4>1:52.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1164
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he made canelo loose some weight.</v>

1165
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.080
<v Speaker 4>He just Canelo is a lot bigger than him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.750
<v Speaker 4>So canal probably walks around maybe 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds heavier than that.</v>

1167
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad motherfucker too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's good.</v>

1168
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>

1169
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 4>that just boxed him up yet what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's there.</v>

1170
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm hearing plot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh look at that.</v>

1171
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Just beautiful technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing you have to wonder </v>

1172
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:13.840
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1173
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like connor's skills,</v>

1174
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 4>technical skills match up to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the counter counter defense,</v>

1175
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:26.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine they would unless </v>

1176
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:26.340
<v Speaker 4>mayweather.</v>

1177
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:26.340
<v Speaker 4>So out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm staying on top of his game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him on top of his game.</v>

1179
00:51:30.231 --> 00:51:32.490
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to know.</v>

1180
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have to be really top level </v>
<v Speaker 4>to catch him.</v>

1181
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.010
<v Speaker 4>It's so nuts at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dude is so fast that he,</v>

1182
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 4>he box it like something nobody has done</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his lead hand down.</v>

1183
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.860
<v Speaker 4>Not even hip level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mid Thigh Times.</v>

1184
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that forces his shoulder over.</v>

1185
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.670
<v Speaker 4>It's actually an easier way to block a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of things if you're skillful with </v>

1186
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.750
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got shoulder roll.</v>

1187
00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to be.</v>

1188
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not just quick and he's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>

1189
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what floyd has over like almost </v>

1190
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Speaker 4>anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he's got this incredible </v>

1191
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you do it.</v>

1192
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Like he knows so much about boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about boxing as a science from his </v>

1193
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.660
<v Speaker 4>brother or his father rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his uncle,</v>

1194
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:22.150
<v Speaker 4>his uncle's roger made,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was a black Mamba who was an </v>

1195
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 4>all time fucking exciting guy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like the eighties and nineties,</v>

1196
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 4>he would starch people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man</v>

1197
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 2>sued him on those Hbo shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never had a better comedy than </v>

1198
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Roger May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether moments.</v>

1199
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.900
<v Speaker 2>It's the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1200
00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you mean in between corners?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1201
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:38.670
<v Speaker 2>when they used to do the 24 slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 slash seven,</v>

1202
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 2>he would fucking massacre those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the funniest shit I've ever seen.</v>

1203
00:52:45.241 --> 00:52:48.120
<v Speaker 2>And they edited it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking funny.</v>

1204
00:52:48.121 --> 00:52:53.121
<v Speaker 2>One of those fights they were fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was Alvarez or somebody and I </v>

1205
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:57.030
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to prepare for Florida and </v>

1206
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.930
<v Speaker 2>watch his fights and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just,</v>

1207
00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm just going to have the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life,</v>

1208
00:52:59.461 --> 00:53:01.900
<v Speaker 2>in my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they cut to Roy or to,</v>

1209
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 2>to Roger May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether he goes,</v>

1210
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is Albert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was pretending he doesn't even </v>

1211
00:53:09.301 --> 00:53:13.080
<v Speaker 2>know who the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that really was,</v>

1212
00:53:13.081 --> 00:53:18.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was a big part of the </v>

1213
00:53:18.081 --> 00:53:18.081
<v Speaker 2>preparation for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it in the end it was,</v>

1214
00:53:18.081 --> 00:53:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but for a long time when they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1215
00:53:19.561 --> 00:53:21.810
<v Speaker 2>how are you preparing for this fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1216
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>his answer and they're legit answer was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have to prepare for this</v>

1217
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.130
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 4>We're not preparing for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He better prepare a lot,</v>

1219
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how they would approach it.</v>

1220
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not studying you.</v>

1221
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 4>You need to study this shit right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's going to be bad.</v>

1222
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.970
<v Speaker 4>What happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1223
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good point.</v>

1224
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Floyd's an interesting guy.</v>

1225
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 4>He's had his hands broken a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is.</v>

1227
00:53:45.561 --> 00:53:49.460
<v Speaker 4>There's been rumors about fights that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>must have had a broken hand in.</v>

1228
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has had hands that were broken and </v>

1229
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 4>he's still boxed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that feel like?</v>

1230
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 4>As soon as got a winner's mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

00:53:57.931 --> 00:54:02.931

<v Speaker 4>that guy because it's fun to talk shit </v>

1232
00:54:02.931 --> 00:54:02.931
<v Speaker 4>about him because you've created this </v>
<v Speaker 4>persona.</v>

1233
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's brilliant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a brilliant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he did is brilliant.</v>

1235
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 4>He created like someone to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so talented.</v>

1236
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 4>You can't be them and you're buying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay per view,</v>

1237
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:15.200
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hoping that it.</v>

1238
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're hoping Canelo can catch them.</v>

1240
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 4>They're hooking pack yogurt up everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>villain.</v>

1242
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Keep going down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every fucking guy he's fought.</v>

1243
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Please catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you know you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He had a tough fight with Pacquiao.</v>

1245
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Shuts them down overnight and then he'd </v>

1248
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:47.280

<v Speaker 4>sometimes that persona can just get kind</v>

1249
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 4>of boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smart is it?</v>

1256
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:06.591

1257
00:55:06.591 --> 00:55:06.591
<v Speaker 4>like bricks and money up to his ear </v>

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's rich.</v>

1289
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.840
<v Speaker 4>I think he definitely has money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's made a lot of fucking money,</v>

1290
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 4>that's for damn sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's excellent at what he does for sure.</v>

1291
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 4>Across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also funny.</v>

1293
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.910
<v Speaker 4>He's 49.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He said he hasn't broken rocky </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marciano's record yet.</v>

1296
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.980
<v Speaker 4>He's tied it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting.</v>

1297
00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I wonder if that's on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he doesn't want to break it.</v>

1298
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:05.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's lot people talking shit </v>

1299
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.670
<v Speaker 4>about the pressure of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>

1300
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 4>of it going away is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

1301
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Like as the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1302
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1303
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a good boxing retirement age for</v>

1304
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1305
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 4>do you want to do 50?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1306
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be a meaningful 50.</v>

1307
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 4>You can't reach them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scrub for 50 and then you start to think</v>

1308
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck.</v>

1309
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1310
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 4>if he was gonna Fight Pacquiao again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what kind of.</v>

1311
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm sort of out of the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what kind of numbers pack y'all</v>

1312
00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 4>gets on his fights now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are watching.</v>

1313
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's still the last one I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

1314
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.190
<v Speaker 4>But he just fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did just fight.</v>

1315
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hear any peep about it.</v>

1316
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who was he fighting that?</v>

1317
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why he still does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1318
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.050
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be significant numbers </v>
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1320
00:57:44.741 --> 00:57:47.470

<v Speaker 4>So that's still a big worthwhile fight.</v>

1321
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a big bankroll apparent.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Automatically.</v>

1333
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.710

<v Speaker 4>insane and it was a conor mcgregor card.</v>

1334
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have to think that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest card ever.</v>

1353
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 4>like there's a reason why people buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff,</v>

1354
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.930
<v Speaker 4>but some of it is fucking steroids in it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why it's working.</v>

1355
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 4>And they legit get away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well they just don't tell you what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1357
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Remember weird man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 15 years ago,</v>

1358
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 4>one of the first big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget the product name or I would say</v>

1359
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the big,</v>

1360
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 4>like everyone does this to workout and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to lose weight.</v>

1361
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:36.060
<v Speaker 4>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it had a big commercial,</v>

1362
00:59:36.061 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a successful name for the product</v>

1363
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.020
<v Speaker 4>and then people just started to drop </v>
<v Speaker 4>would die and it wouldn't become like </v>

1364
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 4>many years ago you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about 15 to 20.</v>

1365
00:59:47.061 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 4>She talking about rip fuel one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] right?</v>

1366
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I pedron rather federal,</v>

1367
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 4>federal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then people were.</v>

1368
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was taking them 20 some </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago as a 20th day.</v>

1369
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1370
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 4>but then somebody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1371
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 4>you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're taking speed.</v>

1372
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>

1373
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:12.260
<v Speaker 4>And it took a while to process that </v>
<v Speaker 4>really was one of the key components of </v>

1374
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.680
<v Speaker 4>what you were taking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're taking drugs right now,</v>

1375
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe taking speed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're taking speed and you could </v>

1376
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 4>feel yourself get geeked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1377
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:24.140

1378
01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.441
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu class once when I was like a white</v>
<v Speaker 4>belt and almost had a fucking heart </v>

1379
01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:26.441
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>

1380
01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 4>The heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1381

<v Speaker 4>I sit down.</v>

1382
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did I do?</v>

1383
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was young.</v>

1384
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.790

<v Speaker 4>wasn't like.</v>

1385
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean I knew what it felt like to roll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1386
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:40.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1387
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.560
<v Speaker 4>when you take those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1388
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:44.790
<v Speaker 4>I knew something was totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 4>So like I had been exhausted before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what that felt like.</v>

1390
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got exhausted way too quick.</v>

1391
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.380
<v Speaker 4>My heart was about to explode in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking chest.</v>

1392
01:00:52.381 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1393
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:58.271
<v Speaker 4>I got to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even being like whatever I was 30 </v>

1394
01:00:58.271 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>29 or something like that.</v>

1395
01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 4>I still was smart enough to realize this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a stupid idea and I got to sit down.</v>

1396
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:08.130
<v Speaker 4>Back then I was really dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took a minute before high school </v>

1397
01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:08.130
<v Speaker 4>football game.</v>

1398
01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is that we had the </v>

1399
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 4>conversation before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1400
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 4>you're going to fuck people up because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>

1401
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 4>so you have the illusion of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1402
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe that would work though with </v>
<v Speaker 4>football,</v>

1403
01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:23.141
<v Speaker 4>because football is not something you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would do where you struggle for long </v>

1404
01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:24.060
<v Speaker 4>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get like,</v>

1405
01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.320
<v Speaker 4>it's like five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

1406
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 4>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Jitsu gets super exhausting.</v>

1407
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.280
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like say if you have a sparring </v>

1408
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:33.280
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might be seven minutes long.</v>

1409
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes people do nine minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1410
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:40.451
<v Speaker 4>that sounds really seven minutes was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty standard and so we'd set a timer </v>

1411
01:01:40.451 --> 01:01:44.470
<v Speaker 4>for seven minutes and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically just going at it with someone </v>

1412
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 4>who is probably pretty fucking skillful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.230
<v Speaker 4>You're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:53.231
<v Speaker 4>You feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I felt like my heart was literally </v>

1415
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:53.231
<v Speaker 4>gonna Explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like something's wrong.</v>

1416
01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1417
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.630
<v Speaker 4>we're going away too fast right now for </v>
<v Speaker 4>no fucking reason.</v>

1418
01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.020
<v Speaker 4>Like man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to sit down and my heart wouldn't </v>

1419
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.020
<v Speaker 4>start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't slow down.</v>

1420
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like normally when you work out you have</v>

1421
01:02:03.141 --> 01:02:08.141
<v Speaker 4>like safety run up a hill and you put </v>
<v Speaker 4>your fingers on your pulse and you can </v>

1422
01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.410
<v Speaker 4>sit there and then a few seconds you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel him start to drop and you look down</v>

1423
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 4>at your watch and when you get to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>1:40</v>

1424
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.180
<v Speaker 4>ish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just start sprinting again.</v>

1425
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:19.270
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what most people like to share </v>

1426
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.270
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing like interval </v>
<v Speaker 4>workouts.</v>

1427
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I knew I was way over that and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming down.</v>

1428
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not slowing down.</v>

1429
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Like this is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you knew that's what you took.</v>

1430
01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I know I took a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1431
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking retard.</v>

1432
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm such an extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it says like take two.</v>

1433
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's too for pussies.</v>

1434
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 4>So take for stupid man because you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:46.881
<v Speaker 4>Well it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like doing the competitive martial arts </v>

1436
01:02:46.881 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 4>thing when I was young made me like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense extremist.</v>

1437
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like A.</v>

1438
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's running two miles.</v>

1439
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:52.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm running five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1440
01:02:52.491 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 4>everybody's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing more,</v>

1441
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.370
<v Speaker 4>or is that how you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1442
01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 4>There's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to beat people,</v>

1443
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.020
<v Speaker 4>you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to work harder than them.</v>

1444
01:03:00.021 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you can't just rely on what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're smarter than them.</v>

1445
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 4>How do you know you're smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

1446
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:06.600
<v Speaker 4>They're probably pretty fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you're tougher than them?</v>

1447
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 4>They're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No fucking black belts.</v>

1448
01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:10.380
<v Speaker 4>They're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like don't be stupid.</v>

1449
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Like my thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so highly of yourself that</v>

1450
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to outwork everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1451
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.140
<v Speaker 4>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1452
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 4>That's a good philosophy and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>take days off.</v>

1453
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Days off if you're hurt or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sore.</v>

1454
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 4>He can't fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking off is bad for your brain.</v>

1455
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're competing or you're trying to </v>

1456
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.421
<v Speaker 4>go for something like physically fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with fucking off is that it </v>

1457
01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:39.741
<v Speaker 4>messes with your momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that it messes with your </v>

1458
01:03:39.741 --> 01:03:40.260
<v Speaker 4>skills because sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately go,</v>

1459
01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My body needs a break yet,</v>

1460
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:47.330
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body needs a break so you make a </v>

1461
01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:47.330
<v Speaker 4>conscious decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you were supposed to work out,</v>

1462
01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 4>you know you should work out and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck off.</v>

1463
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.010
<v Speaker 4>You're just like your opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself slips.</v>

1464
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has.</v>

1465
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.570
<v Speaker 4>It has an effect that goes out beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>just that workout.</v>

1466
01:03:57.571 --> 01:03:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It fucks with your confidence because it</v>

1467
01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 4>fucks with your conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why taking care of,</v>

1468
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 4>of little things can bleed into taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of.</v>

1469
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:12.410
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you go like pick up and clean </v>

1470
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.410
<v Speaker 4>up your room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1471
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 4>car you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I feel good about the way this </v>

1472
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 4>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that translate.</v>

1473
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go work out today and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to write.</v>

1474
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those things kind of line up </v>

1475
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1476

1480
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:38.330
<v Speaker 4>because it's just so interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach or the approach to combat and </v>

1481
01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:41.990
<v Speaker 4>everyday life should be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1501
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what</v>

1502
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.410
<v Speaker 4>are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1503
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:36.510
<v Speaker 4>What is wrong with you and your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1504
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:41.760
<v Speaker 4>you're both fucking hilarious chisels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but specific.</v>

1505
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the.</v>

1506
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
<v Speaker 4>You guys have the funniest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>silliest fucking show because you're </v>

1507
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.331
<v Speaker 4>both so specific things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that you just decide like </v>

1508
01:05:51.331 --> 01:05:55.321
<v Speaker 4>you're wearing a shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom's wearing a shirt that says just </v>

1509
01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:57.241
<v Speaker 4>glass and on it now glass is a term that</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters used when they get up on a ridge</v>

1510
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:59.380
<v Speaker 4>and they look for things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I saw that,</v>

1511
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's weird.</v>

1512
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:05.251
<v Speaker 4>Like what did you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you bought that convenience store </v>

1513
01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 4>when we were in Alaska or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1514
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:10.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This would be a silly gimmicky shirt </v>

1515
01:06:10.861 --> 01:06:10.861
<v Speaker 4>toy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1516
01:06:10.861 --> 01:06:10.861
<v Speaker 4>this is a shirt like from your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

1517
01:06:10.861 --> 01:06:11.200
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1518
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a tell the story because every week</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get submitted hundreds of emails with</v>

1519
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 4>links to videos like that.</v>

1520
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1521
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many emails.</v>

1522
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the and the.</v>

1523
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 4>And the Internet is endless pool of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff to pull from.</v>

1524
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 4>And then we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our producer blue band,</v>

1525
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our producer's name.</v>

1526
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 4>The band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1527
01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 4>because it used to be red band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a yellow band for awhile and </v>

1528
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 4>now there's blue band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1529
01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.980
<v Speaker 4>so blue band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we'll go through a lot of this </v>

1530
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.971
<v Speaker 4>stuff and edit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say like a five minute youtube </v>

1531
01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:52.411
<v Speaker 4>video until like maybe six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 to 15 second clips.</v>

1532
01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.050
<v Speaker 4>So we're just always looking at stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1533
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1534
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:56.640
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1535
01:06:56.670 --> 01:07:00.340
<v Speaker 4>a range of things are engaging to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we got this hunter,</v>

1536
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.230
<v Speaker 4>his name is Fred Eichler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's an avid bowhunter.</v>

1537
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 4>He bumped he bonds with a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 4>bow,</v>

1538
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 4>like a recurve bow.</v>

1539
01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one of the most prominent,</v>

1540
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 4>a recurve bow hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's either a recurve bow or it might be</v>

1541
01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 4>a stick bow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the difference between a recurve</v>

1542
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:21.520
<v Speaker 4>bow versus what you power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power accuracy,</v>

1543
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 4>efficiency technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yours is more modern.</v>

1544
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in his side feel there's like a feel</v>

1545
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 4>and if you get really good with one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things,</v>

1546
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.020
<v Speaker 4>it becomes apparently very addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot because,</v>

1547
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people who like recurves,</v>

1548
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 4>they like shooting at targets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an instinctive thing.</v>

1549
01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to shoot a bunch of arrows </v>

1550
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 4>to kind of know where the Arrow is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he shoot differently too because you</v>

1551
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 4>don't really hold it very long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got,</v>

1552
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 4>you kind of draw it back and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>let it go pretty quickly.</v>

1553
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Whereas a compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea of a compound bows,</v>

1554
01:07:55.181 --> 01:08:00.181
<v Speaker 4>there's an extreme amount of force </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exhibited in the beginning or </v>

1555
01:08:00.181 --> 01:08:01.060
<v Speaker 4>it's expressed through this campaign and</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the limbs.</v>

1556
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.780
<v Speaker 4>But then as a camp turns over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets easier because of leverage.</v>

1557
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:10.170
<v Speaker 4>So I don't remember the resistance </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts when you kind of start at the </v>

1558
01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.261
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's massive resistance and then </v>

1559
01:08:13.261 --> 01:08:15.511
<v Speaker 4>there's a big lead off at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like my boat takes 84 pounds to pull </v>

1560
01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:16.210
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1561
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.230
<v Speaker 5>at the end of it it's easy to hold and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't have it.</v>

1562
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:24.310
<v Speaker 5>What's the different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>His would go hard the whole way is hard </v>

1563
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:24.310
<v Speaker 5>the whole way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>however hard it is,</v>

1564
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:29.211
<v Speaker 5>it's hard the whole way and it actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets more difficult as you pull back </v>

1565
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:29.211
<v Speaker 5>instead of less difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1566
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:32.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's the opposite of a compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the compound bows,</v>

1567
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 5>it's difficult to pull in the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the camp settle in.</v>

1568
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 5>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Cam settle in.</v>

1569
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.030
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just hold it there.</v>

1570
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:44.410
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're waiting on something you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could hold it there because it's just </v>

1571
01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:47.160
<v Speaker 5>super hard to hold one of those stick </v>
<v Speaker 5>bows because you're pulling the end of </v>

1572
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.580
<v Speaker 5>it is as hard as you can get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1573
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:53.590
<v Speaker 5>and it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it pulls back and forth depending upon </v>

1574
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:57.611
<v Speaker 5>like how much pressure you put on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can pull it more if you're stronger </v>

1575
01:08:57.611 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 5>or if you're weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can only get to a certain point.</v>

1576
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like if the train to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this thing,</v>

1577
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.160
<v Speaker 5>well it depends on now most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>no because most of them are fairly weak.</v>

1578
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 5>But like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can make them like really powerful.</v>

1579
01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:13.481
<v Speaker 5>You can make them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you had a recurve bow and </v>

1580
01:09:13.481 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 5>particularly the Mongols apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>according to Dan Carlin,</v>

1581
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:19.541
<v Speaker 5>that hardcore history guy who's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said their bows were 160 pounds to </v>

1582
01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:20.870
<v Speaker 5>pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woo.</v>

1583
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.280
<v Speaker 5>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1584
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:23.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1585
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.920
<v Speaker 5>that's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what you're essentially doing is </v>

1586
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.560
<v Speaker 5>you're doing like an 80 pound push and </v>
<v Speaker 5>an 80 pound pole until the same time.</v>

1587
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:36.350
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot to be able to do that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of times in a row.</v>

1588
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 5>It's way harder than doing that with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>compound bow because a compound,</v>

1589
01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 5>but it's just a little difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then easy.</v>

1590
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 5>And this is who would have these 160 </v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds.</v>

1591
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 5>The Mongols did Mongo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1592
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:49.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 hundreds somewhere around then they,</v>

1593
01:09:49.071 --> 01:09:52.520
<v Speaker 5>that was technology back then because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out what a recurve bows.</v>

1594
01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy bow that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1595
01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:56.410
<v Speaker 5>the way it's designed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you see a recurve,</v>

1596
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 5>both that's not strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even look like it would work.</v>

1597
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're seen what they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw it in this guy's video.</v>

1598
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:09.850
<v Speaker 5>This Fred Eichler guy probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think he had a recurve bow </v>

1600
01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:09.850
<v Speaker 5>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he,</v>

1601
01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 5>I think he shoots with what they call a </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick bow,</v>

1602
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:16.090
<v Speaker 5>which is the most prevalent I think I </v>
<v Speaker 5>read in his bio recurve could be a </v>

1603
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:19.901
<v Speaker 5>recurve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet he's got a bunch of different </v>

1604
01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:19.901
<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 5>White Buffalo recurves that what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoots with.</v>

1606
01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:25.601
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you can show a picture of one </v>

1607
01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:26.640
<v Speaker 5>without the string.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1608
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 5>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so weird looking or you know,</v>

1609
01:10:28.281 --> 01:10:33.281
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just see if you could find a picture of </v>

1610
01:10:33.281 --> 01:10:33.281
<v Speaker 5>the Mongol Bose because those are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first ones.</v>

1611
01:10:33.281 --> 01:10:37.330
<v Speaker 5>I think somewhere in that time of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world was the first ones when </v>

1612
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 5>people had figured out how to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>recurve bow.</v>

1613
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:46.210
<v Speaker 5>See that's what the top ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what looks like without the string and </v>

1614
01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 5>it's going to go back to the shape where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see in the bottom right in the same </v>

1615
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it is.</v>

1616
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.790
<v Speaker 5>So it's totally bent the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So because of that it stores up all this</v>

1617
01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:57.791
<v Speaker 5>extra energy because it's your polling </v>
<v Speaker 5>so far back and it has this tremendous </v>

1618
01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 5>snapping effect when you let go of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>string.</v>

1619
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty dope.</v>

1620
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.330
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>

1621
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:07.910
<v Speaker 5>they are incredibly smart for figuring </v>
<v Speaker 5>this out and then to make them </v>

1622
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 5>unbelievably tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1623
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:10.870
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looks like on the strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 5>And make them so tough that you can pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>it all the way back the other way.</v>

1625
01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 5>Like they had to figure this shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had to use a bunch of different </v>

1626
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 5>materials that comes out with incredible</v>
<v Speaker 5>for us.</v>

1627
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:25.971
<v Speaker 5>That's still not as fast as probably a </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern day compound bow and also not </v>

1629
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 5>that consistent because they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>scales.</v>

1630
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Their arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the arrows are all probably very </v>

1631
01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 5>inconsistent because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're making your own broadheads.</v>

1632
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 5>Some of them might be a little heavier </v>
<v Speaker 5>than others.</v>

1633
01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.340
<v Speaker 5>The factory mass producing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Now they're making arrows that are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>aluminum and carbon fiber cores and they</v>

1635
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:48.200
<v Speaker 5>have like a very like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1636
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:53.230
<v Speaker 5>you buy these arrows from like eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>or one of the top level companies that </v>

1637
01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 5>made arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have like this super high tolerance</v>

1638
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 5>levels for like each,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each,</v>

1639
01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:01.550
<v Speaker 5>each one of the arrows that leaves their</v>
<v Speaker 5>factory there super straight like spin </v>

1640
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 5>him and shit and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's good.</v>

1641
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1642
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:06.500
<v Speaker 5>it's a totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible how that,</v>

1643
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.100
<v Speaker 5>that technology evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:13.110
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of these guys like this</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy you're talking about the glass and </v>

1658
01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.010
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Playing on Youtube,</v>

1659
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.170
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1660
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean the audio is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's incredible,</v>

1662
01:12:47.141 --> 01:12:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but then he starts talking about glass </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and he's like,</v>

1663
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:54.490
<v Speaker 2>we were just coming around meadow glass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and glass and we were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps going.</v>

1666
01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Glass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass,</v>

1667
01:12:57.161 --> 01:12:58.000
<v Speaker 2>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass and glass,</v>

1668
01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:00.670
<v Speaker 2>which is looking through binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we discovered,</v>

1669
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but then we played it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like I would post a picture of </v>

1670
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>myself like I'm about to go on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1671
01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:09.760
<v Speaker 2>are you glassing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1672
01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:11.650
<v Speaker 2>like if you talk to somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do today?</v>

1673
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hung out and they're like glass and </v>

1674
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1675
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 2>So then it morphed into meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1676
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 2>just chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of picked up from there.</v>

1678
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 5>You guys have so many of these though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to ask you.</v>

1679
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:26.961
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the deal with jeans calling </v>

1680
01:13:26.961 --> 01:13:30.760
<v Speaker 5>everybody jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you guys were on that and you </v>

1681
01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:30.760
<v Speaker 5>had explained it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:35.140
<v Speaker 2>The latest thing is with that first we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had an electrician over at the house and</v>

1683
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:38.290
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your call your spouse,</v>

1684
01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like Jane's Dino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what I call her.</v>

1685
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So then she walked down the stairs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1686
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.560
<v Speaker 2>gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you like me to put the heat?</v>

1687
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.590
<v Speaker 2>And we just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We called her jeans,</v>

1688
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:53.080
<v Speaker 2>but then we started going into starbucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ordering our drinks.</v>

1689
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:56.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a stupid thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We told our listeners,</v>

1690
01:13:56.321 --> 01:14:01.321
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do this regularly just to amuse </v>

1691
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:04.261
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we'll call them jeans and then </v>

1692
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:08.280
<v Speaker 2>say thank you mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your I love you mommy at the end and no </v>

1693
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.221
<v Speaker 2>one ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The order happens so fast and it's so </v>

1694
01:14:11.221 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 2>like programs that they never cashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never say like,</v>

1695
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:13.570
<v Speaker 2>what did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when I,</v>

1696
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>when I pull up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to starbucks.</v>

1697
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I get for you?</v>

1698
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:22.330
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a hey jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get an iced coffee,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want a double tall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1701
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 2>That'll be 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 words.</v>

1703
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And then I just pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we told them we did that.</v>

1704
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 2>People sent us videos of them doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hilarious.</v>

1705
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like getting his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking to a bill play place and </v>

1706
01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:40.930
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey mommy,</v>

1707
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what this bill means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy is like,</v>

1708
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that first section,</v>

1709
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>like they don't even address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're calling someone mommy or jeans or</v>

1710
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 2>saying thank you mommy or I love you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mommy.</v>

1711
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1712
01:14:50.771 --> 01:14:52.180
<v Speaker 2>have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just,</v>

1713
01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it speaks more to almost have </v>
<v Speaker 2>preprogrammed customer service becomes,</v>

1714
01:14:56.471 --> 01:15:01.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not even acknowledging that </v>

1715
01:15:01.471 --> 01:15:01.471
<v Speaker 2>you're saying something ridiculous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1716
01:15:01.471 --> 01:15:02.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1717
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

1718
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also like,</v>

1719
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying when someone says </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that to you,</v>

1720
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so scrambled.</v>

1721
01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1722
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Because it doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but started off not making any sense,</v>

1723
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:15.580
<v Speaker 2>but then it picked up and made a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1724
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 2>So clearly you can talk English and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to the end.</v>

1725
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:19.600
<v Speaker 2>He calls you mommy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1844
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a full.</v>

1845
01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1846
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cow right there.</v>

1847
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.150
<v Speaker 3>That was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We came right around this tree.</v>

1848
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Is a cow more significant than a bowl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1849
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:27.980
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless he only had a tag for a cow.</v>

1850
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depends on why.</v>

1851
01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Why he shot a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a,</v>

1852
01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:34.190
<v Speaker 5>not a bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it depends on the unit.</v>

1853
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.520
<v Speaker 5>It depends on how many cows they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus how many bowls they have.</v>

1854
01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:42.521
<v Speaker 5>They might want people to kill cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably want a certain amount of </v>

1855
01:20:42.521 --> 01:20:43.940
<v Speaker 5>cows to be killed a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have weird.</v>

1856
01:20:43.941 --> 01:20:48.941
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who decides that fish and game </v>

1857
01:20:48.941 --> 01:20:48.941
<v Speaker 5>department,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go to the.</v>

1858
01:20:48.941 --> 01:20:49.760
<v Speaker 5>We have too many heads entirely on where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>

1859
01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Depends entirely on what part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world you're in.</v>

1860
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:53.580
<v Speaker 5>And then do you report it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1861
01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You tag a tag.</v>

1862
01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.150
<v Speaker 5>An animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me save you a,</v>

1863
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:59.720
<v Speaker 5>you shoot a moose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Moose.</v>

1864
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.440
<v Speaker 5>This one I shot in British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1865
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

1866
01:21:04.881 --> 01:21:06.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a tag and you take that,</v>

1867
01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:07.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1868
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:09.020
<v Speaker 5>you have to pay for it.</v>

1869
01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.660
<v Speaker 5>And they allot a certain amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1870
01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:12.560
<v Speaker 5>some places they have what's called over</v>
<v Speaker 5>the counter,</v>

1871
01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.920
<v Speaker 5>which means they just have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just kind of open to anybody who </v>

1872
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.670
<v Speaker 5>wants to pay for the hunting fee and pay</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the tag feet to some species.</v>

1873
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.110
<v Speaker 5>Particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you shoot that with.</v>

1874
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.930
<v Speaker 5>That was with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1875
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you glassing before a glass in?</v>

1876
01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was like four solid days of hunting</v>

1877
01:21:30.921 --> 01:21:35.921
<v Speaker 5>with no luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we're literally driving down </v>

1878
01:21:35.921 --> 01:21:39.620
<v Speaker 5>this road and off the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seventy yards away was a moose.</v>

1879
01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.740
<v Speaker 5>It was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happened so fast.</v>

1880
01:21:42.741 --> 01:21:44.510
<v Speaker 5>We stopped the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Moose looked up.</v>

1881
01:21:44.511 --> 01:21:46.510
<v Speaker 5>He didn't know what we were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put a,</v>

1882
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a shell.</v>

1883
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I put a bullet in the chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 5>push the Bolt in,</v>

1884
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:54.210
<v Speaker 5>took the safety off Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Eye.</v>

1885
01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:56.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I have time to lean against anything?</v>

1886
01:21:56.001 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have time to lean against </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1887
01:21:57.410 --> 01:22:02.060
<v Speaker 5>I just held it up freehand because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was only about 65 slash 70 yards away.</v>

1888
01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:03.500
<v Speaker 5>He was really close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so close.</v>

1889
01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:06.800
<v Speaker 5>I knew I could make the shot and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

1890
01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.750
<v Speaker 5>And then down immediately there was done</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

1891
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:12.140
<v Speaker 5>So weird feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1892
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

1893
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do what that guy does,</v>

1894
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:20.210
<v Speaker 5>but I use part of you gets pumped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>party gets excited,</v>

1895
01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.380
<v Speaker 5>but I don't act like that guy seems </v>
<v Speaker 5>really little theatrical.</v>

1896
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:26.060
<v Speaker 5>But I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1897
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:31.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm not him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for him maybe that's just how we </v>

1898
01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:31.100
<v Speaker 5>react to it here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was very excited.</v>

1899
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:36.020
<v Speaker 5>Which I understand it's not easy to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with a bow and arrow.</v>

1901
01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.390
<v Speaker 5>Very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will say.</v>

1902
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:43.420
<v Speaker 5>I do feel this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an anti hunting guy at all to </v>

1903
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.890
<v Speaker 5>like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to watch the um,</v>

1904
01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.290
<v Speaker 5>the animal fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it.</v>

1905
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to watch anything die.</v>

1906
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:55.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm fun and it's one of the problems </v>

1907
01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.701
<v Speaker 5>that we have with eating meat in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>country is that we don't watch the </v>

1908
01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:57.701
<v Speaker 5>animals dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course it totally affects you.</v>

1909
01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:59.050
<v Speaker 5>I went to a slaughterhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wants me to,</v>

1910
01:22:59.051 --> 01:23:00.530
<v Speaker 5>and I was a teenager though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1911
01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:03.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long does stop you from eating meat?</v>

1912
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 5>No few hours at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it still</v>

1913
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.160
<v Speaker 4>was one of those images that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1914
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:13.380
<v Speaker 4>fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We felt fear factor in the slaughter </v>

1915
01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.590
<v Speaker 4>house once and you could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd feel it in the building.</v>

1916
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's just my head.</v>

1917
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't feel like it.</v>

1918
01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 4>It felt like a dull hum of death </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

1919
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:26.221
<v Speaker 4>You were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was almost like an ambient sound </v>

1920
01:23:26.221 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 4>that you could pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the floors,</v>

1921
01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:31.620
<v Speaker 4>we had like rain boots on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk around and there's just like so </v>

1922
01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.430
<v Speaker 4>much fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much blood guts.</v>

1923
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 4>He was like a pieces of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1924
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 4>It makes you really understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you're looking at.</v>

1926
01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 4>They would like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It definitely could deter you.</v>

1927
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean I still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1928
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.040
<v Speaker 4>I was a young teenager and I still liked</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1929
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 4>but I think I definitely would be harder</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I'm older.</v>

1930
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.330
<v Speaker 4>What do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something I've considered,</v>

1931
01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 4>like do you think that if you took kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>at an early age to a slaughterhouse,</v>

1932
01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of them would continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat meat?</v>

1933
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 4>You lose a significant number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1934
01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 4>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:08.980
<v Speaker 4>So children probably shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed to something that horrific,</v>

1936
01:24:08.981 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 4>somewhat argued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1937
01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:14.900
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good argument that maybe </v>

1938
01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.711
<v Speaker 4>children don't need to see an animal get</v>
<v Speaker 4>a piston through its head and getting </v>

1939
01:24:16.711 --> 01:24:18.100
<v Speaker 4>hung up by his ankles and he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But guess what?</v>

1940
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Kids who grow up on farms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they see that shit through kids who grow</v>

1941
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:26.491
<v Speaker 4>up in hunting families.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see that shit and it doesn't seem </v>

1942
01:24:26.491 --> 01:24:28.711
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to bother them that </v>

1943
01:24:28.711 --> 01:24:28.711
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:24:28.711 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I think when kids don't see something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and then they see it,</v>

1945
01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 4>then it really fucks them up.</v>

1946
01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 4>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1947
01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:38.380
<v Speaker 4>when we shot this elk in a to hone ranch</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were taking the Elca part.</v>

1948
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

1949
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:44.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting the quarters off and doing all </v>

1950
01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:44.401
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one guy,</v>

1951
01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:48.120
<v Speaker 4>his wife and his little girl came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch and one thing she said was this </v>

1952
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.920
<v Speaker 4>elk was lying down on the ground dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1953
01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.880
<v Speaker 4>because he's the P.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.580
<v Speaker 4>And she's like two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's a tiny little girl.</v>

1955
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 4>She's probably barely talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1956
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 4>is he sleepy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the mom was like,</v>

1957
01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:03.610
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's dead.</v>

1958
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.960
<v Speaker 4>She told her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1959
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1960
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 4>You can change your perspective if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>do what you do for sure.</v>

1961
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 4>If you kill and eat what you killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that changed your perspective on</v>

1962
01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:15.340
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1963
01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:20.341
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not one of those people that think </v>

1964
01:25:20.341 --> 01:25:20.341
<v Speaker 4>that people have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do.</v>

1965
01:25:20.341 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 4>But it changes you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1966
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:25.890
<v Speaker 4>When you remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you did this and then you used it </v>

1967
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:27.550
<v Speaker 4>to meet for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally different.</v>

1968
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different feel when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat it.</v>

1969
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not one of those people that </v>

1970
01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:34.640
<v Speaker 4>doesn't think you should be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>me to the supermarket.</v>

1971
01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 4>I think you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's,</v>

1972
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.910
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely something weird about</v>
<v Speaker 4>not knowing how that animal died.</v>

1973
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not normal,</v>

1974
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like our,</v>

1975
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:49.290
<v Speaker 4>our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way we formulate ideas a lot of is </v>

1976
01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:51.430
<v Speaker 4>based around experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1977
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:55.480
<v Speaker 4>And the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're eating a piece of meat or</v>

1978
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:58.300
<v Speaker 4>if you're even eating fruits or </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables for that matter,</v>

1979
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:04.170
<v Speaker 4>you will understand that experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>better if you go through the whole </v>

1980
01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're there when the plants are</v>

1981
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 4>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe help water them,</v>

1982
01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 4>maybe pick them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe cut them up and serve them,</v>

1983
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 4>and then you're eating them.</v>

1984
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Having a garden is fucking cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cool thing.</v>

1985
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:19.050
<v Speaker 4>It gives you some weird thankfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is one of the things </v>

1986
01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:22.931
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem with people today is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that things come so easy to us that we </v>

1987
01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:27.401
<v Speaker 4>don't have obstacles to overcome and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not super thankful for the super </v>

1988
01:26:27.401 --> 01:26:28.690
<v Speaker 4>easy life that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

1989
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 4>We think of it as being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1990
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:31.490
<v Speaker 4>it's just what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1991
01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Traveling somewhere poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll give you a perspective on that for</v>

1992
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:34.940
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1993
01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:36.200
<v Speaker 4>I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Go into like a really poor place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

1995
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.420
<v Speaker 4>you'll definitely rethink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1996
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling over the waiter.</v>

1997
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was it that was telling us.</v>

1998
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was it that was telling us that they</v>

1999
01:26:47.061 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 4>landed in the Congo and they were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Was that Tom?</v>

2002

<v Speaker 4>fifth of his nephew.</v>

2044
01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever talk to him about sourdough </v>
<v Speaker 4>bread?</v>

2045
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Sourdough bread?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He'll judge your bread.</v>

2049
01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.840

<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>

2050
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Good try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But really what's wrong?</v>

2051
01:28:50.411 --> 01:28:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I love that quality.</v>

2052
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.740
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's so much that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>comics,</v>

2053
01:28:56.741 --> 01:28:59.500
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my favorite attributes about</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians.</v>

2054
01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 4>Are you like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is a fucking hockey fanatic.</v>

2055
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

2056
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>will punch you in the face if you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2057
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they have their little fanaticism.</v>

2058
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's his bread.</v>

2061
01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.290
<v Speaker 9>Any better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>My God.</v>

2062
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:17.150
<v Speaker 9>What am I in France?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Am I in a bakery?</v>

2063
01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.720
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm just baking bread.</v>

2064
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

2065
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.520
<v Speaker 1>That looks really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bread looks fucking sensational.</v>

2066
01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one time I learned,</v>

2067
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I went to a French cooking class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few,</v>

2068
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>like six slash seven years ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned a very basic,</v>

2069
01:29:37.231 --> 01:29:42.231
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more sophisticated way to make </v>

2070
01:29:42.231 --> 01:29:42.360
<v Speaker 1>chocolate souffle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2071
01:29:42.361 --> 01:29:47.361
<v Speaker 1>like the hot lava where you crack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain way you have to learn </v>

2072
01:29:47.361 --> 01:29:50.421
<v Speaker 1>the temperature of your oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the real way it works is to make </v>

2073
01:29:50.421 --> 01:29:54.501
<v Speaker 1>multiples because it might say $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it cooks it in 17 minutes.</v>

2074
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 1>But at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 cooks it in 22 minutes.</v>

2075
01:29:58.201 --> 01:29:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

2076
01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:04.150
<v Speaker 1>because because they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ovens will actually are </v>

2077
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 1>performing at a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not necessarily what it says.</v>

2078
01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would learn how to mix and seasoned </v>

2079
01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:12.650
<v Speaker 1>the Ram Ramekins what's the range you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can error in?</v>

2080
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

2081
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think most people would agree that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want the souffle to have a crack.</v>

2082
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:21.690
<v Speaker 1>You almost want it to be a crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it breaks through the top.</v>

2083
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the middle stays a,</v>

2084
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:29.510
<v Speaker 1>a sort of three quarters type of ooze </v>
<v Speaker 1>softness,</v>

2085
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want it to bake fully </v>

2086
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.270
<v Speaker 1>because then you have a cake basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2087
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:36.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you go under the,</v>

2088
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:37.120
<v Speaker 1>it could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2089
01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you went like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of down the middle.</v>

2090
01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing.</v>

2091
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Do know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Bert crushers,</v>

2092
01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.640
<v Speaker 1>gonna hear this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to hear this souffle talk </v>

2093
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:47.640
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to go off like a rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2094
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

2095
01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you would use my </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts like that.</v>

2096
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I would never do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he just did.</v>

2097
01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:53.470
<v Speaker 1>He had never done this before.</v>

2098
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:56.530
<v Speaker 1>You've never had the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking chocolate souffle now.</v>

2099
01:30:56.690 --> 01:31:01.690
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want vanilla ice cream with </v>

2100
01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:01.690
<v Speaker 1>yours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2101
01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to let your.</v>

2102
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Let your server note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things take 20 minutes or more.</v>

2103
01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always tell you if a fancy schmancy</v>

2104
01:31:07.331 --> 01:31:07.780
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to a heads up if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chocolate souffle.</v>

2106
01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know now do.</v>

2107
01:31:13.331 --> 01:31:18.331
<v Speaker 1>When I learned that recipe I made about </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 in two weeks and uh,</v>

2108
01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I put on about 30 pounds weeks.</v>

2109
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2110
01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you now when you try to lose weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this competition?</v>

2111
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you now look at this like this is the</v>

2112
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:34.891
<v Speaker 1>new Thompson girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna eat healthy and lose all </v>

2113
01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:38.161
<v Speaker 1>this weight or do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to beat Bert Kreischer </v>

2114
01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:39.070
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to go off like a rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2115
01:31:39.071 --> 01:31:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel it becomes a little bit addictive</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2116
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:47.020
<v Speaker 1>When you start seeing some results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda reminds me of like saving money.</v>

2117
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You're addicted to success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you save money and you see the </v>

2118
01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:52.270
<v Speaker 1>number go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like,</v>

2119
01:31:52.271 --> 01:31:54.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking like even when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not making a lot of them,</v>

2120
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to save this amount of money.</v>

2121
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll surpass it and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

2122
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care about the</v>

2123
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 5>thing I thought I was saving money for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fun to see it grow.</v>

2124
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 5>That becomes the addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2125
01:32:05.051 --> 01:32:10.051
<v Speaker 5>I just want to see it grow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So though I think weight loss can be </v>

2126
01:32:10.051 --> 01:32:10.051
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go like,</v>

2127
01:32:10.051 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 5>oh well just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2128
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 5>try and lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you see the number go down.</v>

2129
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2130
01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 5>I want to keep seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep going.</v>

2131
01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 5>That's why when they have those </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter footage views of these </v>

2132
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.950
<v Speaker 5>mansions in the hamptons and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling a guy out in handcuffs because </v>

2133
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 5>you stole $500,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>from his company,</v>

2134
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 5>that's what the fuck that's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what that,</v>

2135
01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 5>that simple human need to collect that </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes,</v>

2136
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:35.070
<v Speaker 5>you become some corporate villain that'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes you fucking dig into the oil.</v>

2137
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:37.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of the ocean and every CEO</v>

2138
01:32:37.871 --> 01:32:39.740
<v Speaker 5>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2139
01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a natural thing that people do.</v>

2140
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:47.550
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was there weight loss ones healthy the </v>

2141
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 5>way last one is a healthy one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you bring up a really good point.</v>

2142
01:32:49.050 --> 01:32:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people do get addicted to success </v>

2143
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:56.610
<v Speaker 5>and they get addicted to A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of the most important </v>

2144
01:32:56.610 --> 01:32:59.641
<v Speaker 5>things about people is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find what little formula works for your </v>

2145
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:06.121
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's brain is fucking different </v>

2146
01:33:06.121 --> 01:33:09.031
<v Speaker 5>to tell everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got to go for it and they got to </v>

2147
01:33:09.031 --> 01:33:09.031
<v Speaker 5>work out like the rock and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to read a book a day like,</v>

2148
01:33:09.031 --> 01:33:09.580
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2149
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:13.420
<v Speaker 5>slow the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody doesn't have to do that,</v>

2150
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 5>but you gotta find out what it is for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2151
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:20.401
<v Speaker 5>and I think for almost everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there should be something that you're </v>

2152
01:33:20.401 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 5>pursuing that you can get better at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meaning it could be art,</v>

2153
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:27.490
<v Speaker 5>it could be like you're really in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>painting sculpture.</v>

2154
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.700
<v Speaker 5>It could be a physical thing like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>a yoga thing or a martial arts thing or </v>

2155
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.840
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank with a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 5>archery,</v>

2156
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:39.841
<v Speaker 5>a hundred different things that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could chess that you could really get </v>

2157
01:33:39.841 --> 01:33:39.841
<v Speaker 5>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2158
01:33:39.841 --> 01:33:43.560
<v Speaker 5>But I think when people work towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and then continue to do </v>

2159
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 5>something and try to improve and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>even.</v>

2160
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:49.051
<v Speaker 5>It's just your recreational tennis game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think those things bring people </v>

2161
01:33:49.051 --> 01:33:52.951
<v Speaker 5>happiness because I think people have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain amount of built in desire to </v>

2162
01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:54.580
<v Speaker 5>overcome adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>overcome problems,</v>

2163
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.070
<v Speaker 5>and we don't get enough of it in real </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2164
01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2165
01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you get something like a weight </v>

2166
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.790
<v Speaker 5>loss challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:04.090
<v Speaker 5>Anything like that where you have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult struggle,</v>

2168
01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 5>like you have an accomplishment to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're working towards.</v>

2169
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:12.990
<v Speaker 5>It gives people that sense of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which ultimately that's the real </v>

2170
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2171
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.360
<v Speaker 5>With a lot of peoples that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't enjoy their life and so then </v>

2172
01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 5>they start thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the purpose of this?</v>

2173
01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:24.090
<v Speaker 5>Then because it just keep being </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable and not happy until you're</v>

2174
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:26.340
<v Speaker 5>heart stops beating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:34:26.341 --> 01:34:29.290
<v Speaker 5>That's a miserable way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of people live like that.</v>

2176
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.930
<v Speaker 5>That's why by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is by my point for this too,</v>

2177
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:36.070
<v Speaker 5>is that I think it's a great endorsement</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fat shaming because this is a healthy</v>

2178
01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 5>result where you have two guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimately.</v>

2179
01:34:39.191 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even matter.</v>

2180
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 5>We both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We both fat,</v>

2181
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:46.600
<v Speaker 5>shamed and insulted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then so did a lot of people.</v>

2182
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:46.960
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2183
01:34:46.961 --> 01:34:51.961
<v Speaker 5>you can get away with it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>a fat guy of Jamie started fat shaming </v>

2184
01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:51.961
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd have a real issue.</v>

2185
01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:52.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2186
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.560
<v Speaker 5>Jamie skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He runs a lot,</v>

2187
01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm saying is that if we</v>
<v Speaker 5>benefited it low fat.</v>

2188
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he's.</v>

2189
01:34:58.881 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 4>He's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2190
01:34:59.931 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did definitely,</v>

2191
01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:03.560
<v Speaker 4>but you guys are all both professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians.</v>

2192
01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Like here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about a guy who's like a chef who's</v>

2193
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:12.190
<v Speaker 4>just some fucking bomb ass chef and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a master chef and he keeps creating all </v>

2194
01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:16.361
<v Speaker 4>these new dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a fat fuck and he eats like a </v>

2195
01:35:16.361 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 4>pig and he drinks wine every night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Gerard Depardieu.</v>

2196
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2197
01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 4>if that guy loves that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2198
01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not encouraging.</v>

2199
01:35:20.691 --> 01:35:25.691
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you should go with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shame everybody I'm saying what I'm </v>

2200
01:35:25.691 --> 01:35:28.541
<v Speaker 4>saying is that there is an outcome in in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the in which it can be effective and not</v>

2201
01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:30.980
<v Speaker 4>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying,</v>

2202
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.970
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's fat usually fucking fat.</v>

2203
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that in this scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the outcome could be that like it </v>

2204
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:43.721
<v Speaker 4>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say it ended today and we are </v>

2205
01:35:43.721 --> 01:35:43.721
<v Speaker 4>where we are.</v>

2206
01:35:43.721 --> 01:35:46.810
<v Speaker 4>Both of us just actually ended up eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier and working out for a month </v>

2207
01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 4>and you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we weigh less than we were healthier</v>

2208
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:54.101
<v Speaker 4>than we were a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think different people have </v>

2209
01:35:54.101 --> 01:35:55.910
<v Speaker 4>different abilities of tolerating jokes </v>
<v Speaker 4>pointed at them.</v>

2210
01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.120
<v Speaker 4>There a different aspect like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you could say something to me and </v>

2211
01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 4>it probably has a different effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's totally.</v>

2212
01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Maybe someone who doesn't do comedy or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe someone who's not used to someone </v>

2213
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:06.880
<v Speaker 4>joking around with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

2214
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:11.910
<v Speaker 4>that's a factor too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should emotionally </v>

2215
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.910
<v Speaker 4>traumatized if that person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2216
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:15.700
<v Speaker 4>I hope I didn't sound like it was trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that for some people it takes </v>

2217
01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 4>being called fat to like get them off </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ass like some people.</v>

2218
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:20.590
<v Speaker 4>My point is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2219
01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I should say that with me it</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked and with some people.</v>

2220
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a healthy way.</v>

2222
01:36:26.871 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I never took it to like really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2223
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:33.230
<v Speaker 4>it didn't affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It affected me in a motivating way.</v>

2224
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I have had a ton of </v>

2225
01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:39.701
<v Speaker 4>conversations over the years about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>health and fitness and weight loss and </v>

2226
01:36:39.701 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you wanted to do something,</v>

2227
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:43.680
<v Speaker 4>I always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2228
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:45.710
<v Speaker 4>you would definitely do something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you always worked out.</v>

2229
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2230
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just became,</v>

2231
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:53.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it became something that I want to do </v>

2232
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:54.590
<v Speaker 4>just channeled through this other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ultimately what it was.</v>

2233
01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've told this story before,</v>

2234
01:36:56.511 --> 01:37:01.511
<v Speaker 4>but when Kevin James was losing weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his manager at the time we got rid of </v>

2235
01:37:01.511 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 4>was telling him that if he loses weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loses roles.</v>

2236
01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's telling them to not be healthy?</v>

2237
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Because you won't.</v>

2238
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.410
<v Speaker 4>You won't get as much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Amanda told me,</v>

2239
01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 4>God damn crazy to the manager telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2240
01:37:11.301 --> 01:37:12.440
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't lose the weight.</v>

2241
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2242
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how that,</v>

2243
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:18.140
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck kind of advice is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

2244
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be better as a person.</v>

2245
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Just fuck up your comment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were thinking of casting.</v>

2246
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:23.100
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2247
01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:25.130
<v Speaker 4>there's this many roles so you could get</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

2248
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.520
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they would approach it </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently now because now like a </v>

2249
01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.710
<v Speaker 4>casting and it's always going to be good</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be on a set of chrome,</v>

2250
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 4>so he's going to be good to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

2251
01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:38.120
<v Speaker 4>But if you're someone like you who has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful podcast and then does netflix</v>

2252
01:37:38.121 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 4>specials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take that over all those things all</v>

2253
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good life.</v>

2254
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 4>It's the best life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're creating your own shit.</v>

2255
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.010
<v Speaker 4>You're doing your own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it when you want and you're</v>

2256
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 4>being very prolific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're having fun.</v>

2257
01:37:50.901 --> 01:37:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done two specials in what?</v>

2258
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Two and a half years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2259
01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You did</v>

2260
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>one and then he did another one was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half later,</v>

2261
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in that range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a 16 and 18 months later.</v>

2262
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.660
<v Speaker 1>A man that's fucking giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2264
01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:11.170
<v Speaker 1>but see no interference man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't have some crazy </v>

2265
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>executives that want to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction of the show.</v>

2266
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole world that I've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

2267
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Like just from writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.910
<v Speaker 1>like having good script deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:24.560
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people get involved at first </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't first there's nothing.</v>

2270
01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you and an idea and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have conversations with that.</v>

2271
01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.800
<v Speaker 1>You just want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just say I had one one </v>

2272
01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.201
<v Speaker 1>time where we had this conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an executive who said like,</v>

2273
01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 1>we kinda want shows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just make it up,</v>

2274
01:38:40.141 --> 01:38:42.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say like an HBO show,</v>

2275
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:43.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not what this.</v>

2276
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.580
<v Speaker 1>And you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2277
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And that was just one of the things they</v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

2278
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And then on the first notes path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like they read your first </v>

2279
01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.001
<v Speaker 1>draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that the same executive </v>

2280
01:38:56.001 --> 01:38:56.220
<v Speaker 1>said was just kind of feels like an hbo </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2281
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

2282
01:38:57.750 --> 01:39:00.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you said.</v>

2283
01:39:00.841 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2284
01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.020
<v Speaker 1>it's too much like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2285
01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of,</v>

2286
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:06.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of shit you can deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with on a,</v>

2287
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.050
<v Speaker 1>on a writing deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2288
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where to go from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The will.</v>

2289
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Those deals are so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2290
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you've worked with writers and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2291
01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 1>like you don't know a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit down with them,</v>

2292
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 1>start trying to write a script with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just gets really strange.</v>

2293
01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.430
<v Speaker 1>But when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the execs come in is when it really</v>

2295
01:39:23.431 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 1>gets straightened out.</v>

2296
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.900
<v Speaker 1>They have their own wacky ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pitched a show once and the guy was </v>

2297
01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:31.950
<v Speaker 1>pitching it without a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a panic attack.</v>

2298
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Think the pitch meeting where he held it</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2299
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.160
<v Speaker 1>but he had kind of a history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really nice guy,</v>

2300
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.520
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's real good writer.</v>

2301
01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Very funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be comic and then the middle of </v>

2302
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 1>this meeting he just locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

2303
01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have really struggled to try to get</v>

2304
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:53.700
<v Speaker 1>through the pitch in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't jump in.</v>

2305
01:39:53.730 --> 01:39:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I jumped I didn't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2306
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Pitches are so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2307
01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Pitches are like for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>

2308
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 1>who haven't done it or don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitching a show in my,</v>

2309
01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:08.450
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation and in my experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot like a blind date first,</v>

2310
01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:15.050
<v Speaker 1>like the first five minutes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how like a pitch fields because </v>

2311
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey you're,</v>

2312
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to meet you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2313
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.470
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2314
01:40:16.471 --> 01:40:17.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:00.</v>

2315
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2316
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2317
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 1>the usually the popular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for comedy,</v>

2318
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:28.460
<v Speaker 1>is there like first just be yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make it funny and you make a </v>

2319
01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>

2320
01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a joke about this and you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you get on a roll,</v>

2321
01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 1>like people aren't jelling like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny natural conversation,</v>

2322
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:39.780
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's like an awkward first</v>
<v Speaker 1>date where you're like yeah,</v>

2323
01:40:39.781 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you like Moose and the person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2324
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you kind of feel it being </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward and they start to be like,</v>

2325
01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a great date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2326
01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>

2327
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know if I would go on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second date with you.</v>

2328
01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like the field they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the idea?</v>

2329
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And you're already feeling like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a good citizen,</v>

2330
01:40:57.430 --> 01:41:02.430
<v Speaker 1>a good date to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start trying to throw out </v>

2331
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>an idea like well you'll like this even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though I don't think you like me,</v>

2332
01:41:04.570 --> 01:41:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you kind of either like either </v>

2333
01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:09.570
<v Speaker 1>rolls down that hill where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave the room.</v>

2334
01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Like that was awkward.</v>

2335
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:14.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is still one step removed from an </v>

2336
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.500
<v Speaker 4>audition though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Additions the worst that is.</v>

2337
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

2338
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>

2339
01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:23.281
<v Speaker 1>you feel like sometimes you walk in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room in an audition and you feel like </v>

2340
01:41:23.281 --> 01:41:25.390
<v Speaker 1>the casting director or person made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

2341
01:41:25.391 --> 01:41:30.391
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you walk in the room you ever had </v>

2342
01:41:30.391 --> 01:41:30.391
<v Speaker 1>that where like you walk in and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2343
01:41:30.391 --> 01:41:31.570
<v Speaker 1>this person is definitely a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep going.</v>

2344
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.600
<v Speaker 1>You gotta keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go check emails once during an </v>

2345
01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:36.600
<v Speaker 1>audition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2346
01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.490
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another time I improvise a line and</v>

2347
01:41:39.491 --> 01:41:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the guy laughed and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was rude,</v>

2348
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was.</v>

2349
01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to the script.</v>

2350
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2351
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 1>punch to the fucking gut like that.</v>

2352
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:52.260
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2353
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.270
<v Speaker 1>have you had a bad pitch?</v>

2354
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that was a bad pitch where the guy </v>

2355
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.870
<v Speaker 4>had a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the end of that.</v>

2356
01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I tried to pitch that like where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2357
01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.410
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going</v>

2358
01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.810
<v Speaker 4>terrible right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pitched the show to do,</v>

2359
01:42:03.811 --> 01:42:08.811
<v Speaker 4>laughed make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought it was joking when I was </v>

2360
01:42:08.811 --> 01:42:10.401
<v Speaker 4>totally serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about a bunch of girls who work </v>

2361
01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:14.421
<v Speaker 4>at a bikini pizza place during the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and at night they fight crime and it's </v>

2362
01:42:14.421 --> 01:42:17.630
<v Speaker 4>called pizza slots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2363
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.950
<v Speaker 4>They work at a place called pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2364
01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.020
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the deal?</v>

2365
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to do.</v>

2366
01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.750
<v Speaker 4>I was just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a stone idea I had,</v>

2367
01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:30.080
<v Speaker 4>but the idea was to do like like a super</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the top ridiculous,</v>

2368
01:42:31.801 --> 01:42:35.430
<v Speaker 4>like Charlie's angels type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's some girls that worked at a pizza</v>

2369
01:42:35.431 --> 01:42:36.020
<v Speaker 4>place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2370
01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:40.290
<v Speaker 4>That was the cover for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like secret crime fighting organization.</v>

2371
01:42:40.291 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 4>It was so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't have ideas for scripts and</v>

2372
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:44.220
<v Speaker 4>have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

2373
01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:49.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I would at least be smiling if </v>

2374
01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:49.260
<v Speaker 4>that was the pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He laughed.</v>

2375
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:50.040
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

2376
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 1>do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You received my mayor sizzle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm basically like a Rob Ford type </v>

2378
01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:57.880
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2380
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:05.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago and we pitched it </v>

2381
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 1>to a lot like we sent them that or we </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it with us.</v>

2382
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:07.990

2383
01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like meeting a new person and there</v>

01:44:21.101 --> 01:44:26.101
<v Speaker 4>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can tell that was obviously the </v>

2412

2418
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Talking about black tech accused of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

2419
01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:37.830
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>

2420
01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was um,</v>

2421
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a written by Tom Rubric.</v>

2422
01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:49.380
<v Speaker 4>It was a really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a letterman writer for years and </v>

2423
01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.710
<v Speaker 4>years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really funny guy and I just played the </v>

2424
01:44:52.710 --> 01:44:53.210
<v Speaker 4>role,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but pitching that was like a,</v>

2425
01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:57.070
<v Speaker 4>was a rollercoaster because we had so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many good people like involved in it,</v>

2426
01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2427
01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:58.590
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2428
01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.430
<v Speaker 4>and then when you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the pitch,</v>

2429
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:03.100
<v Speaker 4>I just can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm repeating it,</v>

2430
01:45:03.101 --> 01:45:05.440
<v Speaker 4>but it's like a blind date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like people would be like,</v>

2431
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:07.150
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking awesome.</v>

2432
01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.920
<v Speaker 4>And then they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate you.</v>

2433
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Think in the position you're going to an</v>
<v Speaker 4>executive and you're saying,</v>

2434
01:45:13.241 --> 01:45:14.200
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend money,</v>

<v Speaker 4>spend money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend money.</v>

2436
01:45:15.131 --> 01:45:16.140
<v Speaker 4>I want to make a hit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

2438
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:20.440
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of girls in their bikinis and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get the fuck out.</v>

2439
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2440
01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.980
<v Speaker 4>that's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid idea.</v>

2441
01:45:23.981 --> 01:45:27.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every now and then someone will come</v>

2442
01:45:27.791 --> 01:45:30.280
<v Speaker 4>in their office and something clicks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they decide,</v>

2443
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:32.890

<v Speaker 4>make happens all the time through.</v>

2447

<v Speaker 4>you get so many more chances after that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.520
<v Speaker 5>I've seen those before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that one seemed blood just picks up </v>

2481
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 5>efficiently or just cuts them in half </v>
<v Speaker 5>strips.</v>

2482
01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 5>The look of that saws in half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lifts it up in the air,</v>

2483
01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.580
<v Speaker 5>buzzes through all the bark as it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>holding it.</v>

2484
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buzzes through the bark.</v>

2485
01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.630
<v Speaker 5>Totally strips the bark off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's crazy.</v>

2486
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 5>Trips all the branches off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cuts it.</v>

2487
01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:29.890
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not dune manning that.</v>

2488
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.800

<v Speaker 5>Fucking wild.</v>

2489
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so disturbing when you see the </v>

2490
01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:37.160
<v Speaker 5>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brutal efficiency of it.</v>

2491
01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Look how it just saw us through it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all those wheels and gears on it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:47:43.810 --> 01:47:45.870
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not shit.</v>

2495
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.960
<v Speaker 5>Compared to the owl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The owl swoops down and jacks this bird.</v>

2496
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But actually looks like a pigeon more </v>

2497
01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:56.240
<v Speaker 5>than it was like a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2498
01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.750
<v Speaker 5>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That birds will be the eyes and the </v>

2499
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.750
<v Speaker 5>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The see the eyes.</v>

2500
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Other bird doesn't even know what </v>

2503
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:08.120
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2504
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:08.120
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you look at his face.</v>

2505
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:08.280
<v Speaker 5>That looks like a raptor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

2506
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2508
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:15.950
<v Speaker 5>I think that's some kind of a raptor and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a distance that's to mood and it sees </v>

2509
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:20.370
<v Speaker 5>them and they don't see ya later and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't just grab you.</v>

2510
01:48:20.371 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 5>They kick you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it closes in.</v>

2511
01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.400
<v Speaker 5>Watch it one more time when we're like </v>
<v Speaker 5>say this now.</v>

2514
01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:31.860
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To watch animals do it,</v>

2515
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 5>but watch how he kicks him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pitch like it's not just a grab,</v>

2516
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:40.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a stun like it kicks them and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>sinks the clause at man and they.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but it's when people are like,</v>

2527
01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're still good.</v>

2528
01:49:16.371 --> 01:49:18.880
<v Speaker 5>I think it will rip your fucking face </v>
<v Speaker 5>off like it.</v>

2529
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:21.600
<v Speaker 5>He has a really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really well written bit about it.</v>

2530
01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 5>But look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

2531
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.900
<v Speaker 5>People try to make them cute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2532
01:49:24.901 --> 01:49:25.800
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're adorable.</v>

2533
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:27.210
<v Speaker 5>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.630
<v Speaker 5>They're night predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Night flying predators with giant eyes.</v>

2535
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 5>Eyes too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2536
01:49:33.690 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were at,</v>

2537
01:49:34.591 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a rescue place that we go to.</v>

2538
01:49:36.511 --> 01:49:38.340
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2539
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:42.960
<v Speaker 5>they take care of wildlife and </v>
<v Speaker 5>rehabilitate them and they have this one</v>

2540
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:44.220
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that was blind.</v>

2541
01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.500
<v Speaker 5>It pretty much blind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It couldn't fly.</v>

2542
01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.330
<v Speaker 5>It would perch and it was a really small</v>
<v Speaker 5>owl.</v>

2543
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.780
<v Speaker 5>And you sit there and look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I think it's an s Omar.</v>

2544
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I think the places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget where it's at,</v>

2545
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in the 808,</v>

2546
01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 5>but it's got this little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2547
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 5>this little owl and you're looking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>his fucking eyes,</v>

2548
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:02.230
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

2549
01:50:02.231 --> 01:50:07.231
<v Speaker 5>what a strange creature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And his eyes look almost like cracked </v>

2550
01:50:07.231 --> 01:50:10.800
<v Speaker 5>because it was blind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it looks like you're looking </v>

2551
01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:10.800
<v Speaker 5>through a crack television glass that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>bold.</v>

2552
01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's old.</v>

2553
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.810
<v Speaker 5>He's older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe something happened to his eyes to.</v>

2554
01:50:13.811 --> 01:50:15.160
<v Speaker 5>It might've been an injury or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2555
01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes birds were flying to windows.</v>

2556
01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:18.640
<v Speaker 5>That has a lot.</v>

2557
01:50:18.650 --> 01:50:19.260
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2558
01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:22.010
<v Speaker 1>the outline of one on a window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2559
01:50:22.011 --> 01:50:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at those eyes.</v>

2560
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:27.630
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that one bird blind out?</v>

2561
01:50:27.631 --> 01:50:28.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2562
01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:29.920
<v Speaker 5>look at his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look like they're cracked inside.</v>

2563
01:50:29.921 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 5>And like there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something missing.</v>

2564
01:50:31.601 --> 01:50:36.601
<v Speaker 5>Like he's looking at the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy looks like a portal to the </v>

2565
01:50:36.601 --> 01:50:36.601
<v Speaker 5>heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at his right eye.</v>

2566
01:50:36.601 --> 01:50:38.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like a constellation map or his </v>
<v Speaker 5>left eye.</v>

2567
01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.910
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The left eye is a constellation of storm</v>

2568
01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:46.940
<v Speaker 5>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even a reflection of something that </v>

2569
01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:46.940
<v Speaker 5>looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like in that I.</v>

2570
01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.900
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just such a bizarre animal.</v>

2571
01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.380
<v Speaker 5>Like if that didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if,</v>

2572
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.850
<v Speaker 5>if there was no owls and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>found one,</v>

2573
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.590
<v Speaker 5>you'd be obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

2574
01:50:55.591 --> 01:50:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that new animal?</v>

2575
01:50:57.331 --> 01:50:58.410
<v Speaker 5>They discovered?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:50:58.411 --> 01:51:00.510
<v Speaker 5>It's called an owl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're calling in an owl dude.</v>

2577
01:51:00.511 --> 01:51:05.511
<v Speaker 5>It's this giant flying thing with huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>talents and it only hunts at night and </v>

2578
01:51:06.631 --> 01:51:07.740
<v Speaker 5>it's smart as fuck.</v>

2579
01:51:08.230 --> 01:51:13.230
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just swooped down and Jack </v>

2580
01:51:13.230 --> 01:51:13.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:51:13.230 --> 01:51:13.340
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

2582
01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible predator.</v>

2583
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting that the balance</v>

2584
01:51:17.831 --> 01:51:22.831
<v Speaker 5>of those things other than when people </v>
<v Speaker 5>get infected or involved rather with a </v>

2585
01:51:22.831 --> 01:51:25.210
<v Speaker 5>balance of those things is like how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them exist.</v>

2586
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 5>It's all dependent upon how much there </v>
<v Speaker 5>is for them to eat.</v>

2587
01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like more rabbits.</v>

2588
01:51:30.251 --> 01:51:32.350
<v Speaker 5>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more rats there are,</v>

2589
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:34.510
<v Speaker 5>the more the hours will thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The mortal.</v>

2590
01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:37.660
<v Speaker 5>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't have those things,</v>

2591
01:51:37.661 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 5>like people are always in La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're always worried about coyotes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They're uh,</v>

2643
01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 5>they used to call them prairie wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they can breed with bowls.</v>

2644
01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:39.240
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2645
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have that thing called a Coi Wolf.</v>

2646
01:53:40.971 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 5>That's like a hybrid between a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a wolf.</v>

2647
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:49.510
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just a hybrid between a coyote </v>

2648
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.510
<v Speaker 5>and a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's actually a lot of them.</v>

2649
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Now there's like the percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hybrid.</v>

2650
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:54.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like sometimes a hybrid mixes with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a pure coyote.</v>

2651
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes a hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mix it with another hybrid,</v>

2652
01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 5>sometimes a hybrid mixes with another </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolf.</v>

2653
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 5>So there's like a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels of coyotes and wolves.</v>

2654
01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:06.200
<v Speaker 5>But ultimately they're all wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes are a type of wolf.</v>

2655
01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:10.550
<v Speaker 5>But the difference between dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves as dramatic.</v>

2656
01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I read that lonely by image.</v>

2657
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:14.040
<v Speaker 5>By image only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:16.430
<v Speaker 5>The genetics are the exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then the,</v>

2659
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:21.580
<v Speaker 5>the natural abilities of them that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't say the genetics because </v>

2660
01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:22.320
<v Speaker 5>obviously they vary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2661
01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I should say is when you </v>

2662
01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:29.210
<v Speaker 5>research a dog's DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all dogs came from wolves.</v>

2663
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they became a dog.</v>

2664
01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.910
<v Speaker 5>But obviously an English bulldog is very</v>
<v Speaker 5>different than A.</v>

2665
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Husky is very different than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>rottweiler is.</v>

2666
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:39.170
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of weird variations in </v>
<v Speaker 5>genes,</v>

2667
01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.070
<v Speaker 5>but all of them originated with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

2668
01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:44.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't even know how.</v>

2669
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:46.810
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the coyotes come from.</v>

2670
01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:49.460
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolves are wolves up in.</v>

2671
01:54:49.461 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Some coyotes have bread with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we did a fear factor shoot,</v>

2672
01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:57.761
<v Speaker 5>once we stumbled upon this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm a litter of puppies that this </v>

2673
01:54:57.951 --> 01:55:00.380
<v Speaker 5>Labrador had had with the coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>

2674
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever see mountain lion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen mountain lions.</v>

2675
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.460
<v Speaker 5>I've seen him twice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2676
01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.800
<v Speaker 5>I saw one in Colorado and I saw one in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Santa Barbara,</v>

2677
01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 5>so I wanted Montecito,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Montecito neighborhood.</v>

2678
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:12.890
<v Speaker 5>We were driving to a restaurant.</v>

2679
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:18.070
<v Speaker 5>We're driving up the street and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing runs across the road and I'm </v>

2680
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.070
<v Speaker 5>looking at it and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2681
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:20.630
<v Speaker 5>I saw its tail and then oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a cat.</v>

2682
01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.580
<v Speaker 5>That's a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big cat.</v>

2683
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.640
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's such a different feeling,</v>

2684
01:55:25.641 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you see,</v>

2685
01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.840
<v Speaker 5>and when I say big cat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was probably about 60 or 70 pounds </v>

2686
01:55:33.321 --> 01:55:38.321
<v Speaker 5>anywhere between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just guessing anywhere between 50 </v>

2687
01:55:38.321 --> 01:55:38.850
<v Speaker 5>and 70 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't big like a big mountain lion,</v>

2688
01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:41.870
<v Speaker 5>like some of them get to be 150 plus </v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds.</v>

2689
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:44.430
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like that big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can it be bad motherfuckers?</v>

2690
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.460
<v Speaker 5>They're all bad motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm my point is that 51 will fuck you </v>

2691
01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:49.460
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

2692
01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:52.350
<v Speaker 5>$50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mountain Lion will fuck you up man.</v>

2693
01:55:52.351 --> 01:55:54.030
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2694
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:59.090
<v Speaker 5>that's a terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to see it in this really nice </v>

2695
01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:01.521
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went to this really nice Italian </v>

2696
01:56:01.521 --> 01:56:01.521
<v Speaker 5>restaurant.</v>

2697
01:56:01.521 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 5>We're driving down a residential street </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're like,</v>

2698
01:56:01.771 --> 01:56:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a killer.</v>

2699
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:06.060
<v Speaker 5>Just Roman looking for dogs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:56:06.061 --> 01:56:08.970
<v Speaker 5>What if it's saw you walking your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know they'll take your dog.</v>

2701
01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:14.250
<v Speaker 5>A coyote is take your dog all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hear stories about old ladies and </v>

2702
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:14.760
<v Speaker 5>Brentwood walking there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Poodles,</v>

2703
01:56:14.761 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 5>Click,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Click,</v>

2704
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:17.130
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click to hear the clicks of the nails of</v>

2705
01:56:17.131 --> 01:56:22.131
<v Speaker 5>the coyote behind them and the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>just snatches that dollar right off the </v>

2706
01:56:22.131 --> 01:56:22.131
<v Speaker 5>leash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2707
01:56:22.131 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 5>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll eat anything.</v>

2708
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Especially when they're in urban </v>
<v Speaker 5>environments,</v>

2709
01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 5>they actually target cats and dogs </v>
<v Speaker 5>because cats and dogs kill a lot of what</v>

2710
01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:32.550
<v Speaker 5>they kill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they don't just look at a cat.</v>

2711
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.760
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the things I found out </v>
<v Speaker 5>from this coyote America book that I </v>

2712
01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:41.100
<v Speaker 5>read was that they don't just look at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cat as a something to eat.</v>

2713
01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 5>They really look at it as a competing </v>
<v Speaker 5>predator.</v>

2714
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:44.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I got to get rid of that.</v>

2715
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that things eating all the </v>

2716
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 5>fucking birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2717
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 5>Things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eating all the rats so things eat.</v>

2718
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Know it's killing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ever thought of that.</v>

2719
01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:51.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2720
01:56:51.141 --> 01:56:56.141
<v Speaker 5>they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't like having competing </v>

2721
01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:56.141
<v Speaker 5>predators around competition mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll kill it.</v>

2722
01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:57.420
<v Speaker 5>If it was a chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously they would kill it.</v>

2723
01:56:57.421 --> 01:56:59.940
<v Speaker 5>If it was something that wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing like it was a bunny rabbit,</v>

2724
01:56:59.941 --> 01:57:04.941
<v Speaker 5>they would kill it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's hard to say why they're killing </v>

2725
01:57:04.941 --> 01:57:08.511
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They easily could be killing it for </v>

2726
01:57:08.511 --> 01:57:10.011
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they believe that they target those </v>

2727
01:57:10.011 --> 01:57:10.230
<v Speaker 5>animals because those animals are fellow</v>
<v Speaker 5>predators.</v>

2728
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They must know.</v>

2729
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 5>They must be able to tell when </v>
<v Speaker 5>something's a predator.</v>

2730
01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:17.070
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw this piece of news piece about how</v>

2731
01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:21.480
<v Speaker 5>they would have much better chance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>survival.</v>

2732
01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:26.430
<v Speaker 5>The mountain lions out here if we had </v>
<v Speaker 5>overpasses over the freeways for them to</v>

2733
01:57:26.431 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 5>roam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:57:27.121 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 5>They're going to build those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they going to build it in Europe?</v>

2735
01:57:30.151 --> 01:57:32.640
<v Speaker 5>They have someplace I've got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm here and I'm gonna spend millions of</v>

2736
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.740
<v Speaker 5>dollars and people were up in arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People fuck these things.</v>

2737
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of them I'm just killed.</v>

2738
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:42.770
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we will look this up the other </v>

2739
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.770
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2740
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Twelve Alpacas or 1111 alpacas and one </v>
<v Speaker 5>goat in Malibu.</v>

2741
01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Just went on a rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just decided I just want to jump the </v>

2742
01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 5>fence and fuck these things up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't eat one of them.</v>

2743
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:56.200
<v Speaker 5>Killed them for the fuck of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like,</v>

2744
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:58.410
<v Speaker 5>like for fun or because they saw it as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good time.</v>

2745
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good time.</v>

2746
01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Can't resist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of things stuck in a </v>

2747
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:04.100
<v Speaker 5>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get in that cage.</v>

2748
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 5>I get over the top of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>

2749
01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:09.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like probably a thrill for </v>

2750
01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:09.740
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2751
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 5>These are these totally team things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't going to run good.</v>

2752
01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Like think about how many times I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>is trying to sneak up on a deer.</v>

2753
01:58:16.171 --> 01:58:17.740
<v Speaker 5>The deer season point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Point.</v>

2754
01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

2755
01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:21.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how many times did that thing.</v>

2756
01:58:21.321 --> 01:58:26.321
<v Speaker 5>I have to go on a stock before it </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually gets a deer walked out of that </v>

2757
01:58:26.321 --> 01:58:26.640
<v Speaker 5>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it just,</v>

2758
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.880
<v Speaker 5>it just satisfies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This probably came from all over the </v>

2759
01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:31.880
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2760
01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:32.010
<v Speaker 5>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:37.011
<v Speaker 5>See if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they gave a depredation order to kill </v>

2762
01:58:37.011 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 5>this thing and people are up in arms </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

2763
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:37.920
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2764
01:58:37.921 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 5>we want the monster that kills the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Alpaca.</v>

2765
01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 5>Stay near our children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our house.</v>

2766
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 5>She.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2767
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:45.690
<v Speaker 5>don't kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2768
01:58:46.190 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big mountain lion fan.</v>

2769
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.430
<v Speaker 5>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get me wrong.</v>

2770
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:53.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan of wolves to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you got something in your </v>

2771
01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood that kills 11 alpacas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if it was a werewolf?</v>

2772
01:58:55.990 --> 01:59:00.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if a Werewolf was in your </v>

2773
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:00.990
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood and decide to kill a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of sheep?</v>

2774
01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 5>Got Reprieve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They decided to change this.</v>

2775
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave a depredation order,</v>

2776
01:59:05.861 --> 01:59:07.720
<v Speaker 5>which means the rancher was allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill it.</v>

2777
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>So it looks like the mountain lion got a</v>
<v Speaker 5>reprieve.</v>

2778
01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 5>The neighborhood offered to shoot the </v>
<v Speaker 5>big cat known as p 45.</v>

2779
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Can make that a little bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you sir.</v>

2780
01:59:18.590 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Victoria von Pearling.</v>

2781
01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 5>But she told reporters it was never her </v>
<v Speaker 5>intention to have a,</v>

2782
01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:26.230
<v Speaker 5>have the cougar killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead,</v>

2783
01:59:26.231 --> 01:59:31.231
<v Speaker 5>she said she'd hook game officials would</v>
<v Speaker 5>capture it and get it away from her </v>

2784
01:59:31.231 --> 01:59:31.231
<v Speaker 5>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2785
01:59:31.231 --> 01:59:32.640
<v Speaker 5>So the woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2786
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:37.770
<v Speaker 5>have the Alpacas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't want the mountain lion to be </v>

2787
01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:37.770
<v Speaker 5>killed.</v>

2788
01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:40.800
<v Speaker 5>She indicated that public outrage </v>
<v Speaker 5>might've played a role in her decision </v>

2789
01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:41.860
<v Speaker 5>adding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was surprised by the vitriol.</v>

2790
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:42.730
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

2791
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:43.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2792
01:59:43.691 --> 01:59:46.090
<v Speaker 5>the people who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially someone who's like a rancher,</v>

2793
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:51.120
<v Speaker 5>is raising the Alpacas and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying attention to how nutty like </v>

2794
01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.570
<v Speaker 5>social justice warriors get online when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes to things like this.</v>

2795
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:56.560
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing folks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a problem.</v>

2796
01:59:56.561 --> 02:00:01.561
<v Speaker 5>If you've got something that's in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood that kills a lot of </v>

2797
02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:01.561
<v Speaker 5>livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially that the way it did it,</v>

2798
02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 5>there were killed a bunch of them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't even eat it.</v>

2799
02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Where would they drop that thing by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way?</v>

2800
02:00:05.621 --> 02:00:06.790
<v Speaker 5>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they were trying to do that,</v>

2801
02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:09.610
<v Speaker 5>they would take it somewhere like big </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear or you know,</v>

2802
02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:12.990
<v Speaker 5>somewhere probably close by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but far enough away that it would,</v>

2803
02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:15.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe could stake out a new territory,</v>

2804
02:00:15.821 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 5>but there's no guarantee that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>come back.</v>

2805
02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:23.160
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing about mountain lions as </v>

2806
02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.541
<v Speaker 5>opposed to people is they know where the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck they are and they know how to get </v>

2807
02:00:24.541 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they have some weird built in sense</v>

2808
02:00:25.001 --> 02:00:28.060
<v Speaker 5>of direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like mountain lions will travel hundreds</v>

2809
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:29.800
<v Speaker 5>of miles in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds,</v>

2810
02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:34.800
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll get back to where they were </v>

2811
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:34.800
<v Speaker 5>due.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a mountain man that was killed</v>

2812
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.430
<v Speaker 5>in fucking Connecticut and it originated</v>
<v Speaker 5>in South Dakota.</v>

2813
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 5>That's a really far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:41.770
<v Speaker 5>It was killed by a car and Connecticut </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were like,</v>

2815
02:00:41.771 --> 02:00:45.440
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2816
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.170
<v Speaker 5>Why is there a mountain lion on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>road?</v>

2817
02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:48.760
<v Speaker 5>See if you can find that story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

2818
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 5>So I don't butcher with my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Memory didn't take Algebra in today.</v>

2819
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:53.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2820
02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.570
<v Speaker 5>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forgot to grab it on the way out now.</v>

2821
02:00:55.571 --> 02:00:56.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep you sharper.</v>

2822
02:00:57.490 --> 02:00:59.740
<v Speaker 5>All for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the phlegm didn't help either.</v>

2823
02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 5>Phlegm at the beginning of the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>time yet Connecticut Mountain Lion </v>

2824
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.500
<v Speaker 5>walked from South Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 5>$1,500,</v>

2825
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:09.760
<v Speaker 5>140 pound male.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cougar,</v>

2826
02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:13.180
<v Speaker 5>which is a big cat estimate between two </v>
<v Speaker 5>and five years old,</v>

2827
02:01:13.181 --> 02:01:18.181
<v Speaker 5>almost certainly left its native habitat</v>
<v Speaker 5>to look for mates but went in the wrong </v>

2828
02:01:18.181 --> 02:01:21.220
<v Speaker 5>direction according to Adrian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why little the animal?</v>

2829
02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 5>How do you say that name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adrian?</v>

2830
02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Why Devon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Devon Devon.</v>

2831
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:31.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm a mammal ecologist with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin Department of natural </v>

2832
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:31.960
<v Speaker 5>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was looking for love in all the wrong</v>

2833
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:33.610
<v Speaker 5>places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is one of those expressions.</v>

2834
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:37.750
<v Speaker 5>He was struck by an Suv on the Wilbur </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cross Parkway in Milford,</v>

2835
02:01:37.751 --> 02:01:38.890
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know where that is.</v>

2836
02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 5>I used to play pool around there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just play pool and Milford.</v>

2837
02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:42.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that area.</v>

2838
02:01:43.230 --> 02:01:47.390
<v Speaker 5>It was Milford on June 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The driver was unhurt,</v>

2839
02:01:47.391 --> 02:01:50.190
<v Speaker 5>but the cougar died at the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck did that.</v>

2840
02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Cooter was just glass and then the guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit him.</v>

2841
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:57.370
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting that they initially </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought that had been released from </v>

2842
02:01:57.370 --> 02:02:00.041
<v Speaker 5>captivity given that no mountain line </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been cited in the state for more </v>

2843
02:02:00.041 --> 02:02:00.041
<v Speaker 5>than 100 years.</v>

2844
02:02:00.041 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's so long,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can.</v>

2847
02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:08.160
<v Speaker 5>They've spotted them and a lot of places</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now they're fact like a big one is </v>

2848

<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the one where the lady is </v>
<v Speaker 5>walking down a fence?</v>

<v Speaker 5>and as she's walking down the bridge,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and runs past and she filmed the whole </v>

2854
02:02:24.881 --> 02:02:24.881
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's freaking out.</v>

2866
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:04.040
<v Speaker 5>It runs by this lady within a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet over.</v>

02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3022
02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Aniston's.</v>

3023
02:09:19.110 --> 02:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so you just said that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Good Solid Jennifer Aniston movie.</v>

3027
02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a fucking friends.</v>

3028
02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'd never watched friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

3029
02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just formulaic.</v>

3030
02:09:31.091 --> 02:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Man is generic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it people like the fencers.</v>

3031
02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3032
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hit,</v>

3033
02:09:35.771 --> 02:09:36.880
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits all the notes.</v>

3034
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're writing a sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those characters plays one of </v>

3035
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the like archetype people and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>got people that had chemistry.</v>

3036
02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:49.591
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched Seinfeld when I was on </v>

3037
02:09:49.591 --> 02:09:49.591
<v Speaker 1>the air and I never watched friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld.</v>

3038
02:09:49.591 --> 02:09:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I've watched a couple of frasiers and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would always watch it for like 10 </v>

3039
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.950
<v Speaker 1>minutes and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

3040
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld is really the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one that's.</v>

3041
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.380
<v Speaker 1>If you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever watch mad about you and go,</v>

3042
02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.250
<v Speaker 1>is there something with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I thinking wrong?</v>

3043
02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see people watch it like family </v>

3044
02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.321
<v Speaker 1>members and laughing and that's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I would think something's </v>

3045
02:10:10.321 --> 02:10:11.260
<v Speaker 1>wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after I was like,</v>

3046
02:10:11.261 --> 02:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3047
02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said to him,</v>

3048
02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:17.080
<v Speaker 1>what do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not retarded,</v>

3049
02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:19.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think the people that are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

3050
02:10:19.121 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's an intelligence thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3051
02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3052

3053
02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:31.500
<v Speaker 1>figuring out the people that focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>better pro because you went different </v>

3054
02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:31.690

<v Speaker 1>That's fucking excellent.</v>

3056
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.320
<v Speaker 4>All bullshit aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what you like.</v>

3057
02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>black hair and black mirror,</v>

3059
02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:43.080
<v Speaker 4>black mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched the one where the guy,</v>

3060
02:10:43.081 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 4>I finally watched it and I went right to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one where the guy records memories.</v>

3061
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:48.870
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone can.</v>

3062
02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen what we've been talking </v>

3063
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 4>about for so long that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that show's phenomenal?</v>

3064
02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to one up me motherfucker </v>

<v Speaker 4>masturbation one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3066
02:11:03.670 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying on that show on Black Mirror.</v>

3067
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:08.280
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3068
02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.040
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an episode on masturbation.</v>

3069
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:15.350
<v Speaker 4>I've only seen two episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the first one where the guy fucks </v>

3070
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:16.040
<v Speaker 4>the pig and I saw this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the second one that I saw was,</v>

3071
02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to watch this one specifically </v>

3072
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 4>because it's about a subject that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly talking about,</v>

3073
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:22.820
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is recording memories that they're</v>

3074
02:11:22.821 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to record memories.</v>

3075
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.460
<v Speaker 4>It's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna happen,</v>

3076
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:30.970
<v Speaker 4>it's just a matter of whether or not we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can survive the next hundred years or </v>

3077
02:11:30.970 --> 02:11:30.970
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is before we get hit by an </v>
<v Speaker 4>asteroid or.</v>

3078
02:11:31.170 --> 02:11:36.170
<v Speaker 4>But one of these days they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think about how crazy it is that </v>

3079
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:38.360
<v Speaker 4>200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted a painting is something if</v>

3080
02:11:38.361 --> 02:11:40.160
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to picture something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather you would have to paint it.</v>

3081
02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to draw or paint it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was so,</v>

3082
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:44.750
<v Speaker 4>so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 200 years ago.</v>

3083
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Not Long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:50.530
<v Speaker 4>No photographs ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So no one had ever seen anything that </v>

3085
02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:51.020
<v Speaker 4>they didn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You either saw it or you didn't say it.</v>

3086
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we have done is let you see </v>

3087
02:11:56.050 --> 02:11:56.050
<v Speaker 4>things you've never gotten anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>near.</v>

3088
02:11:56.050 --> 02:12:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Like in some weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've already connected people's </v>

3089
02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:02.660
<v Speaker 4>memories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my memories of you know,</v>

3090
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:04.460
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever I did this last weekend,</v>

3091
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>I could show it to you on my phone.</v>

3092
02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went fishing in Hawaii.</v>

3093
02:12:07.090 --> 02:12:12.090
<v Speaker 4>Look at some of my memories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm showing you my fucking memories and </v>

3094
02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:12.090
<v Speaker 4>just shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like Morse code,</v>

3095
02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like a,</v>

3096
02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking teletype machine there.</v>

3097
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not the internet and I think </v>

3098
02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:23.250
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy that your children will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to grow up and think about how </v>

3099
02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:25.940
<v Speaker 4>about yours as well?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snapchat spectacles,</v>

3103
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:41.890
<v Speaker 4>which is the early version of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about to do a surgery </v>

3104
02:12:41.890 --> 02:12:41.890
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3105
02:12:41.890 --> 02:12:44.300
<v Speaker 4>what kind of surgery is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3106
02:12:44.301 --> 02:12:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Warning.</v>

3107
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I want a heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotTa pee,</v>

3108
02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:49.100
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go pee bro.</v>

3109
02:12:49.101 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I watched this guy get cut open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's super interesting.</v>

3110
02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's through his eyes.</v>

3111
02:12:54.261 --> 02:12:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3112
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:56.690
<v Speaker 4>So the snapchat glasses or essential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3113
02:12:56.691 --> 02:12:58.280
<v Speaker 4>cameras that are connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

3114
02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To your snapchat account,</v>

3115
02:13:00.291 --> 02:13:01.390
<v Speaker 4>I would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3116
02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's nuts.</v>

3117
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Hands off camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have to.</v>

3118
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:11.050
<v Speaker 4>People love them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were having sex on it and like </v>

3119
02:13:11.050 --> 02:13:11.120
<v Speaker 4>how dare they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're sharing the porn</v>

3120
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:16.121
<v Speaker 4>videos online but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can watch each other fuck </v>

3121
02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:16.121
<v Speaker 4>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's essentially the same thing.</v>

3122
02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 4>They've already got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn,</v>

3123
02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not like it's anything brilliant on that</v>

3124
02:13:21.021 --> 02:13:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Black Mirror episode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The different concepts that come up with</v>

3125
02:13:23.991 --> 02:13:28.991
<v Speaker 4>that are super interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>outstanding job and it was also weird </v>

3126
02:13:28.991 --> 02:13:33.371
<v Speaker 4>how their eyes would glaze over when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would look at their own so they </v>

3127
02:13:33.371 --> 02:13:33.371
<v Speaker 4>could at their stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through their eyes.</v>

3128
02:13:33.371 --> 02:13:33.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm giving it away too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3129
02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 4>It's been out for quite a while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what I didn't see it don't spoil </v>

3130
02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 4>alert things.</v>

3131
02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.480
<v Speaker 4>People are mad at me for spoiler alert </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the marketing dead.</v>

3132
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do folks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3133
02:13:42.031 --> 02:13:44.190
<v Speaker 4>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hit that button quick.</v>

3134
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:45.970
<v Speaker 4>If you're nowhere near it and you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spoiler alert,</v>

3135
02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 4>you're not near your falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like fuck.</v>

3136
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:53.480
<v Speaker 4>By the time you get there we should give</v>
<v Speaker 4>them like spoiler alert and then 10 </v>

3137
02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.630
<v Speaker 4>seconds like next time we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say something about something.</v>

3138
02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:56.830
<v Speaker 4>We'll say spoiler alert and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>countdown.</v>

3139
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:58.140
<v Speaker 4>That'd be annoying though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3140
02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.280
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what will I should have like a </v>

3141
02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:05.960
<v Speaker 4>countdown on my desk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little thing that I could press </v>

3142
02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:06.780
<v Speaker 4>at any moment and it just gives me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flat 10 seconds.</v>

3143
02:14:06.781 --> 02:14:09.780
<v Speaker 4>Can that be done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'll just keep talking and I'll</v>

3144
02:14:09.781 --> 02:14:11.790
<v Speaker 4>give you a spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they hit the button one.</v>

3145
02:14:11.791 --> 02:14:16.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm about to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely get out of the fucking </v>

3146
02:14:16.791 --> 02:14:16.791
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to know,</v>

3147
02:14:16.791 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got seven seconds.</v>

3148
02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four.</v>

3149
02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Then how are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about it for 10 minutes.</v>

3150
02:14:22.690 --> 02:14:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough shit more.</v>

3151
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I thought was really interesting in</v>

3152
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:37.251
<v Speaker 4>the Black Mirror thing is that when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>had that one late can't talk about that </v>

3153
02:14:37.251 --> 02:14:41.181
<v Speaker 4>I'll spoil or it um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just thought the way they handled </v>

3154
02:14:41.181 --> 02:14:42.120
<v Speaker 4>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really well done because it,</v>

3155
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:47.240
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like normal people have today </v>

3156
02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.510
<v Speaker 4>that we're faced with this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it as opposed to like.</v>

3157
02:14:50.851 --> 02:14:53.370
<v Speaker 4>Westworld is weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love westworld.</v>

3158
02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's weird to me that it's 30 years </v>

3159
02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:00.420
<v Speaker 4>in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything is pretty standard.</v>

3160
02:15:00.421 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 4>Like the way they're doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a tablet and the everything,</v>

3161
02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:06.540
<v Speaker 4>the way they're walking around their </v>
<v Speaker 4>apartments,</v>

3162
02:15:06.541 --> 02:15:11.541
<v Speaker 4>it all looks kind of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you go to 1970 and you look </v>

3163
02:15:11.541 --> 02:15:15.711
<v Speaker 4>at 1970 as opposed to the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant difference in that 30 </v>

3164
02:15:15.711 --> 02:15:17.640
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think that whatever the fuck,</v>

3165
02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean if they're that close to they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made these goddamn robots and then </v>

3166
02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:22.940
<v Speaker 4>30 years later they're the.</v>

3167
02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.490
<v Speaker 4>They're still fairly similar like get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck Outta here.</v>

3168
02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Like 30 years later you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still,</v>

3169
02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.620
<v Speaker 4>you guys are still using ipads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like really?</v>

3170
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:36.830
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you haven't transcended into new </v>

3171
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:39.351
<v Speaker 4>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not walking through artificial </v>

3172
02:15:39.351 --> 02:15:39.351
<v Speaker 4>black holes that you make with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>blender now.</v>

3173
02:15:39.351 --> 02:15:43.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean 30 years from now someone could </v>
<v Speaker 4>create some mind numbing world changing </v>

3174
02:15:44.401 --> 02:15:46.410
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just going to be a robot.</v>

3175
02:15:46.411 --> 02:15:49.950
<v Speaker 4>You can fuck or shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's going to probably be over.</v>

3176
02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:54.980
<v Speaker 4>That's the only like suspension of </v>
<v Speaker 4>disbelief thing that fucks with me is </v>

3177
02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:57.831
<v Speaker 4>that they've been doing that park for 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years after watching it and having </v>

3178
02:15:57.831 --> 02:16:02.330
<v Speaker 4>theories on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be like maybe that's all </v>

3179
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.840
<v Speaker 4>they've shown us so far is that might </v>
<v Speaker 4>not be the actual you here.</v>

3180
02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:07.500
<v Speaker 4>My theory is that how come when a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoiler alert,</v>

3181
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.100
<v Speaker 4>if you cut them open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the robot parts,</v>

3182
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:16.160
<v Speaker 4>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you're building them now know </v>

3183
02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.800
<v Speaker 4>when one's were murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he murked all those people and </v>

3184
02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:18.800
<v Speaker 4>chopped them all up.</v>

3185
02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Remember that there was a scene that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see like robot parts sticking out of </v>

3186
02:16:22.190 --> 02:16:26.001
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all laying down the whole </v>

3187
02:16:26.001 --> 02:16:29.300
<v Speaker 4>ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remembers seeing the inside of the </v>

3188
02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:29.300
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chick,</v>

3189
02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:29.300
<v Speaker 4>I forget who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

3190
02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 4>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3191
02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:34.770
<v Speaker 4>there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you watch them construct the </v>

3192
02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:34.770
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see any of that stuff.</v>

3193
02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:35.940
<v Speaker 4>You see synthetic bone or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3194
02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 4>So what the fuck is going on Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3195
02:16:38.921 --> 02:16:43.921
<v Speaker 4>If you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that last scene where they show the </v>

3196
02:16:43.921 --> 02:16:43.921
<v Speaker 4>girl's arm ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3197
02:16:43.921 --> 02:16:44.500
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to read band dominus.</v>

3198
02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 4>They're not gonna do season two until </v>
<v Speaker 4>2018 as well.</v>

3199
02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:52.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have announced that they're going </v>

3200
02:16:52.591 --> 02:16:52.591
<v Speaker 4>to do it and I probably have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 2017 now.</v>

3201
02:16:52.591 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 4>Basically they have to fill that by </v>
<v Speaker 4>2018.</v>

3202
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:56.680
<v Speaker 4>You think Bert would still be fat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent?</v>

3203
02:16:56.890 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really committed to this.</v>

3204
02:16:59.170 --> 02:16:59.950
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3205
02:16:59.970 --> 02:17:02.860
<v Speaker 4>he's a guy with feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know and I love him.</v>

3206
02:17:03.010 --> 02:17:08.010
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would do anything for that guy if you </v>

3207
02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:08.490
<v Speaker 4>can get inside his head and change him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.270
<v Speaker 4>What'd you stop getting them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop Drinking?</v>

3209
02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:11.040
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3210
02:17:13.510 --> 02:17:15.970
<v Speaker 4>What about after January third?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not.</v>

3211
02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:17.500
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want them to be happy.</v>

3212
02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 4>The only way he'll be happy if he keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking.</v>

3213
02:17:19.510 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe with new technology,</v>

3214
02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:24.610
<v Speaker 4>they'll figure out a way to fix your </v>
<v Speaker 4>liver.</v>

3215
02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:28.510
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'll will have like a stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 4>liver cleanse and they'll just pump that</v>

3216
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:30.370
<v Speaker 4>shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm way,</v>

3217
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.350
<v Speaker 4>way into the burden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then future,</v>

3218
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:37.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll do something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe burt will have to drink more </v>

3219
02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:39.520
<v Speaker 4>because it's liver will be so good that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the booze won't last.</v>

3220
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're up in like 20 minutes.</v>

3221
02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Fucking partying harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fun guy to party with.</v>

3222
02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen him do stand out with</v>

3223
02:17:46.151 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 4>a shirt on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3224
02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Back in the times I saw him for a while </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

3225
02:17:50.861 --> 02:17:51.790
<v Speaker 4>He used.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to do it.</v>

3226
02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:56.020
<v Speaker 4>He only started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like about two years ago,</v>

3227
02:17:56.021 --> 02:18:01.021
<v Speaker 4>maybe three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's fairly recent in the </v>

3228
02:18:01.021 --> 02:18:02.500
<v Speaker 4>time that I've known him and seeing him </v>
<v Speaker 4>just stand up and um,</v>

3229
02:18:02.501 --> 02:18:04.840
<v Speaker 4>and I think it was since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen him do standup with a</v>

3230
02:18:04.841 --> 02:18:05.590
<v Speaker 4>shirt on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3231
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I haven't either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3232
02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:07.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3233
02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:08.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3234
02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 4>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like part of the persona,</v>

3235
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:11.680
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3236
02:18:11.681 --> 02:18:14.230
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget when he did news to dude.</v>

3237
02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Was he bigger than you or is it just me?</v>

3238
02:18:20.310 --> 02:18:21.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3239
02:18:21.071 --> 02:18:22.030

<v Speaker 4>we're about the same.</v>

3240
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:27.370
<v Speaker 4>About the same size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does his pants stay right above his </v>

3241
02:18:27.370 --> 02:18:28.600
<v Speaker 4>dick like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems impossible.</v>

3242
02:18:28.601 --> 02:18:32.650
<v Speaker 4>It seems like belt is about right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3243
02:18:32.651 --> 02:18:37.651
<v Speaker 4>But that's different.</v>

3254
02:18:56.141 --> 02:18:58.780
<v Speaker 4>it does look like Brian can tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say I'm looking at Eddie.</v>

3255
02:18:58.850 --> 02:18:59.800

3353
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:45.720
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I do do it as I feel it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's good for brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of other things.</v>

02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:34.070
<v Speaker 5>But to me caution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>err on the side of caution with uh,</v>

3396
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:39.130
<v Speaker 5>with the mct oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe just a couple of tablespoons full </v>

3397
02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:39.130
<v Speaker 5>of fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3398
02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:41.580
<v Speaker 5>like there's this restaurant that used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go to on the east side,</v>

3399
02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Don Felix Peruvian place and they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>make this dish called Palo,</v>

3400
02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:51.320
<v Speaker 5>which is so hard for that.</v>

3401
02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like you should be on Narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3402
02:24:52.921 --> 02:24:57.921
<v Speaker 5>It's a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking traditional Peruvian </v>

3403
02:24:57.921 --> 02:24:57.921
<v Speaker 5>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which meat?</v>

3404
02:24:57.921 --> 02:24:58.420
<v Speaker 5>Potato,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like chopped up fries.</v>

3405
02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.570
<v Speaker 5>Basically tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rice.</v>

3406
02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:04.470
<v Speaker 5>But they would oil like make it on a pan</v>
<v Speaker 5>with lots of oil.</v>

3407
02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:09.030
<v Speaker 5>I used to be able to fart song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like with total control,</v>

3408
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be like bro,</v>

3409
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.550
<v Speaker 5>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bro,</v>

3410
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:11.350
<v Speaker 5>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

3411
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:16.110
<v Speaker 5>Because of so much oil in my system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably really good for you.</v>

3412
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you gotta.</v>

3413
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:22.670
<v Speaker 5>Try this man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take it to this place if you want </v>

3414
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:24.741
<v Speaker 5>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that article that was </v>

3415
02:25:24.741 --> 02:25:27.081
<v Speaker 5>released that showed that the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies in the 19 fifties were bing </v>

3416
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:30.460
<v Speaker 5>scientists to report?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3417
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:35.461
<v Speaker 5>It was saturated fat that was causing </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to get sick and have heart </v>

3418
02:25:35.461 --> 02:25:35.461
<v Speaker 5>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't flesh.</v>

3419
02:25:35.461 --> 02:25:38.290
<v Speaker 5>That was the fifties or sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been.</v>

3420
02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:41.200
<v Speaker 5>We've been saying that ever since,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so 50 years ago,</v>

3421
02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 5>someone lied.</v>

3422
02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.640
<v Speaker 5>Look at that in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy because all these years </v>

3423
02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.600
<v Speaker 5>people have like automatically connected</v>
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and heart disease,</v>

3424
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat and all these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's,</v>

3425
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:59.210
<v Speaker 5>there's like a need that your body has </v>
<v Speaker 5>for saturated fat.</v>

3426
02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:03.520
<v Speaker 5>A lot of these scientists that did this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just fucking lied.</v>

3427
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:09.090
<v Speaker 5>They were paid off by the sugar industry</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make it seem like saturated fat was </v>

3428
02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:10.420
<v Speaker 5>what's fucking people up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3429
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:13.090
<v Speaker 5>someone just sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Dr Rhonda.</v>

3430
02:26:13.091 --> 02:26:16.780
<v Speaker 5>Patrick actually just sent me something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an article that,</v>

3431
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:21.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a new study that came out that </v>

3432
02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:24.091
<v Speaker 5>shows that the real problem they think </v>
<v Speaker 5>now with saturated fats is when </v>

3433
02:26:24.551 --> 02:26:28.360
<v Speaker 5>saturated fats are mixed with processed </v>
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>

3434
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:33.930
<v Speaker 5>processed foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And saturated fats together as a </v>

3435
02:26:33.930 --> 02:26:33.930
<v Speaker 5>combination like pos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>processed sugars,</v>

3436
02:26:34.330 --> 02:26:39.330
<v Speaker 5>and things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and mixed with saturated fats can be </v>

3437
02:26:39.330 --> 02:26:39.330
<v Speaker 5>very bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3438
02:26:39.330 --> 02:26:43.150
<v Speaker 5>So it's just you can go on the fat kick </v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't mix it with that sugar.</v>

3439
02:26:43.210 --> 02:26:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But even when we were talking about this</v>

3440
02:26:44.531 --> 02:26:49.531
<v Speaker 5>before the podcast or we're.</v>

<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:53.230
<v Speaker 4>we have this much too nice a studio for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for where we're doing our part show.</v>

3576
02:31:53.850 --> 02:31:56.700
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys have the kind of internet </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you could stream at a high level?</v>

3577
02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3578
02:31:57.661 --> 02:31:58.580
<v Speaker 4>If we went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3579
02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>

3580
02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:00.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went hardwire.</v>

3581
02:32:00.690 --> 02:32:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could do that.</v>

3582
02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:01.830
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3583
02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some benefit to that,</v>

3584
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:07.920
<v Speaker 4>like there's a benefit to that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything is getting wacky.</v>

3585
02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3586
02:32:08.911 --> 02:32:11.730
<v Speaker 4>in the world maybe you want to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:17.120
<v Speaker 4>Like Duncan and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once we streamed the president </v>

3588
02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:17.840
<v Speaker 4>addressing the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you still do ustream?</v>

3589
02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:20.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just do youtube.</v>

3590
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.750
<v Speaker 4>We're doing youtube right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Youtube live?</v>

3591
02:32:21.810 --> 02:32:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3592
02:32:22.410 --> 02:32:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just more versatile and it didn't</v>

3593
02:32:25.711 --> 02:32:26.730
<v Speaker 4>mess up as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We hit,</v>

3594
02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:28.320
<v Speaker 4>we had problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3595
02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:30.650
<v Speaker 4>But I think ustream is better now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

3596
02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:31.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always up,</v>

3597
02:32:31.810 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upgrading.</v>

3598
02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:35.250
<v Speaker 4>And it was great though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's still,</v>

3599
02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:37.800
<v Speaker 4>it allowed us to do this in the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

3600
02:32:37.801 --> 02:32:42.801
<v Speaker 4>but also it's just a president for more </v>
<v Speaker 4>used by people.</v>

3601
02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we watched,</v>

3602
02:32:45.771 --> 02:32:47.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president talk about Syria,</v>

3603
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:52.670
<v Speaker 4>like Duncan and I watched it live and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about it live while it was </v>

3604
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.890
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a fight companion.</v>

3605
02:32:52.890 --> 02:32:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Presidential address.</v>

3606
02:32:54.900 --> 02:32:57.750
<v Speaker 4>And it was just real weird man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Viken pains are massive.</v>

3607
02:32:57.751 --> 02:32:59.010
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If those go nuts,</v>

3608
02:32:59.790 --> 02:33:00.830
<v Speaker 4>those are fun as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3609
02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:02.280
<v Speaker 4>This is a really fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3610
02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.310
<v Speaker 4>But every time we do them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo gets drunk and wants to talk</v>

3611
02:33:05.311 --> 02:33:08.220
<v Speaker 4>about the Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like half the fun of it.</v>

3612
02:33:08.221 --> 02:33:10.890
<v Speaker 4>The conversation goes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The conversation goes everywhere.</v>

3613
02:33:10.891 --> 02:33:13.650
<v Speaker 4>But Eddie Bravo will always bring it </v>
<v Speaker 4>around to conspiracy theories.</v>

3614
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:15.810
<v Speaker 4>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he still onto the chem trails?</v>

3615
02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:16.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3616
02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Aerosol spraying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spraying,</v>

3617
02:33:19.650 --> 02:33:20.340
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3618
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 4>it's probably been done somewhere at one</v>
<v Speaker 4>point in time for sure.</v>

3619
02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>

3620
02:33:25.770 --> 02:33:28.290
<v Speaker 4>someone went on a plane and dumped some </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit out of the plane.</v>

3621
02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

3622
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:34.940
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government's done it somewhere for </v>

3623
02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:34.940
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

3624
02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:39.380
<v Speaker 4>There's probably some evil agency </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere that has decided to fucking </v>

3625
02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:41.020
<v Speaker 4>test out some shit on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

3626
02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:43.890
<v Speaker 4>And there's been stuff that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>proven that's been done,</v>

3627
02:33:43.891 --> 02:33:48.891
<v Speaker 4>like I want to say it was either Detroit</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Chicago,</v>

3628
02:33:50.071 --> 02:33:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

3629
02:33:51.811 --> 02:33:56.811
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sprayed some particles that they </v>

3630
02:33:56.811 --> 02:34:00.291
<v Speaker 4>could track,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sprayed into the air and the city </v>

3631
02:34:00.291 --> 02:34:00.291
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3632
02:34:00.291 --> 02:34:05.090
<v Speaker 4>determine what kind of impact a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a dirty bomb.</v>

3633
02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

3634
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Allowed biological warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something along those lines.</v>

3635
02:34:10.260 --> 02:34:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Either a nuclear nuclear fallout or </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological warfare,</v>

3636
02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:16.390
<v Speaker 4>like how far it would travel given like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of wind.</v>

3637
02:34:16.391 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 4>So I think they actually like use</v>

3638
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 5>giant fans and shit and blew some stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>in there and then tracked it.</v>

3639
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:24.430
<v Speaker 5>But let's see how many people get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did that though they didn't,</v>

3640
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:25.000
<v Speaker 5>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they?</v>

3641
02:34:25.001 --> 02:34:25.410
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3642
02:34:25.411 --> 02:34:25.750
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3643
02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:28.780
<v Speaker 5>That's where the misconception is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what they did was a truck,</v>

3644
02:34:28.930 --> 02:34:32.650
<v Speaker 5>they used a trackable particle because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to figure out how much.</v>

3645
02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:37.920
<v Speaker 5>The only way to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say the wind is blowing 20 miles </v>

3646
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:40.741
<v Speaker 5>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some shake gets blown up 200 miles or </v>

3647
02:34:40.741 --> 02:34:43.120
<v Speaker 5>200 feet rather above the buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How far is it going to spread?</v>

3648
02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:45.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're looking at that,</v>

3649
02:34:45.310 --> 02:34:47.380
<v Speaker 5>the only way to tell us to try out </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

3650
02:34:47.381 --> 02:34:52.381
<v Speaker 5>So they took some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like a reflective </v>

3651
02:34:52.381 --> 02:34:52.960
<v Speaker 5>particle or traceable particle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So conspiracy theories,</v>

3652
02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:58.350
<v Speaker 5>theories always pointed that as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>like proof that they have done that on </v>

3653
02:34:58.350 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 5>innocent people.</v>

3654
02:34:58.440 --> 02:34:59.560
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which they definitely did.</v>

3655
02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:04.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what happened to those </v>

3656
02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:06.031
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she had happens to people all the </v>

3657
02:35:06.031 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're too close to this or too close</v>

3658
02:35:06.311 --> 02:35:07.780
<v Speaker 5>to that and then they find out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

3659
02:35:07.781 --> 02:35:08.850
<v Speaker 5>that kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turns out,</v>

3660
02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:10.840
<v Speaker 5>turns out you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3661
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 5>Unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turns out you can't eat paint.</v>

3662
02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:15.750
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people do dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3663
02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3664
02:35:16.811 --> 02:35:21.811
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that video I put up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that kid doing the fucking front flip </v>

3665
02:35:21.811 --> 02:35:24.420
<v Speaker 5>over this gigantic overpass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw you have some dude on top of a </v>

3666
02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:25.540
<v Speaker 5>building doing retarded shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done though.</v>

3667
02:35:25.570 --> 02:35:27.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean I put those up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put them up every time I can,</v>

3668
02:35:27.521 --> 02:35:31.360
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I posted this one of this fucking kid.</v>

3669
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:36.510
<v Speaker 5>He goes running up to the side of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>edge and then flips over this impossible</v>

3670
02:35:36.971 --> 02:35:38.170
<v Speaker 5>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3671

<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3674
02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:49.360

<v Speaker 5>Don't look at them.</v>

3675
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.750
<v Speaker 5>Do it</v>

3676
02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:59.320

<v Speaker 5>He did a front flip over a and that's </v>

3677
02:35:59.320 --> 02:35:59.320
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hit that concrete.</v>

3679
02:36:01.101 --> 02:36:02.460

<v Speaker 5>That's dead.</v>

3680
02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Fuck me man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These kids are crazy.</v>

3681
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:11.950
<v Speaker 5>They're doing the nuttiest shit lately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like white people are trying to </v>

3682
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:12.380
<v Speaker 5>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying.</v>

3683
02:36:12.410 --> 02:36:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are trying to trying to get like </v>

3684
02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:19.510
<v Speaker 5>crazier and fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

3685

<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3686
02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:26.341
<v Speaker 5>People are doing ridiculous things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has got the numbers blacks have there </v>

3687
02:36:26.341 --> 02:36:30.310
<v Speaker 5>because this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's riding a rail over the side of a </v>

3688
02:36:30.310 --> 02:36:32.960
<v Speaker 5>bridge and the wind is blowing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a bike.</v>

3689
02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:39.140
<v Speaker 5>Why in the fuck is going through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind while you are risking certain death</v>

3690
02:36:40.041 --> 02:36:42.860
<v Speaker 5>just slightly to the left of you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're writing on it.</v>

3691
02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:45.140
<v Speaker 5>What does that three inches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How wide is that?</v>

3692
02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Three inches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>About size of your Dick and about three </v>

3693
02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:50.260
<v Speaker 5>inches.</v>

3694
02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:50.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm aware of to in Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3695
02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.080
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely thinner.</v>

3696
02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:56.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm thin and curly like a duck stick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man Goes around and around.</v>

3697
02:36:57.770 --> 02:36:59.520
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen a domestic?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3698
02:36:59.770 --> 02:37:01.010
<v Speaker 5>haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I've seen the pigs.</v>

3699
02:37:01.011 --> 02:37:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Dick Ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ducks.</v>

3700
02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:06.080
<v Speaker 5>My friend Andrea is Antonopoulos is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin expert.</v>

3701
02:37:06.081 --> 02:37:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Explained to me about Duck Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gave me slightly wrong information.</v>

3702
02:37:09.201 --> 02:37:14.201
<v Speaker 5>He said there were like four feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turns out they are about 13 inches </v>

3703
02:37:14.201 --> 02:37:14.201
<v Speaker 5>long now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big old Dick.</v>

3704
02:37:14.201 --> 02:37:15.050
<v Speaker 5>Big Hog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3705
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:20.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have these crazy dicks and their </v>

3706
02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:20.510
<v Speaker 5>dicks or like when they extended out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there like almost as long as their body.</v>

3707
02:37:20.511 --> 02:37:22.820
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these ducks,</v>

3708
02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:27.880
<v Speaker 5>they're dicks are twisty and the female </v>
<v Speaker 5>duck's vagina is like a fucking twisty </v>

3709
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:29.330
<v Speaker 5>mountain road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3710
02:37:29.331 --> 02:37:34.331
<v Speaker 5>he's gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find a way in tick in there and the </v>

3711
02:37:34.331 --> 02:37:34.730
<v Speaker 5>female can let him in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what their Dick looks like.</v>

3712
02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3713
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:37.580
<v Speaker 5>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously with no duck,</v>

3714
02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:43.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a homeless stick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I believe that not </v>

3715
02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:45.480
<v Speaker 5>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pictures of these ducks that,</v>

3716
02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:46.730
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a little bit.</v>

3717
02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:51.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little bit exaggerated because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an illustration that's a real </v>

3718
02:37:51.951 --> 02:37:54.440
<v Speaker 5>delicate corkscrew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one's obviously he's dead,</v>

3719
02:37:54.441 --> 02:37:59.441
<v Speaker 5>so it's probably not hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's this crazy weird thing where </v>

3720
02:37:59.781 --> 02:38:04.781
<v Speaker 5>the male penis has to go through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird kind of twisty turny corridor in </v>

3721
02:38:06.291 --> 02:38:10.190
<v Speaker 5>the female duck and the female doc can </v>
<v Speaker 5>decide to let them in or not.</v>

3722
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:14.580
<v Speaker 5>She just shut them down and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>super rapey like,</v>

3723
02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:16.970
<v Speaker 5>look at that one white one on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other one.</v>

3724
02:38:16.971 --> 02:38:18.020
<v Speaker 5>That one bird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

3725
02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:19.970
<v Speaker 5>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do.</v>

3726
02:38:19.971 --> 02:38:21.460
<v Speaker 5>They just jack each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3727
02:38:21.461 --> 02:38:26.461
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he's talking shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's right over here and we can look at </v>

3728
02:38:26.461 --> 02:38:26.461
<v Speaker 5>them and we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3729
02:38:26.461 --> 02:38:26.660
<v Speaker 5>that's rude.</v>

3730
02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:31.720
<v Speaker 5>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we stop and pause and realize </v>

3731
02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:35.800
<v Speaker 5>this is the same fucking kind of animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we just saw swooped down and Jack </v>

3732
02:38:36.061 --> 02:38:37.970
<v Speaker 5>that other fucking bird right out of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tree.</v>

3733
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:41.580
<v Speaker 5>Look what distance do you think he saw </v>
<v Speaker 5>that bird from when he decided I will go</v>

3734
02:38:41.581 --> 02:38:43.670
<v Speaker 5>a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could probably see like a mile that</v>

3735
02:38:43.671 --> 02:38:44.360
<v Speaker 5>far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3736
02:38:44.361 --> 02:38:46.340
<v Speaker 5>they probably could see ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>distances.</v>

3737
02:38:46.430 --> 02:38:48.860
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of animals that could see </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous distances.</v>

3738
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:54.460
<v Speaker 5>A Turkey apparently hasn't seen vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They see a Turkey ever looked through </v>

3739
02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:56.080
<v Speaker 5>binoculars like you ever been glass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I have,</v>

3740
02:38:56.081 --> 02:38:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I've glass before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3741
02:38:57.410 --> 02:39:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Well let me give you some glass in </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>

3742
02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:02.020
<v Speaker 5>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your average,</v>

3743
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:07.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the average binoculars had a hunter or </v>

3744
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.030
<v Speaker 5>sportsmen or a birdwatcher will taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>the woods.</v>

3745
02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:10.040
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a bunch of varieties for </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting.</v>

3746
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Usually people either go with like 10 by</v>
<v Speaker 5>42 or eight by 42.</v>

3747
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:19.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like eight times the size and 42 is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the aspect ratio,</v>

3748
02:39:19.251 --> 02:39:24.251
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The width of the image that you're </v>

3749
02:39:24.251 --> 02:39:24.960
<v Speaker 5>looking at a term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a good pair of binoculars,</v>

3750
02:39:24.961 --> 02:39:29.961
<v Speaker 5>just like a 10 by 42.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Turkey naturally sees 20 x.</v>

3751
02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.460
<v Speaker 5>So a Turkey naturally sees 20 times </v>
<v Speaker 5>better than you.</v>

3752
02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:35.630
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3753
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:37.310
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they see in full color.</v>

3754
02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:39.980
<v Speaker 5>So they could see you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they see you,</v>

3755
02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.040
<v Speaker 5>they see you better than you see you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you like literally have to be </v>

3756
02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:45.040
<v Speaker 5>completely covered up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to hunt Turkeys,</v>

3757
02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.930
<v Speaker 5>you have to cover your face up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to cover your hair on that </v>

3758
02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:49.930
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And look right at you.</v>

3759
02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:50.420
<v Speaker 5>They know this person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me get the fuck out of here.</v>

3760
02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:52.730
<v Speaker 5>Like they see you from way off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3761
02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:54.500
<v Speaker 5>Because Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the life of a Turkey.</v>

3762
02:39:54.501 --> 02:39:56.960
<v Speaker 5>So brutal Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most turkeys don't get to be too.</v>

3763
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:58.430
<v Speaker 5>Most of Them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3764
02:39:58.431 --> 02:40:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Most of them that survive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when they're little coyote jack.</v>

3765
02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:04.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that kind of vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Insane vision.</v>

3766
02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:05.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3767
02:40:05.391 --> 02:40:08.000
<v Speaker 5>And saying my vision has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>deteriorating onto.</v>

3768
02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:09.960
<v Speaker 5>I started wearing reading glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me too.</v>

3769
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:11.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's brutal.</v>

3770
02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:12.260
<v Speaker 5>My dad glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3771

<v Speaker 5>I just accepted it.</v>

3772
02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me too.</v>

3773
02:40:15.211 --> 02:40:16.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is what it is.</v>

3774
02:40:16.770 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Apparently there's some exercises that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do to get better at it,</v>

3775
02:40:20.101 --> 02:40:22.890
<v Speaker 5>but I'm so lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't want you to do lasik.</v>

3776
02:40:23.130 --> 02:40:28.130

<v Speaker 5>because lasik doesn't work on soMeone </v>

3777
02:40:28.130 --> 02:40:29.940

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3796
02:41:21.391 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't need it.</v>

3797

<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you had worse vision is </v>

3798
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.110
<v Speaker 5>definitely something we could do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>

3799
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:28.440
<v Speaker 5>like when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like I see you perfectly.</v>

3800

<v Speaker 5>like I'll probably see you a little </v>

3801
02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:35.550
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like let me say a slightly.</v>

3802
02:41:35.770 --> 02:41:38.490
<v Speaker 5>You gotta like a light dullness to you.</v>

3803
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:41.880
<v Speaker 5>I put the personality wise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Personality is amazing.</v>

3804
02:41:42.410 --> 02:41:43.620
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have been shitting on </v>
<v Speaker 5>you lately.</v>

3805
02:41:43.621 --> 02:41:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3806
02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.160
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the backhand and fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 5>your head competencies.</v>

3807
02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:49.140
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you suck.</v>

3808
02:41:49.170 --> 02:41:50.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree at aLl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're amazing.</v>

3809
02:41:50.671 --> 02:41:51.500
<v Speaker 5>I always had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3810
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:54.620
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck dude?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm up close.</v>

3811
02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:59.660
<v Speaker 5>Big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in it at a distance I could see </v>

3812
02:41:59.660 --> 02:41:59.660
<v Speaker 5>crystal clear like that sign it says on </v>
<v Speaker 5>air,</v>

3813
02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:04.191
<v Speaker 5>I see that it's very sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I look at things like on my </v>

3814
02:42:04.191 --> 02:42:05.250
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same way man breeding computer that used</v>

3815
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:07.890
<v Speaker 5>to be able to read it perfectly snuck up</v>
<v Speaker 5>on me,</v>

3816
02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:12.891
<v Speaker 5>man snuck up on me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people say it's from staring at </v>

3817
02:42:12.891 --> 02:42:15.141
<v Speaker 5>screens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people say it's just a function of </v>

3818
02:42:15.141 --> 02:42:15.141
<v Speaker 5>being older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3819
02:42:15.141 --> 02:42:16.260
<v Speaker 5>some people say that it is a combination</v>
<v Speaker 5>of factors,</v>

3820
02:42:16.261 --> 02:42:21.261
<v Speaker 5>but also one thing that doesn't help is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we constantly staring at something </v>

3821
02:42:21.261 --> 02:42:21.261
<v Speaker 5>that's a fixed distance.</v>

3822
02:42:21.261 --> 02:42:23.430
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the way some people put it as that.</v>

3823
02:42:23.431 --> 02:42:24.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was the woman?</v>

3824
02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Katie bowman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>katy bowman.</v>

3825
02:42:27.271 --> 02:42:28.550
<v Speaker 5>When she was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she.</v>

3826
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:33.630
<v Speaker 5>She's an expert in human movement and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she believes she's got a lot of pretty </v>

3827
02:42:34.261 --> 02:42:36.120
<v Speaker 5>nutty ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they don't use furniture.</v>

3828
02:42:36.570 --> 02:42:41.570
<v Speaker 5>They sleep on the floor there and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks that like looking at something </v>

3829
02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:45.030
<v Speaker 5>that's like really close distance is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like having a cast for your eyes,</v>

3830
02:42:45.031 --> 02:42:46.710
<v Speaker 5>almost like you need to put your arm in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a cast.</v>

3831
02:42:46.711 --> 02:42:49.110
<v Speaker 5>It atrophies because you're not using it</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right way.</v>

3832
02:42:49.170 --> 02:42:50.710
<v Speaker 5>And we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3833
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:53.580
<v Speaker 5>we've been looking at screens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a bad theory.</v>

3834
02:42:53.581 --> 02:42:58.581
<v Speaker 5>At least doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got super big ones and aubrey and I </v>

3835
02:42:58.581 --> 02:43:01.371
<v Speaker 5>did a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went off on this tangent that's been </v>

3836
02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:03.981
<v Speaker 5>fucking with me ever since we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about screens that if you looked</v>

3837
02:43:04.201 --> 02:43:07.100
<v Speaker 5>at human beings and if you didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything about us and be like,</v>

3838
02:43:07.101 --> 02:43:12.101
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they worshiped the screens because all </v>

3839
02:43:12.101 --> 02:43:12.101
<v Speaker 5>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get up in the morning,</v>

3840
02:43:12.101 --> 02:43:12.310
<v Speaker 5>you check your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you check your email,</v>

3841
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:17.580
<v Speaker 5>you go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you stare at your screen and the </v>

3842
02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:17.580
<v Speaker 5>computer in a cubicle.</v>

3843
02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:17.580
<v Speaker 5>You come home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you watch a little tv,</v>

3844
02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:22.110
<v Speaker 5>you go on the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we're going to go see a flick your </v>

3845
02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:24.391
<v Speaker 5>staring at screens like if something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that didn't understand something that </v>

3846
02:43:24.391 --> 02:43:28.951
<v Speaker 5>didn't understand what what those images</v>
<v Speaker 5>were or didn't care or was trying to </v>

3847
02:43:28.951 --> 02:43:31.780
<v Speaker 5>Judge you based on entirely on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual movement and interaction,</v>

3848
02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:32.800
<v Speaker 5>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>

3849
02:43:32.801 --> 02:43:35.560
<v Speaker 5>they're slave to the screen like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even understand.</v>

3850
02:43:35.710 --> 02:43:37.400
<v Speaker 5>We have to get It in these screens </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled.</v>

3851
02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:42.480
<v Speaker 5>We're slaves to watching these screens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you stop and think about how often </v>

3852
02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:46.720
<v Speaker 5>you spend your time staring at a screen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's significant.</v>

3853
02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:52.100
<v Speaker 5>It's giant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hours and hours of almost </v>

3854
02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:52.100
<v Speaker 5>everybody's life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you read that way,</v>

3855
02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:53.740
<v Speaker 5>it's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really depressing.</v>

3856
02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:58.800
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird because it's not staring at </v>

3857
02:43:58.800 --> 02:43:58.800
<v Speaker 5>the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're watching westworld.</v>

3862
02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:13.320

<v Speaker 5>are interacting with screens to get all </v>

<v Speaker 5>you're looking at my family that he had,</v>

3888
02:45:13.410 --> 02:45:17.300
<v Speaker 5>that kid was looking at me because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid is like the net.</v>

3889
02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:19.400
<v Speaker 5>There's no interaction at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3890
02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:21.880
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're at all bullshit aside,</v>

02:45:21.881 --> 02:45:23.920
<v Speaker 5>when they get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when kids get tired,</v>

3892
02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:29.080

<v Speaker 5>this is what you find to not kill that </v>

3893
02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:29.510
<v Speaker 5>and especially if you want to have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation with,</v>

3894
02:45:29.530 --> 02:45:34.510
<v Speaker 5>it's not a bad thing to occasionally and</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them look at an ipad or play a game.</v>

3895
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:36.040
<v Speaker 5>Like if it's on a plane or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

3896
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:41.100

<v Speaker 5>they like books.</v>

3898
02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just give them a book to read.</v>

3899
02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:49.330
<v Speaker 5>So instead of sitting there playing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>

3900
02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.290
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of mindless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're reading a book which can kind of</v>

3901
02:45:53.291 --> 02:45:55.240
<v Speaker 5>expand their imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3902
02:45:55.410 --> 02:45:57.520
<v Speaker 5>there Is also some arguments against </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3903
02:45:57.521 --> 02:46:01.930
<v Speaker 5>It's mindless because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments about video games that all the</v>

3904
02:46:01.931 --> 02:46:05.590
<v Speaker 5>video games are kind of problematic for </v>
<v Speaker 5>little kids because they do.</v>

3905
02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:09.800
<v Speaker 5>They do just become super addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They also can expand your mind</v>

3906
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:15.040
<v Speaker 4>and they're also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's examples of people that have </v>

3907
02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.521
<v Speaker 4>done tests that have shown that video </v>
<v Speaker 4>games actually can make you smarter </v>

3908
02:46:18.521 --> 02:46:20.090
<v Speaker 4>because they make you constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercising parts of your brain and solve</v>

3909
02:46:20.091 --> 02:46:21.890
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't doubt that at all.</v>

3910
02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

3911
02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:24.230
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't won the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3912
02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:25.810
<v Speaker 4>It depends on the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depends on.</v>

3913
02:46:25.811 --> 02:46:26.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the system.</v>

3914
02:46:26.781 --> 02:46:31.781
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like there's definitely games you </v>

3915
02:46:31.781 --> 02:46:33.701
<v Speaker 4>can play where I feel like there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something going on in your brain when </v>

3916
02:46:33.701 --> 02:46:35.070
<v Speaker 4>you're efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're prolific,</v>

3917
02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.120
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're at a higher level performing in </v>

3918
02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:43.001
<v Speaker 4>that game where if you put somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>slower into the same game,</v>

3919
02:46:44.001 --> 02:46:45.080
<v Speaker 4>they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3920
02:46:45.081 --> 02:46:46.760
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not Moving at that.</v>

3921
02:46:46.761 --> 02:46:51.761
<v Speaker 4>There's a cerTain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that that means you're </v>

3922
02:46:51.761 --> 02:46:54.371
<v Speaker 4>going to be great at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something in your brain </v>

3923
02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:57.190
<v Speaker 4>functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving well to be able to put together </v>

3924
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.770
<v Speaker 4>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to play this game and play it really</v>

3925
02:46:57.771 --> 02:46:58.310
<v Speaker 4>high level.</v>

3926
02:46:58.670 --> 02:47:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that there are people you</v>

3927
02:47:01.161 --> 02:47:01.990
<v Speaker 4>can teach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3928
02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000
<v Speaker 4>have you ever tried to show someone how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to play a game and they just can't get </v>

3929
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.030
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't get it to do it or they don't have</v>

3930
02:47:08.031 --> 02:47:10.140
<v Speaker 4>any desire so they never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3931
02:47:10.430 --> 02:47:13.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've seen people try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think stands out more.</v>

3932
02:47:13.850 --> 02:47:15.660
<v Speaker 4>They just are not good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3933
02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.810
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need a lot more practice,</v>

3934
02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:20.400
<v Speaker 4>whereas some people can just pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3935
02:47:20.401 --> 02:47:25.401
<v Speaker 4>and be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think those people come from a </v>

3936
02:47:25.401 --> 02:47:25.401
<v Speaker 4>world of playing growing up,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Why are you pretending that those </v>

4025
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:49.080

<v Speaker 4>those native americans like that?</v>

4026
02:50:49.650 --> 02:50:54.650
<v Speaker 4>That shit didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even speak the same </v>

4027
02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:54.690
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those original people that landed,</v>

4028
02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:59.980
<v Speaker 4>if you ever read some of the accounts at</v>
<v Speaker 4>christopher columbus is atrocities that </v>

4029
02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:03.351
<v Speaker 4>he committed and I know that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that are appalled by a </v>

4030
02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:06.630
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an outrageous.</v>

4031
02:51:06.631 --> 02:51:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever think about what you learned</v>
<v Speaker 4>in school about thanksgiving?</v>

4032
02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:15.110
<v Speaker 4>How nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made it to have a native american </v>

4033
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.110
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have a columbus day.</v>

4034
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.840
<v Speaker 4>It's really outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4035
02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:21.320
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And thanksgiving they used to be like </v>

4036
02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:21.320
<v Speaker 4>and then this guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you eating alone?</v>

4037
02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Sit over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's how they became best </v>

4038
02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:26.180
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how they taught.</v>

4039
02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:28.320
<v Speaker 4>They taught us in school and they hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>Turkey and then they were like,</v>

4040
02:51:28.350 --> 02:51:30.030
<v Speaker 4>even though you're different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's all hang out.</v>

4041
02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.490
<v Speaker 4>Let me say something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't shooting merriam turkeys.</v>

4042
02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Turkeys didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4043
02:51:34.530 --> 02:51:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Like as soon as the turkeys figured out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck they were doing,</v>

4044
02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:37.860
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

4045
02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:38.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do.</v>

4046
02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:43.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't shoot us like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to fly away over that </v>

4047
02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:43.700
<v Speaker 4>metal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4048
02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:43.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They had those flints and shit.</v>

4050
02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things were inaccurate.</v>

4051
02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Push it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not in the distance.</v>

4052
02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:56.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how far they could shoot </v>

4053
02:51:56.601 --> 02:51:58.011
<v Speaker 4>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were shooting deer most likely </v>

4054
02:51:58.011 --> 02:51:58.011
<v Speaker 4>they were eating deers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4055
02:51:58.050 --> 02:52:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Thanksgiving.</v>

4128
02:54:46.331 --> 02:54:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds like lame to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

4129
02:54:48.761 --> 02:54:50.350
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny as opposed to like,</v>

4130
02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:51.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an older guy is older,</v>

4131
02:54:51.850 --> 02:54:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you ever process that as you age</v>

4132
02:54:55.690 --> 02:54:56.050
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4133
02:54:56.051 --> 02:54:58.480
<v Speaker 1>it's never like a methodical thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4134
02:54:58.810 --> 02:55:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Well I try not to think like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that doesn't seem to have </v>

4135
02:55:03.810 --> 02:55:04.280
<v Speaker 1>upside.</v>

4136
02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems like a very limiting thought </v>

4137
02:55:09.420 --> 02:55:09.420
<v Speaker 5>and there's nothing you can do about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are an older person.</v>

4138
02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:13.400
<v Speaker 5>But to mitigate it was different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To cut that off at the path.</v>

4139
02:55:13.490 --> 02:55:15.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just try to do my best.</v>

4140
02:55:16.310 --> 02:55:19.460
<v Speaker 5>So I feel like if you're living your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and you're in the moment,</v>

4141
02:55:19.490 --> 02:55:24.490
<v Speaker 5>you try and do your best and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna follow that back and forth </v>

4142
02:55:24.490 --> 02:55:28.211
<v Speaker 5>and left and rIght.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna have good days and bad </v>

4143
02:55:28.211 --> 02:55:29.981
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you have a mindset or if </v>

4144
02:55:29.981 --> 02:55:31.610
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to trying to do your best </v>
<v Speaker 5>at something or trying to,</v>

4145
02:55:31.611 --> 02:55:33.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy your life in a,</v>

4146
02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:34.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a balanced,</v>

4147
02:55:34.881 --> 02:55:38.960
<v Speaker 5>happy way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not always super smooth path,</v>

4148
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:43.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of mistakes and hiccups </v>

4149
02:55:43.990 --> 02:55:46.511
<v Speaker 5>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the whole thing is it's about like </v>

4150
02:55:46.511 --> 02:55:46.511
<v Speaker 5>having an idea of what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

4151
02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.640
<v Speaker 5>have an idea of how you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live and how you want to feel and how </v>

4152
02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:54.641
<v Speaker 5>you want to affect people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then sort of like figuring out your </v>

4153
02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:54.641
<v Speaker 5>way through that path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as you keep doing it,</v>

4154
02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:56.000
<v Speaker 5>you keep getting better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4155
02:55:56.750 --> 02:55:59.960
<v Speaker 5>And I think that if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're living your life like that,</v>

4156
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:04.990
<v Speaker 5>if you're trying to make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to make this path through </v>

4157
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:09.640
<v Speaker 5>your existence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will at least leave you in a place </v>

4158
02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:12.500
<v Speaker 5>where your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're constantly trying to have fun and</v>

4159
02:56:12.501 --> 02:56:14.600
<v Speaker 5>you're constantly trying to improve and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you'll get like</v>

4160
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:17.650
<v Speaker 4>feelings out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>

4161
02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:22.860
<v Speaker 4>it's still the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still this strange temporary </v>

4162
02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:26.971
<v Speaker 4>existence where you're awake and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious for a certain amount of time </v>

4163
02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:32.950
<v Speaker 4>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then your unconscious for a certain </v>

4164
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:33.430
<v Speaker 4>amount of time every day and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately going to shut off.</v>

4165
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4166
02:56:34.631 --> 02:56:39.631
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all gonna go down no matter what </v>

4167
02:56:39.631 --> 02:56:42.451
<v Speaker 4>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was looking at these photos of </v>

4168
02:56:42.451 --> 02:56:45.140
<v Speaker 4>like red buttons wound a Jerry Lewis at </v>
<v Speaker 4>these events like uh,</v>

4169
02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:47.870
<v Speaker 4>you could buy a ticket to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4170
02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:50.920
<v Speaker 4>So when they get become undeniably older</v>
<v Speaker 4>comics.</v>

4171
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I saw the audience was all very old </v>

4172
02:56:55.950 --> 02:56:56.440
<v Speaker 4>and I wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wondered like is this a,</v>

4173
02:56:57.130 --> 02:57:02.130
<v Speaker 4>is this a thing that happened at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment like george carlin was 70 and </v>

4174
02:57:03.341 --> 02:57:05.530
<v Speaker 4>still drawing in young guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

4175
02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.780
<v Speaker 4>I understand for other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some women too.</v>

4176
02:57:07.781 --> 02:57:09.190
<v Speaker 4>That's a great counter to it.</v>

4177
02:57:09.250 --> 02:57:11.890
<v Speaker 4>But my thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so is it that those guys,</v>

4178
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:15.400
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop being funny to a certain generation</v>

4179
02:57:15.401 --> 02:57:18.100
<v Speaker 4>or they stopped trying or they just got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4180
02:57:18.130 --> 02:57:19.360
<v Speaker 4>so old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4181
02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.570
<v Speaker 4>it could be a bunch of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be taken care of your health.</v>

4182
02:57:22.630 --> 02:57:25.630
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm touring and working a lot.</v>

4183
02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:28.060
<v Speaker 4>George carlin was touring constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantly.</v>

4184
02:57:28.090 --> 02:57:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4185
02:57:28.890 --> 02:57:30.520
<v Speaker 4>He will put out a whole new hour every </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

4186
02:57:30.730 --> 02:57:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was still really funny at 70,</v>

4187
02:57:33.730 --> 02:57:37.690
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he also had taken on the role of the</v>

4188
02:57:37.691 --> 02:57:39.360
<v Speaker 4>angry curmudgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4189
02:57:39.370 --> 02:57:44.370
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this angry older comic who's also very </v>

4190
02:57:44.370 --> 02:57:46.870
<v Speaker 4>wise and very liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that character.</v>

4191
02:57:46.871 --> 02:57:51.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I love the liberal pretty </v>

4192
02:57:51.871 --> 02:57:54.841
<v Speaker 4>fascinating guy and stayed relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relevant rather to the very end of his </v>

4193
02:57:55.841 --> 02:57:58.960
<v Speaker 4>life and died like I believe in a hotel </v>
<v Speaker 4>room after a show.</v>

4194
02:57:59.520 --> 02:57:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4195
02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I think he died in his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was one of those things.</v>

4196
02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:04.410
<v Speaker 4>And that's hard to crazy diddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4197
02:58:04.411 --> 02:58:07.710
<v Speaker 4>I remember he went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say a santa monica hosPital.</v>

4198
02:58:08.010 --> 02:58:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Well he had um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had uh,</v>

4199
02:58:10.410 --> 02:58:11.850
<v Speaker 4>issues with pills too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4200
02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty forthcoming about that.</v>

4201
02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Some code problems from earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4202
02:58:18.010 --> 02:58:21.360
<v Speaker 4>That all that shit contributes the pills</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the most shocking.</v>

4203
02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:23.310
<v Speaker 4>The way they deteriorate people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4204
02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:27.650
<v Speaker 4>He was so funny at 70 then he was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>funny and I think that,</v>

4205
02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:30.150
<v Speaker 4>that dude was still killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4206
02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:35.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So are you thinking about this now </v>

4207
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.510
<v Speaker 4>because you're a father now and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking you're getting older,</v>

4208
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:38.980
<v Speaker 4>you get into your forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things that um,</v>

4209
02:58:39.210 --> 02:58:40.800
<v Speaker 4>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I actually think is that,</v>

4210
02:58:40.801 --> 02:58:42.870
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll think about that I'll look at,</v>

4211
02:58:43.170 --> 02:58:48.170
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people older than me then one of the </v>

4212
02:58:48.170 --> 02:58:50.991
<v Speaker 4>things that I find inspiring is that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like people at the top of their </v>

4213
02:58:50.991 --> 02:58:54.591
<v Speaker 4>game in stand up right now are </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially all 10 to 15 years older </v>

4214
02:58:55.171 --> 02:58:55.500
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>

4215
02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:57.370
<v Speaker 4>So I fiNd that to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4216
02:58:57.790 --> 02:58:59.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm inspiring thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4217
02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:03.450
<v Speaker 4>like everybody is like late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early fifties,</v>

4218
02:59:03.451 --> 02:59:04.010
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4219
02:59:04.420 --> 02:59:05.700
<v Speaker 4>it just one of those things you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4220
02:59:05.701 --> 02:59:07.830
<v Speaker 4>you can be better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

4221
02:59:07.890 --> 02:59:11.070
<v Speaker 4>you can still do greater things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be funny,</v>

4222
02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Like develop more into your forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I think as a young comic,</v>

4223
02:59:15.540 --> 02:59:17.940
<v Speaker 4>when you're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you hear about is like 10 years,</v>

4224
02:59:17.941 --> 02:59:18.720
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years.</v>

4225
02:59:18.721 --> 02:59:23.721
<v Speaker 4>So you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's must be the place to get to 10 </v>

4226
02:59:23.721 --> 02:59:23.721
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I'm 30,</v>

4227
02:59:23.721 --> 02:59:26.580
<v Speaker 4>that'll be my development.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you realize you can keep working.</v>

4228
02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:27.750
<v Speaker 4>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4229
02:59:27.810 --> 02:59:32.810
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're thinking about the body of </v>

4230
02:59:32.810 --> 02:59:35.661
<v Speaker 4>standing up that's been before you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many great comedians that </v>

4231
02:59:35.661 --> 02:59:36.510
<v Speaker 4>have done so many great cds and dvds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different things.</v>

4232
02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:42.200
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that separates you </v>
<v Speaker 4>from maybe a guy that lived 20 years ago</v>

4233
02:59:42.991 --> 02:59:46.050
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're also like playing off the body of</v>

4234
02:59:46.051 --> 02:59:47.880
<v Speaker 4>work of all these people that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you.</v>

4235
02:59:47.970 --> 02:59:52.250
<v Speaker 4>True because they set this bar right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been inspired by their comedy and</v>

4236
02:59:52.300 --> 02:59:57.300
<v Speaker 4>been inspired by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies and all sorts of different pop </v>

4237
02:59:57.300 --> 02:59:58.600
<v Speaker 4>culture things that just didn't exist 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

4238
02:59:58.601 --> 03:00:00.300
<v Speaker 4>So you have a greater points of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reference.</v>

4239
03:00:00.510 --> 03:00:01.350
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4240
03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think as you get older you have a </v>

4241
03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:06.440
<v Speaker 4>better understanding of all the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at.</v>

4242
03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:10.730
<v Speaker 4>So you might be able to point things out</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as you're in your forties that </v>

4243
03:00:10.730 --> 03:00:14.211
<v Speaker 4>maybe you wouldn't have never even seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in your thirties because </v>

4244
03:00:14.211 --> 03:00:14.211
<v Speaker 4>you're tripping over your own deck and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4245
03:00:14.211 --> 03:00:15.930
<v Speaker 4>being a dumb ass and sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you did.</v>

4246
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Didn't you or understanding of the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>then would embarrass you today.</v>

4247
03:00:21.720 --> 03:00:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Which sometimes it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just for sure for everybody.</v>

4248
03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:26.550
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no doubt about it.</v>

4249
03:00:26.551 --> 03:00:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Unless you were born in the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

4250
03:00:28.171 --> 03:00:29.340
<v Speaker 4>you're a work in progress.</v>

4251
03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.950
<v Speaker 4>If you have any self reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look back and you're like,</v>

4252
03:00:31.980 --> 03:00:36.980
<v Speaker 4>I can't live with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just a matter of getting </v>

4253
03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:40.491
<v Speaker 4>better at life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's aLso nothing wrong with </v>

4254
03:00:40.491 --> 03:00:42.000
<v Speaker 4>being Jerry Lewis or red buttons are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys and just kill,</v>

4255
03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:47.660
<v Speaker 4>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing time when you get older and </v>

4256
03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:49.161
<v Speaker 4>hanging out and just stopping the grind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about that just in the </v>

4257
03:00:49.161 --> 03:00:49.990
<v Speaker 4>shower the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

4258
03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:52.620
<v Speaker 4>I'd seen a picture of that and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4259
03:00:53.100 --> 03:00:55.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be 80 in my fucking red </v>
<v Speaker 4>jacket.</v>

4260
03:00:56.190 --> 03:01:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking know kilroy and I'm to go and </v>

4261
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:05.041
<v Speaker 4>my fans will be like the fans that saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>me 50 years ago and I'll just be in </v>

4262
03:01:05.041 --> 03:01:06.520

<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

4263
03:01:06.890 --> 03:01:11.890
<v Speaker 4>And I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually happy with that thought </v>

4264
03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:11.890
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4265
03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:11.890
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4266
03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't freak on that man.</v>

4267
03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:14.500
<v Speaker 4>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might not even be real.</v>

4268
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:16.900
<v Speaker 4>You might wake up tomorrow exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same age and the,</v>

4269
03:01:16.901 --> 03:01:18.620
<v Speaker 4>you might be programmed with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4270
03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:21.010
<v Speaker 4>intermittent memory that every time you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up,</v>

4271
03:01:21.011 --> 03:01:24.520
<v Speaker 4>you pretend that you have this past that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to get better than.</v>

4272
03:01:24.521 --> 03:01:28.240
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this same day has always been your life.</v>

4273
03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:30.070
<v Speaker 4>How are you fucking with over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again?</v>

4274
03:01:30.071 --> 03:01:31.840
<v Speaker 4>It's everything that's happened other </v>
<v Speaker 4>than this moment.</v>

4275
03:01:31.841 --> 03:01:36.841
<v Speaker 4>This conversation has been bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all just been fiber optically </v>

4276
03:01:36.841 --> 03:01:38.680
<v Speaker 4>implanted into the grain in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ear.</v>

4277
03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:40.690

<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

4278
03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:45.880
<v Speaker 4>This is What happening with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When trump became president,</v>

4279
03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:50.910
<v Speaker 4>and then when kanye west was a fresh </v>
<v Speaker 4>three or four days out of the loony bin </v>

03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Not like I'm the president and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

4284
03:01:55.211 --> 03:01:59.080

<v Speaker 4>I love friendship.</v>

4287
03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:07.140
<v Speaker 4>Trump said he doesn't read the daily </v>
<v Speaker 4>presidential briefings because you </v>

4288
03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:07.140
<v Speaker 4>probably shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a genius.</v>

4289
03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:11.980
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck does he need a daily </v>

4290
03:02:11.980 --> 03:02:11.980
<v Speaker 4>presidential briefings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our president of folks,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

4298
03:02:24.470 --> 03:02:26.660
<v Speaker 4>One problem with that dude is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets real upset.</v>

4301

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4302
03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:31.810
<v Speaker 4>This kind of lighten up can be a long </v>

<v Speaker 4>And Jeff Ross had a conversation with </v>

4306
03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:43.380
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like you're not laughing along.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He gets it.</v>

4315
03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Nothing is unreceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he sees this side out,</v>

4316
03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:57.220
<v Speaker 4>live one's going to be rough.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I just thought it was too over the top.</v>

4328
03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:28.870
<v Speaker 4>That's not how people would behave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking stage play.</v>

<v Speaker 4>find.</v>

4331

<v Speaker 4>It's not our show.</v>

4335
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:44.110
<v Speaker 4>He should have been big right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not what we're looking for.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4399
03:06:04.180 --> 03:06:05.900
<v Speaker 4>It was the kind of conversation you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>With six year olds.</v>

4400
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4401
03:06:06.770 --> 03:06:11.770

4402
03:06:11.770 --> 03:06:14.920
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she doesn't want to listen to her </v>

4403
03:06:14.920 --> 03:06:15.070
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

4404
03:06:15.380 --> 03:06:19.310
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy outrage in kindergarten.</v>

4405
03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's their world.</v>

4406
03:06:22.210 --> 03:06:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Know that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that his life,</v>

4407
03:06:24.981 --> 03:06:26.840
<v Speaker 4>you've got to respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's weird.</v>

4408
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:27.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get upset,</v>

4409
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:31.600
<v Speaker 4>they get upset if you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to their wacky stories,</v>

4410
03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:37.880
<v Speaker 4>like the fucking boring story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I've been teaching my </v>

4411
03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:38.420
<v Speaker 4>kids lately is don't repeat punchlines </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over and over again,</v>

4412
03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:43.690
<v Speaker 4>because when they nail punch lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'll say something really </v>

4413
03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:43.690
<v Speaker 4>funny and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

4414
03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:44.120
<v Speaker 4>that's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said it was really.</v>

4415
03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:47.530
<v Speaker 4>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so like,</v>

4416
03:06:47.540 --> 03:06:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm so impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said something that was out fighting.</v>

4417
03:06:49.421 --> 03:06:51.170
<v Speaker 4>It's really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

4418
03:06:51.530 --> 03:06:55.040
<v Speaker 4>if you say it again becomes less funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you say it,</v>

4419
03:06:55.920 --> 03:06:58.950
<v Speaker 4>it gets even less funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every time you repeat it.</v>

4420
03:06:59.070 --> 03:07:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I know it's fun to say something funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to do it,</v>

4421
03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:07.330
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're doing a new show the next </v>

4422
03:07:07.330 --> 03:07:08.940
<v Speaker 4>night in new town kit or the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get that crowd.</v>

4423
03:07:09.090 --> 03:07:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda getting it.</v>

4424
03:07:10.180 --> 03:07:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda getting it.</v>

4425
03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:12.480
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4426
03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:13.980
<v Speaker 4>it's touchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4427
03:07:14.010 --> 03:07:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you don't want to discourage </v>

4428
03:07:19.010 --> 03:07:19.010
<v Speaker 4>anybody from saying something funny and </v>
<v Speaker 4>silly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they make each other laugh all the </v>

4430
03:07:22.100 --> 03:07:22.100
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make me laugh.</v>

4431
03:07:22.100 --> 03:07:25.130
<v Speaker 4>We have these funny conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny having like joke </v>

4432
03:07:25.130 --> 03:07:26.340
<v Speaker 4>conversations where they're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cracking me up and they're eight.</v>

4435
03:07:30.690 --> 03:07:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goofing on stuff is valuable.</v>

4436
03:07:33.370 --> 03:07:38.370
<v Speaker 4>It's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I mean invaluable in terms of </v>

4437
03:07:38.370 --> 03:07:38.450
<v Speaker 4>like social commodity,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when one of them will say something</v>

4439
03:07:40.261 --> 03:07:45.261
<v Speaker 4>funny and we all laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see the little eyes light up </v>

4440
03:07:45.261 --> 03:07:45.261
<v Speaker 4>and then they want to make you laugh </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

4441
03:07:45.261 --> 03:07:50.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also when you find out things </v>

<v Speaker 4>that make people laugh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>daughter was looking at one of those fat</v>
<v Speaker 4>freeze billboards.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

4459
03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:36.080
<v Speaker 4>And then she kicked out that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>lying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's just trying a new thing to make a </v>

4584
03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:17.161
<v Speaker 5>good get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get guys to fight and make a name for </v>

4585
03:13:17.161 --> 03:13:17.161
<v Speaker 5>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's really smart because he figured</v>

4586
03:13:17.161 --> 03:13:21.020
<v Speaker 5>out a way to use social media and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely changed how people thought of</v>

4587
03:13:21.021 --> 03:13:24.440
<v Speaker 5>him because people thought of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>before they knew about his personality.</v>

4588
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:27.800
<v Speaker 5>They just thought he was this killer </v>
<v Speaker 5>boxer even talked about on the podcast.</v>

4589
03:13:27.801 --> 03:13:30.340
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wasn't me because I was like,</v>

4590
03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:32.060
<v Speaker 5>just always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4591
03:13:32.140 --> 03:13:37.140
<v Speaker 5>be in this heavyweight knockout artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's a tough guy.</v>

4592
03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:38.210
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm goofy.</v>

4593
03:13:38.410 --> 03:13:40.610
<v Speaker 5>He was like a goof around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always joking around.</v>

4594
03:13:40.940 --> 03:13:44.000
<v Speaker 5>So you see that in those videos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that there was no other</v>

4595
03:13:44.001 --> 03:13:47.930
<v Speaker 5>way for him to ever show that key magic </v>
<v Speaker 5>hbo came to his house and like,</v>

4596
03:13:47.931 --> 03:13:50.060
<v Speaker 5>we want to watch it will workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go champ,</v>

4597
03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:51.440
<v Speaker 5>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

4598
03:13:51.470 --> 03:13:53.330
<v Speaker 5>cut all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just cut all that out.</v>

4599
03:13:53.331 --> 03:13:55.730
<v Speaker 5>Well then they would learn that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's gonna make it a sensation,</v>

4600
03:13:55.731 --> 03:13:56.920
<v Speaker 5>a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

4601
03:13:56.921 --> 03:13:59.960
<v Speaker 5>I think he had to do it like over and </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over and over again on</v>

4602
03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:03.430
<v Speaker 5>youtube and on instagram for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get addicted to it.</v>

4603
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:07.400
<v Speaker 5>Because now like when I see it in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>feed and it's shannon's sitting in front</v>

4604
03:14:07.401 --> 03:14:09.650
<v Speaker 5>of like a bowl of food or something with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big smile on his face,</v>

4605
03:14:09.690 --> 03:14:11.030
<v Speaker 5>I always click on other videos.</v>

4606
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:12.520
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4607
03:14:13.820 --> 03:14:15.410
<v Speaker 5>it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's who he is.</v>

4608
03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:20.500
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the coolest things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about Your show that you have with you </v>

4609
03:14:20.500 --> 03:14:24.971
<v Speaker 5>and christina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your mom's house is you guys just </v>

4610
03:14:24.971 --> 03:14:27.820
<v Speaker 5>totally genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's 100 percent how you guys are all </v>

4611
03:14:27.820 --> 03:14:27.820
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

4612
03:14:27.820 --> 03:14:28.460
<v Speaker 5>So like that's not available anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

4613
03:14:28.461 --> 03:14:31.430
<v Speaker 5>Like he can tell when something gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>popular,</v>

4614
03:14:31.431 --> 03:14:32.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it gets a fan based.</v>

4615
03:14:32.631 --> 03:14:36.020
<v Speaker 5>It's because people connect to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>authenticity I think of,</v>

4616
03:14:36.090 --> 03:14:37.910
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people's real personalities.</v>

4617
03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely that.</v>

4618
03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:42.170
<v Speaker 5>And there's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

4619
03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:47.060
<v Speaker 5>there's less people from shannon doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4620
03:14:47.270 --> 03:14:50.930
<v Speaker 5>There's almost no filters between him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and People.</v>

4621
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:52.430
<v Speaker 5>There's less people involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4622
03:14:52.580 --> 03:14:57.580
<v Speaker 5>So you could get to see this guy like </v>
<v Speaker 5>who he really is and there's so many </v>

4623
03:14:57.580 --> 03:14:57.580
<v Speaker 5>people like that now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like joey diaz,</v>

03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:52.890
<v Speaker 5>You're going to record things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people see.</v>

4649
03:15:52.891 --> 03:15:56.540
<v Speaker 5>This guy was doing a operation goggles </v>

03:16:10.701 --> 03:16:14.270
<v Speaker 5>wearing these snapchat glasses and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so strange because you're realizing</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4737
03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:32.650

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4739
03:19:33.281 --> 03:19:38.281
<v Speaker 4>rock was probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful guys ever when he was doing </v>

4740
03:19:38.281 --> 03:19:38.281
<v Speaker 4>theaters like those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4741
03:19:38.281 --> 03:19:39.720
<v Speaker 4>not theaters arenas and he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>world tours to.</v>

4742
03:19:39.730 --> 03:19:41.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that he did the hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowl.</v>

4743
03:19:41.470 --> 03:19:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>A lot of money.</v>

4745
03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane amounts of money and it all went </v>

4746
03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:50.350
<v Speaker 4>away to the girl.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so it's called.</v>

4748
03:19:53.260 --> 03:19:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he just paid off a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>chunks.</v>

4749
03:19:55.201 --> 03:19:57.580
<v Speaker 4>We didn't have to pay forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a timeline on it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to know how much money</v>
<v Speaker 4>he paid.</v>

4754
03:20:04.661 --> 03:20:09.661
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so insane that we pretend that if </v>

4755
03:20:09.661 --> 03:20:13.951
<v Speaker 4>two people in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one person makes all the money that </v>

4756
03:20:13.951 --> 03:20:15.640
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another there's an even deal.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the dates?</v>

4762

<v Speaker 4>You want to give specific dates?</v>

4763
03:20:28.570 --> 03:20:33.070
<v Speaker 4>The tool with tommy bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the no teeth,</v>

4764
03:20:33.071 --> 03:20:37.810
<v Speaker 4>no entry tour and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all built shit aside because tommy's not</v>

4765
03:20:37.811 --> 03:20:40.240
<v Speaker 4>in the room right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's new stuff is a little shaky.</v>

4766
03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:42.880
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really funny.</v>

4767
03:20:43.060 --> 03:20:44.260
<v Speaker 4>He made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

4768
03:20:44.500 --> 03:20:46.540
<v Speaker 4>he's got one bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to spoiler alert it,</v>

4769
03:20:46.840 --> 03:20:49.360
<v Speaker 4>but he's got one bit that's like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>intricate.</v>

4770
03:20:49.361 --> 03:20:51.520
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of it I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit,</v>

4771
03:20:51.521 --> 03:20:52.930
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're,</v>

4772
03:20:52.931 --> 03:20:55.750
<v Speaker 4>when you're a funny guy like tom already</v>
<v Speaker 4>is and you're,</v>

4773
03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:01.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're putting out stuff and then you </v>

4774
03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:03.001
<v Speaker 4>have to write new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THe new stuff represents the new level </v>

4775
03:21:03.001 --> 03:21:06.541
<v Speaker 4>of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is us the last throat clearing of </v>

4776
03:21:06.611 --> 03:21:08.710
<v Speaker 4>this show folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promise this is a rough one,</v>

4777
03:21:08.711 --> 03:21:10.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

4778
03:21:10.841 --> 03:21:11.920
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning,</v>

4779
03:21:11.940 --> 03:21:16.940
<v Speaker 4>my throat just did not want to cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was fine until I took one hit of </v>

4780
03:21:17.451 --> 03:21:22.451
<v Speaker 4>weed and then I drank some coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then something about the coffee and the </v>

4781
03:21:22.451 --> 03:21:23.570
<v Speaker 4>weed together just produced this.</v>

4782
03:21:25.100 --> 03:21:29.900
<v Speaker 4>We can't do that right before we go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage or right before I go on the air.</v>

4783
03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Should do it like five minutes before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then do a lot of get that shit out </v>

4784
03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:37.340
<v Speaker 4>of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

4785
03:21:38.050 --> 03:21:40.430
<v Speaker 4>I wish there was a way to solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>

4786
03:21:40.490 --> 03:21:42.190
<v Speaker 4>You can't cough drop or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4787
03:21:42.650 --> 03:21:44.330
<v Speaker 4>That would probably be better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

4788
03:21:44.540 --> 03:21:47.210
<v Speaker 4>But it's better now that we don't do the</v>
<v Speaker 4>butter coffee anymore.</v>

4789
03:21:47.211 --> 03:21:52.211
<v Speaker 4>That was fucking me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too many people were complaining and </v>

4790
03:21:52.211 --> 03:21:54.761
<v Speaker 4>they were right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I took pride and try not to clear my </v>

4791
03:21:54.761 --> 03:21:56.750
<v Speaker 4>throat as much and I still fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

4792
03:21:57.260 --> 03:21:59.660
<v Speaker 4>It's hard out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy tommy bonds.</v>

03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen someone drink so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>water during such a short set.</v>

4811
03:22:41.260 --> 03:22:42.350
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's what you saw.</v>

4814
03:22:46.320 --> 03:22:51.320
<v Speaker 4>And what I recognize is unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just kept drinking and no one said a </v>

4815
03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:52.770
<v Speaker 4>word but a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like if you drank one more</v>

<v Speaker 4>bottled water,</v>

4818
03:22:57.771 --> 03:22:59.150

<v Speaker 4>want to show off the water down,</v>

4819
03:22:59.151 --> 03:23:00.950

<v Speaker 4>fucking around.</v>

<v Speaker 4>flavoring in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's no way you're sleeping eight </v>

4836
03:23:35.861 --> 03:23:35.861
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4838
03:23:35.861 --> 03:23:39.220
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to tell myself like a child to </v>

4839
03:23:39.220 --> 03:23:40.040
<v Speaker 4>not to not do I do that before flight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you don't get 6:00</v>

4840
03:23:40.040 --> 03:23:45.040
<v Speaker 4>AM flight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be walking through the airport </v>

4841
03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:45.040
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4842
03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:45.040

<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>

4843
03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:46.970
<v Speaker 4>So you can sleep on the flight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't do it usually.</v>

4844
03:23:46.971 --> 03:23:49.960
<v Speaker 4>I can't mind my overwhelming urge to </v>
<v Speaker 4>consume more water takes.</v>

4845
03:23:50.100 --> 03:23:51.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a competitive thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4846
03:23:51.711 --> 03:23:56.711
<v Speaker 4>It's also you're putting down numbers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you share these online with people </v>

4847
03:23:56.711 --> 03:23:57.200
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes people will ask like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many,</v>

4848
03:23:57.201 --> 03:23:58.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's your record?</v>

4849
03:23:58.881 --> 03:24:03.881

<v Speaker 4>for these in a day somewhere in the </v>

4850
03:24:03.881 --> 03:24:06.110
<v Speaker 4>fifties and then I know that like gallon</v>
<v Speaker 4>wise it's just over three.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever someone wants to taLk to me </v>

4852
03:24:11.260 --> 03:24:12.701
<v Speaker 4>about people who work out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always use the example of my friend </v>

4853
03:24:12.701 --> 03:24:15.800
<v Speaker 4>cameron hanes to run 205 miles and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly 78 hours.</v>

<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent,</v>

4856
03:24:19.820 --> 03:24:22.490
<v Speaker 4>but in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in an overachiever.</v>

4857
03:24:23.270 --> 03:24:24.350

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
