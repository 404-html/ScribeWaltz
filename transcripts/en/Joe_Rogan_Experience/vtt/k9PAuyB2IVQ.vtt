00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go live</v>

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.250
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.833
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Tom Papa is obviously some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicotine junkie.</v>

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>He's using a knife made out of a nail to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch.</v>

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.123
<v Speaker 1>Open the box so he can get at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigars like Ben Franklin use this knife </v>

7
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>to open up wine and once that's from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pygmies.</v>

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>They made it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at their little handle.</v>

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>My good friend Justin Wren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been on the podcast a few times.</v>

11
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>He's this amazing guy that does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes wells for the pygmies.</v>

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a former UFC fighter knife fights</v>

13
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>for Bella tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the heavyweight division.</v>

15
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:38.394
<v Speaker 1>This big teddy bear of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking nicest guy ever wanted </v>

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

17
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And he goes to the Congo and builds </v>
<v Speaker 1>wells and we've,</v>

18
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>we've helped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cut some people that donate bitcoin,</v>

19
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is worth more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

20
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.823
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to do is take whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth now and just give it to the </v>

21
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Congo people.</v>

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You gotta wait this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to wait.</v>

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>JP Morgan Guide screwed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>

24
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Understand the bitcoin and just make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and down fast.</v>

25
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

26
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>They look beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look luscious.</v>

27
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>

28
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>this is what you offer somebody right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you screw them.</v>

29
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Joe Average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigar,</v>

30
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

31
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you are buying a cigar,</v>

32
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>like let's think about the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you think of.</v>

33
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.864
<v Speaker 1>Smoking cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of like a Jay z type character </v>

34
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>on a yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Looking out over the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

36
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful ocean going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

37
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no denying I'm here.</v>

38
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>He's got a gold rope around his neck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pumped up.</v>

39
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>He's got some champagne or maybe a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martini.</v>

40
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So gentlemen sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go with what the fuck.</v>

41
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

42
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.993
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

43
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

44
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>He wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wins so hard and that's the beauty of</v>

45
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.454
<v Speaker 1>the cigar is eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be in your little crappy yard </v>

46
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and smoking a cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like that.</v>

47
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.673
<v Speaker 1>But here's my thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we associate the cigar with that </v>

48
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about who makes a cigar.</v>

49
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about people who live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny villages,</v>

50
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>they'd get paid almost nothing that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling these things together.</v>

51
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>God bless them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much are they getting paid?</v>

52
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some,</v>

53
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.433
<v Speaker 1>there's some places in Miami where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually go and you can actually </v>

54
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>watch them make cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll roll up cigars.</v>

55
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

56
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is profiting from this?</v>

57
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

58
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:37.764
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whoever owns the big giant tobacco </v>

59
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

60
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>But they need those people that roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

61
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>You do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

62
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>the little guy who rolling the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

63
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>just making a little living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing his little thing he did.</v>

65
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>He can't build the whole tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

66
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.261
<v Speaker 1>corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

67
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:55.094
<v Speaker 1>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially like he's a little </v>

68
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:57.804
<v Speaker 1>worker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be and you meet the Queen </v>

69
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.921
<v Speaker 1>Bee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

70
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

71
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 3>isn't that person a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what we were talking about with </v>

72
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.573
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the comedian is the one who </v>

73
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 3>actually makes the product was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy clubs were getting all the money.</v>

74
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you were in poverty and the comedy </v>

75
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.900
<v Speaker 3>club was balling out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 3>When you feel like this is bullshit.</v>

77
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Yes and no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because in New York,</v>

78
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 4>as you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a big riot,</v>

79
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.800
<v Speaker 4>a big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was like,</v>

80
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.340
<v Speaker 4>these clubs are paying us 20 bucks a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spot that been paying us that forever.</v>

81
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Screw them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make money,</v>

82
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.651
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

83
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:34.921
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

84
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:35.754
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had a hard time with it because I </v>

85
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:40.434
<v Speaker 4>felt like what they're giving us in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place to go and do stand up every night </v>

86
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.373
<v Speaker 4>and have an audience there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The value I was getting from my act was </v>

87
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 4>so much more valuable than the $20 I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting paid.</v>

88
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 4>I didn't care about the 20th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted them to give me a place where I</v>

89
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:58.164
<v Speaker 4>could go work on my act and then take </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to some other city or some other </v>

90
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 4>bigger gig and that's where I would make</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mind.</v>

91
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.250
<v Speaker 4>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

92
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't purely like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screw the man,</v>

93
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.233
<v Speaker 4>the man is giving me a comedy club and </v>
<v Speaker 4>is run this place for 30 years so I can </v>

94
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.780
<v Speaker 4>roll in on a Wednesday and have 200 </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

95
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Well there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's certainly,</v>

96
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I think at different field that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>for places that are,</v>

97
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are an icehouse comedian,</v>

98
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 3>you can essentially have like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>partnership but the ice house,</v>

99
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.290
<v Speaker 3>like I feel like I have a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>partnership with the Ice House.</v>

100
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you,</v>

101
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 4>do you sell it out?</v>

102
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I love that place and I love Bob The</v>

103
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:37.194
<v Speaker 3>guy who owns it and I don't mean a </v>
<v Speaker 3>partnership like I have an ownership in </v>

104
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like there is,</v>

105
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.953
<v Speaker 3>I have a bit of an obligation I think we</v>
<v Speaker 3>all do to perform at the great clubs </v>

106
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.783
<v Speaker 3>just to just to keep them floating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everybody happy and in t because </v>

107
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:53.064
<v Speaker 3>you can and because it's good for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's good for me and it's good for </v>

108
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:57.270
<v Speaker 3>everybody instead of a partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

109
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.133
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the best word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some sort of a inexorable </v>

110
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:04.230
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot separate them</v>

111
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some cities,</v>

112
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hilarity and Cleveland.</v>

113
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that club.</v>

114
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Love the using place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixa greatest guy,</v>

115
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.460

<v Speaker 4>They're also,</v>

116
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like family.</v>

117
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 4>It literally is great people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no interest of going to Cleveland</v>

118
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 4>and playing a theater because if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if everybody comes up and jumps on nick,</v>

119
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 4>then I'd rather draw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend a couple days,</v>

120
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.003
<v Speaker 4>I'll make the same money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much I like that is a </v>

121
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we've had a relationship throughout</v>

122
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 4>the years for me to jump in and seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

123
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 4>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

124
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 4>But there's some other places that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

125
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel like that.</v>

127
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:50.011

<v Speaker 4>house now and fight tonight.</v>

128
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:50.974

<v Speaker 1>I know I do.</v>

207
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.580
<v Speaker 4>I could show it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I think about the cigar though,</v>

208
00:09:21.581 --> 00:09:22.414
<v Speaker 4>I don't think of a Jay Z so much as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a wonderful life like the </v>

209
00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:27.634
<v Speaker 4>banker and that's wonderful line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a box with a cutter in it and </v>

210
00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:31.540
<v Speaker 4>some other bullshit that I bring that </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

211
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.070
<v Speaker 4>I can bite it off if you bite it off </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

212
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I started,</v>

213
00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:40.234
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked in advertising for a little </v>

214
00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:44.830
<v Speaker 4>while and I used to have to go to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>nursing home.</v>

215
00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was small advertising and we would go</v>

216
00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:48.874
<v Speaker 4>to a nursing home and we would do all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ad campaign for this guy who owns </v>

217
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:55.330
<v Speaker 4>like five nursing homes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a really rich guy and he looked a</v>

218
00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:56.164
<v Speaker 4>little like a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like an older guy came up in the </v>

219
00:09:57.851 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 4>war and he used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

220
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.933
<v Speaker 4>first you started with trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he owned nursing homes and he was </v>

221
00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:03.274
<v Speaker 4>just like an old school guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big glasses and he always had a cigar </v>

222
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:06.963
<v Speaker 4>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd walk around with a cigar and his </v>

223
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.870
<v Speaker 4>mouth just chomping on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not what he would just chomp,</v>

224
00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:11.561
<v Speaker 4>chomp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chomp,</v>

225
00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:14.050
<v Speaker 4>it and it would be like kind of scuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end,</v>

226
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.200
<v Speaker 4>but then eventually no cutter at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

227
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.063
<v Speaker 4>He'd been chewing at show long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just spit it out and then light it </v>

228
00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

229
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.853
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.530
<v Speaker 1>What a Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

231
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the other.</v>

232
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:29.284
<v Speaker 1>Combined it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it in the kitchen </v>

233
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.740
<v Speaker 1>doing it already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>just the like the crazy fun drought.</v>

286

<v Speaker 5>point and they want them to put the </v>

290
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how a relationship is supposed to</v>

291
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 5>be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you somehow or another you don't care</v>

292
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 5>about each other because if you care you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get upset.</v>

293
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.083
<v Speaker 5>So very weird sort of dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The man and woman relationship dynamic </v>

294
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 5>of things that people think you </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't,</v>

295
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't expect the way people behave </v>
<v Speaker 5>or don't behave the way they talk to you</v>

296
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.400
<v Speaker 5>or don't talk to you like it's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>

297
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.151
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

298
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 5>It's as if it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If any friendship is the same.</v>

299
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't let,</v>

300
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 5>don't let people be mean to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't let them fucking beat you down.</v>

301
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 5>You'll shit at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some people like if you grow up in a</v>

302
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 5>home that fights all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get used to that and then you.</v>

303
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.040
<v Speaker 5>It's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>

304
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 5>this girl was she fight screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yelling at and like as soon as it was,</v>

305
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 5>it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'd be fine.</v>

306
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 5>Just like I have some coffee and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit there and I'd be shaking like,</v>

307
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.470
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did she say you?</v>

308
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm not good with that kind of tension </v>
<v Speaker 5>that at all.</v>

309
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 5>I used to date this girl would get </v>
<v Speaker 5>really mad,</v>

310
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 5>really mad and want to fight and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>once,</v>

311
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.820
<v Speaker 5>once there was some sort of resolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>should immediately turned docile.</v>

312
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.103
<v Speaker 5>It was very odd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like she'd be aggressive to like start </v>

313
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 5>some sort of altercation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could calm the altercation down,</v>

314
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 5>shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

315
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.773
<v Speaker 5>But you had to almost shut it down by </v>
<v Speaker 5>just saying or you're not going to do </v>

316
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to talk like this.</v>

317
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 5>Like this child was young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

318
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 5>I needed to learn like how to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people or how to manage situations.</v>

319
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes something's happening </v>
<v Speaker 5>between two people,</v>

320
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:49.931
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

321
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're upset about something.</v>

322
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 5>And instead of</v>

323
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking about how you're conveying your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to them,</v>

324
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>all you think of is what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

325
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I want you to shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

326
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Even though you want someone to shut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>

327
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:09.404
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you say that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really thinking about communicating </v>

328
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>with them through their eyes wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone to say shut the fuck up,</v>

329
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:19.754
<v Speaker 1>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we want people to shut the fuck </v>

330
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:23.280
<v Speaker 1>up and you can't deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

331
00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:24.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

332
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Is a point you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care what their needs are.</v>

333
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 1>You just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

334
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:30.224
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also like when people want </v>

335
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>people to do things so they want people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

336
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mindset of you wanting a result.</v>

337
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.323
<v Speaker 1>You want someone to behave a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking about them as like </v>

338
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.363
<v Speaker 1>your equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just another human being and </v>

339
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking like I have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want,</v>

340
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>like what is it that you want?</v>

341
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

342
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 1>what happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we pass?</v>

343
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I find like impasse getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing I'm more aware of your.</v>

344
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>It's that big part of not thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time.</v>

345
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.153
<v Speaker 1>You're always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're young and you're </v>

346
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 1>like coming up and you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just me,</v>

347
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:10.671
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

348
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>me it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just trying to survive.</v>

349
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:12.884
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what you want when </v>

350
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you shut that part down and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person across from you.</v>

351
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it opens up the whole world,</v>

352
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's a difficult thing to learn when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young.</v>

353
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Contradictory to success like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like it's.</v>

354
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like if you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself,</v>

355
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:34.460
<v Speaker 1>no one will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

356
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.294
<v Speaker 1>there's that kind of thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get really good at shit the best </v>

357
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the ironic thing,</v>

358
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to get really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Shit is shutting that voice down.</v>

359
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

360
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Shout it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the voice.</v>

361
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>That voice like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

362
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 1>me and this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want people to listen to me.</v>

363
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.963
<v Speaker 1>Shut that thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you can shut that thing down </v>

364
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:55.664
<v Speaker 1>into more whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you concentrate on it going to work and </v>

365
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>nobody does it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does it perfectly.</v>

366
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that they don't do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

367
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:05.954
<v Speaker 1>It's that you have to constantly reteach</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you have to constantly </v>

368
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>bring yourself back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring yourself back.</v>

369
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.813
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

370
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ongoing exercise.</v>

371
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.893
<v Speaker 1>It really is and that's why it's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this interview with Nate </v>

372
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.213
<v Speaker 1>Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC fighter.</v>

373
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.373
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious and nate was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about watching himself on the ultimate </v>

374
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 1>fighter from 10 years ago and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please shut that shit off.</v>

375
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.843
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody watch a video of yourself from </v>

376
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

377
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.590
<v Speaker 1>shut that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking he's so right.</v>

378
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>That's such an obvious thing like nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to see themselves from a long time</v>

379
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:47.270
<v Speaker 1>ago because we're all a work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>

380
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but when you were in that moment when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that video</v>

381
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.790
<v Speaker 5>was taken of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you thought you had to go and on,</v>

382
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 5>you thought you were doing right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

383
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.303
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now we think we're in the moment </v>

384
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 5>like we're doing fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you were to look back at this,</v>

385
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 5>there'd be something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm upset that the cigar has two bands.</v>

386
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.770
<v Speaker 5>I feel I took the first band off </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately,</v>

387
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 5>dark and go fuck itself because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too fancy.</v>

388
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 5>It's outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am really enjoying to bands.</v>

389
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 5>How about you take the money from one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these bands and pay those dudes?</v>

390
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Roll this mother far such a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm turning comedy as I get older.</v>

391
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.290
<v Speaker 5>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

392
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm shifting.</v>

393
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.250
<v Speaker 5>Red Shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

394
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:22.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

395
00:18:22.841 --> 00:18:23.674
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I shift towards lately more than </v>

396
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 5>anything is like kindness to our fellow </v>
<v Speaker 5>humans.</v>

397
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 5>That is the exact word I have been using</v>
<v Speaker 5>all month.</v>

398
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 5>Act out of kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians,</v>

399
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grocers,</v>

400
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 5>my family.</v>

401
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 5>Just be kind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just be kind.</v>

402
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think the more we recognize that,</v>

403
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.624
<v Speaker 5>the more we see evidence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even an idea even in like groups or you </v>

404
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:51.504
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chunks of people that share our mindset </v>

405
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 5>on other things and we don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>call it,</v>

406
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.713
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to call them out on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say if you're a republican and </v>

407
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.344
<v Speaker 5>there's like some Republican candidate </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something that's running for </v>

408
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:04.404
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're really shady in one way or </v>

409
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 5>the corrupt or what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

410
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to talk about it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a part of your party.</v>

411
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

412
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

413
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

414
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.740
<v Speaker 5>tribalism inside our own civilization is</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking bananas.</v>

415
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.603
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's like the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbing thing of the all the </v>

416
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 5>discourse now is that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>entrenched in these teams.</v>

417
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 5>You're a sucker if you're that in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on any of these teams.</v>

418
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 5>No team is partly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got a flow.</v>

419
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.223
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that's because people were </v>
<v Speaker 5>scared and so they feel like they feel </v>

420
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 5>more comfort in being a part of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>rigid team,</v>

421
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like say if you're a right.</v>

422
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 5>That's what I see in like a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>white supremacists see fear.</v>

423
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.933
<v Speaker 5>You guys were walking in their holdings </v>
<v Speaker 5>flags and there were these torches and </v>

424
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 5>they're yelling things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See fear.</v>

425
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

426
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 5>It's a big part of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're coming for me.</v>

427
00:19:57.391 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 5>They're coming for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're pushing us out.</v>

428
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 5>We're supposed to all be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We looked different.</v>

429
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

430
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.873
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the other differences that we </v>

431
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:06.534
<v Speaker 5>have like left and right and ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 5>and how can you be all in on any </v>

432
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 5>political organization?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how can you,</v>

433
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 5>how it's faith.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>

434
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 5>what's that a Malian on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>team weed.</v>

436
00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.254
<v Speaker 5>You can go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really don't understand it like you </v>

437
00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:27.474
<v Speaker 5>really have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's really upsetting about it is </v>

438
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 5>it goes completely against what we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

439
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 5>Listening to the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really listening to them.</v>

440
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy on my block,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in his garage and my wife was all in on </v>

<v Speaker 4>Stop using that thing,</v>

459
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:25.294
<v Speaker 4>this one isolated thing as to as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>marker for whether or not this person </v>

00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 4>can enter your life in any way.</v>

461
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.863
<v Speaker 3>The only way you should is if that </v>

<v Speaker 3>and make you believe what they believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't support trump,</v>

463
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.760
<v Speaker 3>then they hate you and then then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes.</v>

464
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It's virtually interchangeable with </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

465
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

466
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:44.683
<v Speaker 3>Like if your next door neighbor's a Jew </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy on the other side of you is </v>

467
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:49.004
<v Speaker 3>a baptist and you're an atheist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason why you can't all be </v>

468
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:55.310
<v Speaker 3>great friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great friends hanging out was like,</v>

469
00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

470
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.803
<v Speaker 3>You guys want to come over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do some hot dogs or </v>

471
00:21:58.521 --> 00:22:01.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever that are kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit?</v>

472
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit shit and isn't it more </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective?</v>

473
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Speaker 4>If you are really politically minded and</v>
<v Speaker 4>really want your,</v>

474
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 4>your really love Hillary and you love </v>
<v Speaker 4>what she stood for and you want that,</v>

475
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.313
<v Speaker 4>isn't it more effective to invite this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy into your life and let him see that </v>

476
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 4>he has a lot more in common with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal family.</v>

477
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.563
<v Speaker 4>Sit at the end of the block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then putting up walls and keeping them </v>

478
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:25.910
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

479
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:26.743
<v Speaker 3>I think that people were given a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>disservice by being forced to choose </v>

480
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.073
<v Speaker 3>only on on one side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is Donald Trump and the </v>

481
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:37.330
<v Speaker 3>other one is Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

482
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.040
<v Speaker 3>this like hustle system that they put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

483
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.970
<v Speaker 3>A two party system is the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so difficult because a party has to</v>

484
00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:47.000
<v Speaker 3>choose a candidate you have to vote on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the primaries,</v>

485
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.983
<v Speaker 3>so you have to be registered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that many people are thinking what </v>

486
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.640
<v Speaker 3>the actual numbers of people that vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the primaries.</v>

487
00:22:52.641 --> 00:22:55.190
<v Speaker 3>It's a fraction of the people that vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the general election.</v>

488
00:22:55.191 --> 00:22:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a fraction of the population.</v>

489
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.783
<v Speaker 3>And so if you forced to choose between </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this really lackluster candidate </v>

490
00:23:02.331 --> 00:23:02.931
<v Speaker 3>and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

491
00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:03.764
<v Speaker 3>she had all this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what you think about </v>

492
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Hillary supported her or not you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to look at it objectively and</v>

493
00:23:10.881 --> 00:23:11.450
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

494
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.520
<v Speaker 3>she's a deeply flawed candidate.</v>

495
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a lot of issues.</v>

496
00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:16.154
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of credibility issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't support gay marriage until </v>

497
00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:18.974
<v Speaker 3>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of my big red flag because </v>

498
00:23:22.011 --> 00:23:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how?</v>

499
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care?</v>

500
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Like if you really care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really think,</v>

501
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:28.554
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that gay people </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have the same rights in terms </v>

502
00:23:31.461 --> 00:23:34.640
<v Speaker 3>of like bonding in a relationship than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight person.</v>

503
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy person's idea.</v>

504
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you give a shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make any sense?</v>

505
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.870
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>

506
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.390
<v Speaker 3>there's no proof that marriage is </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting this gigantic burden on our,</v>

507
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.383
<v Speaker 3>on us and why do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you care about how these people </v>

508
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:48.720
<v Speaker 3>live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

509
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.553
<v Speaker 3>why is leave him be so kind to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like when you hear the </v>

510
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:54.494
<v Speaker 3>difference between what Cami said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the investigation and when the results </v>

511
00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:57.914
<v Speaker 3>were versus what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a video where it plays it </v>

512
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:00.614
<v Speaker 3>back to back where she says that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was fine and everything was </v>

513
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 3>no big deal and he was like his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge deal and they like,</v>

514
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>she would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

515
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no evidence of this.</v>

516
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 3>And he said there was evidence of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and multiple occasions and it's like you</v>

517
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 3>look at the two of them back to back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

518
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.184
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people got mad at me for making a </v>

519
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>big deal out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that say,</v>

520
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

521
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.343
<v Speaker 3>you're partially responsible when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you for pointing out all this </v>

522
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

523
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

524
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.023
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not are not responsible for reality </v>

525
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 3>sucking will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes to that,</v>

526
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.673
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is the opposite is don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about it at all and pretend it </v>

527
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:39.030
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem</v>

528
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.863
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all these people being pitted </v>

529
00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 4>against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't see the other side and have a</v>

530
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:48.911
<v Speaker 4>little bit of flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it also has become this.</v>

531
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.713
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like news is entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 4>now when we watch a 24 hour news </v>

532
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:56.054
<v Speaker 4>programs and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like rooting for the bears are </v>

533
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 4>rooting for the steelers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

534
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 4>Like it's become this passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

535
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 4>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertaining sport.</v>

536
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of upsetting,</v>

537
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it's very upsetting that Sean</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hannity Guy.</v>

538
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How has that guy any more different than</v>

539
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.344
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a local football broadcaster who's </v>

540
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.880
<v Speaker 4>really excited about the Patriots?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patriots is Tina asked,</v>

541
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.003
<v Speaker 4>oh my God is going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to be stopped </v>

542
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:24.973
<v Speaker 4>patriots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say what they want about Brady </v>

543
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.970
<v Speaker 4>didn't plate those balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely.</v>

544
00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

545
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 4>he's like a fucking Rah Rah Republican </v>
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>

546
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:33.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

547
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.493
<v Speaker 4>Just like almost like a football guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent all in whatever the </v>

548
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.184
<v Speaker 4>fuck the Republican point is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's all in and you're not going to </v>

549
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 4>convince him to like the New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>giants.</v>

550
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 4>He's a patriots guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just the way it goes.</v>

551
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.043
<v Speaker 4>But I really feel like you got to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through life and rather than thinking </v>

552
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to be too preachy,</v>

553
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 4>but not to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be going by.</v>

554
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 4>My party should be going by the acts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>

555
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 4>So everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>

556
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

557
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.610
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can hate that.</v>

558
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.220
<v Speaker 4>That pruitt is going after public lands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enrolling back all this EPA stuff.</v>

559
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:17.050
<v Speaker 4>And then you see trump or make a deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday with Pelosi and Schumer saying</v>

560
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.583
<v Speaker 4>we're going to try and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these Daca kids are allowed to stay it </v>

561
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 4>through everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

562
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:23.901
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

563
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know,</v>

564
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.373
<v Speaker 4>but I still have to hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Nancy Pelosi's office making a deal </v>

565
00:26:28.701 --> 00:26:29.331
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

566
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 4>that's how you should act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be.</v>

567
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 4>He should be allowed to do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind.</v>

568
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.633
<v Speaker 4>He should be allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be allowed to call him out </v>

569
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 4>when he does something shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be just this blanket.</v>

570
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 4>I love the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what.</v>

571
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Well you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said,</v>

572
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.243
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who the person was that had </v>

573
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.874
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea was that one of the good </v>

574
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.784
<v Speaker 3>things about trump would be that he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with public opinion and so if </v>

575
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.244
<v Speaker 3>he floats an idea out there and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular or it's really damaging public </v>

576
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:02.124
<v Speaker 3>opinion of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll take a second look at which is a </v>

577
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:07.010
<v Speaker 3>very non politician like thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

578
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:07.933
<v Speaker 3>when people point to terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's done in the past almost as </v>

00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>like evidence that he can evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we're fucking doomed.</v>

581
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.530
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doomed.</v>

582
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 3>If human beings and human beings in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>

<v Speaker 3>general right and we're doomed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

584
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 3>If you can't learn at 70 is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it over?</v>

585
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a difference when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

586
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 3>you could figure things out when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

587
00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:30.744
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm better than I was when I was 20 </v>

588
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.280
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get to 70 no,</v>

589
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.150
<v Speaker 3>then it's no.</v>

590
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more learning in like a super</v>

591
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:38.694
<v Speaker 3>extreme scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the president of the free world is </v>

592
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.723
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's the leader of the free </v>

593
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:45.384
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

594
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.980
<v Speaker 3>At 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 70,</v>

595
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.843
<v Speaker 3>and with a bunch of people that hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then talking about like </v>

596
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.383
<v Speaker 3>shipping immigrant kids back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people that were born here when </v>

597
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 3>they were to know there are brought here</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather when they were two,</v>

598
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.580
<v Speaker 3>they were born another country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know the other country at all</v>

599
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.550
<v Speaker 3>and they'll send them back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy scary.</v>

600
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 3>It's very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's scary because it's not.</v>

601
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 3>There's no empathy to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these people are terror.</v>

602
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing if someone is some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a dangerous criminal,</v>

603
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 3>we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>

604
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 3>they should be in fucking jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what jail is for.</v>

605
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Why would you just set them free in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico?</v>

606
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 3>That sounds crazy.</v>

607
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:24.040
<v Speaker 4>And we have this girl in her life who </v>
<v Speaker 4>was born here,</v>

608
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:28.750

<v Speaker 4>gotten her citizenship.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So as soon as they came in and started </v>

610

00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:38.014
<v Speaker 4>She was so nervous just to sleep in her </v>
<v Speaker 4>little apartment somewhere because he </v>

<v Speaker 3>Just grabbing people out of their cars </v>

<v Speaker 3>for no reason.</v>

640
00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:42.090

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.960

<v Speaker 5>Let them Brown Brown.</v>

642
00:29:44.961 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Were you born?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked him where he was born.</v>

643
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 5>We're crazy served in our military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly the same fucking control.</v>

644
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was born in America.</v>

645
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.270
<v Speaker 5>He was absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

646
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.920
<v Speaker 5>but he has to prove that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Approve it because he's Brown and.</v>

647
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 5>But just ask him where.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where did your parents have you?</v>

648
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 5>It's the one thing that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>

649
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't have immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't use that.</v>

650
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

651
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 5>We went right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might be anything with immigration.</v>

652
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 5>My parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my parents,</v>

653
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:16.800
<v Speaker 5>parents were born here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

654
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.763
<v Speaker 5>Native Americans are the only ones who </v>
<v Speaker 5>who were legitimately here long enough </v>

655
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 5>to claim it came across the bering land </v>
<v Speaker 5>bridge from Asia.</v>

656
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:31.930
<v Speaker 5>So for spot it's nobody's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes.</v>

657
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just taking a brown guy.</v>

658
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.133
<v Speaker 5>Right Subaru.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure if you took those guys with </v>

659
00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 5>those officials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to have the same story.</v>

660
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 5>We all came from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

661
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So crazy.</v>

662
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:44.674
<v Speaker 5>This guy's not doing a crime like you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just assuming that he's some sort of an </v>

663
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 5>illegal immigrant because he's at home </v>
<v Speaker 5>depot.</v>

664
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fixes things himself.</v>

665
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 5>He just fucking contract.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can't be an American.</v>

666
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 5>We just throw our shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He still has the fixes TV.</v>

667
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.113
<v Speaker 5>If that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that racial profiling or is that </v>

668
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:09.780
<v Speaker 5>racist?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's more race.</v>

669
00:31:09.781 --> 00:31:10.614
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more racist because look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>racist really means that you are using </v>

670
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.343
<v Speaker 5>power to put people down for the race </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when we say racist is just saying </v>

671
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:21.680
<v Speaker 5>something shitty about somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really.</v>

672
00:31:21.681 --> 00:31:22.514
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's when you really have power over </v>

673
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:26.990
<v Speaker 5>people and use that and that's what that</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

674
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:31.580
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a target and here's the thing,</v>

675
00:31:31.581 --> 00:31:33.710
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe he's right.</v>

676
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.170
<v Speaker 5>Thirty percent of the time that he does </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

677
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.423
<v Speaker 5>maybe that cop does that all the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and catches these guys that are there </v>

678
00:31:40.311 --> 00:31:41.144
<v Speaker 5>that are illegal immigrants and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just there to try to hustle and work on </v>

679
00:31:44.091 --> 00:31:46.790
<v Speaker 5>people's houses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's why we have laws.</v>

680
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.623
<v Speaker 5>It's like exact the guy who a waste </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasted resource unless they're </v>

681
00:31:50.181 --> 00:31:52.070
<v Speaker 5>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're criminals.</v>

682
00:31:52.071 --> 00:31:55.850
<v Speaker 5>While there are people who were fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked at birth,</v>

683
00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.080
<v Speaker 5>at birth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at birth,</v>

684
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.430
<v Speaker 5>that's the way they came,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

685
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.690
<v Speaker 5>They're stuck in some poor country and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out a way to get across the</v>

686
00:32:02.691 --> 00:32:05.450
<v Speaker 5>border illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine?</v>

687
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.493
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine how desperate people </v>
<v Speaker 5>must be in these other countries that </v>

688
00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 5>you would you as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would tell your kids,</v>

689
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.670
<v Speaker 5>go with this man and hopefully get over </v>
<v Speaker 5>to that other country for a better life.</v>

690
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.533
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine how desperate you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have to be to tell your children </v>

691
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.130
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

706
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:10.360
<v Speaker 1>just looking around and we walked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and the lid open.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sitting there with rod shooting out of </v>

714
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 1>their ass all stroking their shaft.</v>

715
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.863
<v Speaker 1>Must Be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be like the number one tool for </v>

716
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 1>masturbation and everybody around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world does it,</v>

717
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not right.</v>

718
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:46.894
<v Speaker 1>The day is not a main thing in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we prefer to do is chop down trees </v>

719
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 1>and make a fine paper that we smear shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>over asshole.</v>

720
00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Walk up and talk about your day with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fecal matter all over the fucking room.</v>

721
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Radically cut down on the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fecal matter available.</v>

722
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>If we just had jets of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the rest of the world.</v>

723
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Just fly it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the rest of you how they do that but</v>

724
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 1>day thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is awkward.</v>

725
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:15.464
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most ergonomic thing ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>created with metal pipe thing is right </v>

726
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 1>where your asshole goes and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere to sit.</v>

727
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems much nastier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time you walk into a hotel and</v>

728
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:28.310
<v Speaker 1>saw that as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>

729
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I'm cleaning or I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

730
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I was in a hotel in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the hotel,</v>

731
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:41.110
<v Speaker 1>but they had some crazy setup where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was not just a bad day,</v>

732
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:42.223
<v Speaker 1>but they had to fucking hoses one on </v>
<v Speaker 1>either side of the bowl when that hard </v>

733
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:49.754
<v Speaker 1>metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to have a day over here </v>

734
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.173
<v Speaker 1>and you got a bath with these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking carwash hoses right next to the </v>

735
00:34:57.831 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How clean the after me.</v>

736
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.673
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just shoot water everywhere </v>

737
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 1>while you're shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with those two?</v>

738
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:06.824
<v Speaker 1>What did you do it in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one the right hand to left </v>

739
00:35:08.891 --> 00:35:12.530
<v Speaker 1>hand and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like cleaning my asshole with my</v>

740
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:14.850
<v Speaker 1>right hand and do it and I have to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

741
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.240
<v Speaker 1>grab this and strangle myself as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaned my,</v>

742
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:18.074
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep my phone and I looked this up </v>

743
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>when that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

744
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>

745
00:35:23.361 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's even better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

746
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It's to clean this shit off the inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the toilet.</v>

747
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.360

<v Speaker 1>not one of them is.</v>

748
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so hard to keep it clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>

749
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 1>You get the second one's for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what one of them is for.</v>

750
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.130

<v Speaker 5>I was having a problem.</v>

780
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 5>My toilet wouldn't flush correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I had a fellow come over to take care</v>

781
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 5>of it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.353
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that was in my bathroom.</v>

784
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.543
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is a tree that's roots got into a </v>

785
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:27.550
<v Speaker 5>small crack in the water pipe and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 5>they continue to grow where the pipe is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crack it and once they crack it,</v>

787
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:36.681
<v Speaker 5>something goes inside and then it grows </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the water up the pipe.</v>

788
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.390
<v Speaker 5>So the pipe was clogged with like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tree.</v>

00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 1>are complaining about Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these fuckers,</v>

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.660
<v Speaker 1>they grow real fast and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay the same size.</v>

831
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.673
<v Speaker 1>They're not hustlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the long game like </v>

832
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

833
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Harry seems happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could he be the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

836
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.700

<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

837
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.053
<v Speaker 1>Could be out there in the dirt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally pick up a little good </v>

838
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.253
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was sad routes that have the story of </v>

840
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.590

<v Speaker 1>they're up above the rest of the roots.</v>

841
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on up there?</v>

842
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Harry.</v>

846
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Harry was a hustler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry is the Jay Z of tree roots.</v>

847
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear how he got busted wide?</v>

850
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.340

<v Speaker 1>I was telling him,</v>

851
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stay small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get too big.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is that is?</v>

854
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is behind the music.</v>

855
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right here.</v>

856
00:40:35.991 --> 00:40:36.824
<v Speaker 1>We got too big.</v>

857
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

858
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 4>he's a goddamn bad company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Song.</v>

859
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.603
<v Speaker 4>He got playing there as when you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on around the world and </v>

860
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 4>these horrible places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

861
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.170
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughters have friends and the sun in</v>

862
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:57.004
<v Speaker 4>the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their parents take them to Haiti or </v>

863
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:00.454
<v Speaker 4>someplace and they work for a week or </v>
<v Speaker 4>two helping build these places and it's </v>

864
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

865
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just like a white,</v>

866
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling good about myself,</v>

867
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.610
<v Speaker 4>kind of a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

868
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 4>And then I go back home and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful people,</v>

869
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.790
<v Speaker 4>but they really do need the help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they really honestly benefit from,</v>

870
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.930
<v Speaker 4>from people coming down and helping them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bring supplies and stuff.</v>

871
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any desire to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every pygmy guy,</v>

872
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to really think that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>through a man.</v>

873
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I think my best</v>

874
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 6>method of helping is just talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hear me about it.</v>

875
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're good at it.</v>

876
00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean donating money.</v>

877
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I don't know,</v>

878
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:49.070
<v Speaker 5>but getting on camera and go sleeping on</v>
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

879
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective thing for me.</v>

880
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's just a cop out on my part.</v>

881
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I should do it</v>

882
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 6>once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>

883
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.640
<v Speaker 6>I think the real issue with all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>different places,</v>

884
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 6>they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's only so much access to growth in</v>

885
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:06.990
<v Speaker 6>certain places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

886
00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 6>like we think of life as being growth </v>
<v Speaker 6>oriented,</v>

887
00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.730
<v Speaker 6>like especially in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in this country.</v>

888
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 6>We think of life not as like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you have enough to eat?</v>

889
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 6>Do you have friends around you that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>care about?</v>

890
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 6>Are you having a good time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't think about it that way.</v>

891
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 6>We think about it as are you constantly </v>
<v Speaker 6>moving forward?</v>

892
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Are you out of the clubs now doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

893
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.230
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the no.</v>

894
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:28.911
<v Speaker 6>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good,</v>

895
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:29.744
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard you guys bought a new house </v>

896
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.553
<v Speaker 6>yammering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dora.</v>

897
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're always moving.</v>

898
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.810
<v Speaker 6>You're always moving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're moving up.</v>

899
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:36.703
<v Speaker 6>You're not always going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas that is just how we mark </v>

900
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.153
<v Speaker 6>success.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas in a lot of cultures that's not </v>

901
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 6>even a part of life.</v>

902
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.973
<v Speaker 6>There is no moving up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can get a job and you can work </v>

903
00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 6>and you were part of this community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do whatever you do,</v>

904
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:52.570
<v Speaker 6>whether you're a fisherman or whether </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a carpenter,</v>

905
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 6>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's it.</v>

906
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 6>You just lived that life and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>their idea of what life is now.</v>

907
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:00.340
<v Speaker 6>Our idea of life is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

908
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 6>get a nice car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a nice house,</v>

909
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 6>got a big TV,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what if there's something past that,</v>

910
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:07.663
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what if some new thing comes along </v>

911
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 6>that makes this idea completely fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous?</v>

912
00:43:12.621 --> 00:43:12.781
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

913
00:43:12.781 --> 00:43:13.614
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get enough credit so you can plug </v>

914
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 6>into the matrix and then we start </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking like that.</v>

915
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:18.284
<v Speaker 6>Like with this idea that the only way </v>
<v Speaker 6>your life could ever be good if you get </v>

916
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 6>a nice new laptop or get a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

917
00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 6>or you live in a nice community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

918
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 6>that seems a little weird because really</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just life.</v>

919
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.003
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

920
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean the bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

921
00:43:33.401 --> 00:43:35.370
<v Speaker 5>and then you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you accumulate more liver.</v>

922
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.920
<v Speaker 5>The problem with it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>accumulate more things and then you,</v>

923
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.173
<v Speaker 5>you're still in that vulnerable feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I got to pay for this and move </v>

924
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.873
<v Speaker 5>forward and get like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get more then then you're with your </v>

925
00:43:48.701 --> 00:43:49.900
<v Speaker 5>friend on his private jet and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

926
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.250
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I don't have that.</v>

927
00:43:51.251 --> 00:43:53.640
<v Speaker 5>I guess I have to keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

928
00:43:53.641 --> 00:43:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then this guy has a yacht.</v>

929
00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got a yacht.</v>

930
00:43:57.191 --> 00:43:59.920
<v Speaker 5>He's got a 59 foot yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one big,</v>

931
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.230
<v Speaker 5>big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 100 hundred and 20 foot.</v>

932
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:03.723
<v Speaker 5>What's a good size yacht?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor put this up to their dad as he </v>

933
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 5>pulled up behind him when he was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging out wherever he is,</v>

934
00:44:09.551 --> 00:44:10.384
<v Speaker 5>but that's a yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started thinking about the problems </v>

935
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.450
<v Speaker 5>you would have if you had this shot.</v>

936
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.300
<v Speaker 5>Like you got to have a security team </v>
<v Speaker 5>because someone's.</v>

937
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.040
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my God,</v>

938
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:18.943
<v Speaker 5>that looks like the death star.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got an opening on the side for a </v>

939
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.840
<v Speaker 5>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole boat can go inside the yacht.</v>

940
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.020
<v Speaker 5>She cited problems you have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you had this shot,</v>

941
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 5>could be even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my looking.</v>

942
00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Where is this space that is maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

943
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.280
<v Speaker 5>Visa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say it.</v>

944
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 5>They say a FIFA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

945
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 5>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell him to put a t h on that bitch.</v>

946
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Now there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

947
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 5>incredible man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

948
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's enough?</v>

949
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:49.550
<v Speaker 5>I guess is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

950
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 5>$360 million dollar yacht and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>

951
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 5>see what $360 million dollar yacht </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking name,</v>

952
00:44:57.211 --> 00:44:58.044
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when you're seeing what are we </v>

953
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:02.844
<v Speaker 5>doing wrong that we don't see that </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting back with a cigar so more </v>

954
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.753
<v Speaker 5>rutgers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to bring back record sales in </v>

955
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 5>a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We looked at the books,</v>

956
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.073
<v Speaker 5>live concerts just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not enough money to charge </v>

957
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.833
<v Speaker 5>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need $390 million to get a slightly </v>

958
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:24.261
<v Speaker 5>larger with a diamond encrusted anchor </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a crew that will</v>

959
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.150
<v Speaker 6>lower it and wipe it off where I pull </v>
<v Speaker 6>the water off when we pull it out of the</v>

960
00:45:31.151 --> 00:45:33.780
<v Speaker 6>water crew of hot white chicks with big </v>
<v Speaker 6>asses.</v>

961
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:38.560
<v Speaker 6>It's only buddy who works there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't hire any third world help.</v>

962
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.013
<v Speaker 6>Hot White chicks.</v>

963
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.913
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's a sickness that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to keep racing or do you feel like </v>

964
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:44.034
<v Speaker 5>it's healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it keeps you making stuff </v>

965
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:47.940
<v Speaker 5>and keeps you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

966
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 5>creating and doing things.</v>

967
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:50.890
<v Speaker 6>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can be either or.</v>

968
00:45:50.891 --> 00:45:51.780
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

969
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.623
<v Speaker 6>it can be a good thing because people </v>
<v Speaker 6>aren't ambitious and don't get things </v>

970
00:45:56.021 --> 00:45:56.854
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times we all know like lazy </v>

971
00:45:58.991 --> 00:45:59.824
<v Speaker 6>guys and their sometimes their family </v>
<v Speaker 6>can suffer because they don't make ends </v>

972
00:46:04.001 --> 00:46:04.834
<v Speaker 6>meet and it's not because of a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunity because they fuck up and </v>

973
00:46:07.661 --> 00:46:10.510
<v Speaker 6>they're lazy and they don't just gear </v>
<v Speaker 6>with it and get together,</v>

974
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:12.303
<v Speaker 6>but at a certain point in time we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely know people that are caught </v>

975
00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:18.010
<v Speaker 6>up in it to the point where that's all </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're concerned with,</v>

976
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 6>they're concerned with is moving up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the numbers and the ladder and the.</v>

977
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not good either.</v>

978
00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.890
<v Speaker 6>So either one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you've defined this band,</v>

979
00:46:26.891 --> 00:46:31.360
<v Speaker 6>comfortable balance as a human being and</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't get swept away by your pursuit.</v>

980
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.790
<v Speaker 6>Pursuit is just something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>engaging in.</v>

981
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.400
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is why like I like to look at.</v>

982
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.650
<v Speaker 6>This is a fucking very hippy way to look</v>
<v Speaker 6>at things,</v>

983
00:46:38.651 --> 00:46:41.590
<v Speaker 6>but I honestly like to look at all my </v>
<v Speaker 6>pursuits,</v>

984
00:46:41.591 --> 00:46:42.424
<v Speaker 6>like everything I do or I try to do as </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that hopefully makes me a </v>

985
00:46:45.671 --> 00:46:49.140
<v Speaker 6>better person is contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is a.</v>

986
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.033
<v Speaker 6>They are in some ways like Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people would think would be </v>

987
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:54.160
<v Speaker 6>contradictory to making you a better </v>
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

988
00:46:54.161 --> 00:46:54.611
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just have.</v>

989
00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 6>They're strangling people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Show me the show.</v>

990
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 6>It seems kind of mean Joe row.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not really what you're doing when</v>

991
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:01.134
<v Speaker 6>you're doing is you're testing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 6>in these extreme situations with other </v>

992
00:47:03.491 --> 00:47:05.830
<v Speaker 6>likeminded people and he developed a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot.</v>

993
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.960
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you develop a keen understanding of your</v>

994
00:47:07.961 --> 00:47:10.150
<v Speaker 6>actual vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

995
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:14.350
<v Speaker 6>because I've been choked out by people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are outweighed by like 30 pounds,</v>

996
00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:15.740
<v Speaker 6>40 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strangling.</v>

997
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for sure man.</v>

998
00:47:16.961 --> 00:47:19.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It happens all the time and I'm decent,</v>

999
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:19.930
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.180
<v Speaker 6>And I get my ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People way smarter than me.</v>

1001
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.460
<v Speaker 6>It's humbling and people bigger than me </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are better than me.</v>

1002
00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:25.294
<v Speaker 6>They just run right through me like I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't exist and I've been doing it a </v>

1003
00:47:27.671 --> 00:47:30.110
<v Speaker 6>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like</v>

1004
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the average person that has this </v>
<v Speaker 3>delusional perspective of who they are,</v>

1005
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.773
<v Speaker 3>you have to face and he also got to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to getting tapped out and getting </v>

1006
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:38.194
<v Speaker 3>used to getting tapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's humbling and it doesn't feel </v>

1007
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:41.794
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to be able to just </v>

1008
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 3>accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a learning thing,</v>

1009
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>like don't get your ego attached to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1010
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.673
<v Speaker 3>The reason why you got tapped out is </v>
<v Speaker 3>your arm is supposed to be here and you </v>

1011
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 3>reached here and you got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't do that anymore.</v>

1012
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Now you know should thank that person </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1013
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 3>for taking advantage of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities you leave.</v>

1014
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.393
<v Speaker 3>Because when you leave these openings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you need to know those openings are </v>

1015
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 3>there because you didn't know it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>there before.</v>

1016
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Next time you won't do this with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm.</v>

1017
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Speaker 3>You'll keep your arm right here like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to do that and you might</v>

1018
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:10.750
<v Speaker 3>still get tapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'll be harder.</v>

1019
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like any,</v>

1020
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 5>anytime you talk about whether it makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>you a good person,</v>

1021
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.003
<v Speaker 5>any kind of a thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what you're talking about is kind </v>

1022
00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:20.354
<v Speaker 5>of similar to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of similar to what you're </v>

1023
00:48:22.391 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like going and helping the pygmy.</v>

1024
00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:24.973
<v Speaker 5>It's all about the common denominator </v>
<v Speaker 5>with all of it is getting your ego out </v>

1025
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 5>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting your ego out of the way.</v>

1026
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 5>And it's a thing is looking at like </v>
<v Speaker 5>really taking some objective time.</v>

1027
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people just keep going.</v>

1028
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 5>They don't ever stop and assess </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

1029
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 5>How could I have done that better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could I have handled this better?</v>

1030
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1031
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real.</v>

1032
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you can get rid of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1033
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1034
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:53.703
<v Speaker 5>the ego and the self and all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize you're a part of something </v>

1035
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 5>larger.</v>

1036
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Like even in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the way you're describing it,</v>

1037
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 5>it's that you're interacting with other </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>

1038
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you just isolated walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>around thinking I'm great.</v>

1039
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:05.883
<v Speaker 5>It's only when you get there with other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that you're kind of learning and </v>

1040
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.230
<v Speaker 5>having that back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

1041
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:13.270
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I honestly think yoga is real similar in</v>

1042
00:49:13.271 --> 00:49:14.104
<v Speaker 5>that way to yoga is very humbling when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you do it together with a group of </v>

1043
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 5>people and everyone's struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1044
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Speaker 5>and there's this brutal and that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1045
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:27.390
<v Speaker 5>you're on the mat next to two tiny girls</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are just doing things that you can't</v>

1046
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:29.590
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're just like,</v>

1047
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's humbling.</v>

1048
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 5>It's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super humbling.</v>

1049
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 5>There's a lady that works out in my yoga</v>
<v Speaker 5>class sometimes she's like in her,</v>

1050

<v Speaker 3>her late fifties and she's jacked dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but also never stopped working out or </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's humbling though.</v>

1063

<v Speaker 3>That's my point is that like it's </v>

<v Speaker 3>enough of us do hard shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puts things in perspective.</v>

1066
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Your mind wants to gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>softness and the couch and the easy road</v>

1084
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:12.944
<v Speaker 3>doing things that make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that believe </v>

1085
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 3>that subsistence living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those folks that live off the land,</v>

1086
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.293
<v Speaker 3>like in villages and they catch fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like a whole setup and then </v>

1087
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.333
<v Speaker 3>not without food they have food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the life essentially is about </v>

1088
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Speaker 3>procuring food.</v>

1089
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not about getting a job at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory somewhere.</v>

1090
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1091
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 3>And then the factory will come along and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden the factory says,</v>

1092
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll pay you $2 a day.</v>

1127
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 3>out and catching fish and hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing your own vegetables and having a</v>

1128
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:17.324
<v Speaker 3>tight knit small community is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit in that is that it hits all the </v>

1129
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 3>old notes that we've had since we </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved,</v>

1130
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the time we were lower primates to </v>

1131
00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:28.104
<v Speaker 3>living in these small clusters of monkey</v>
<v Speaker 3>people living in villages to working </v>

1132
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 3>together and living off the land and </v>

1135
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:41.214
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a technological world is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable for us and is working in </v>

1136
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:46.470
<v Speaker 3>cubicles with fluorescent lighting is so</v>

<v Speaker 4>Patterson,</v>

1142
00:53:58.411 --> 00:53:59.244
<v Speaker 4>these places that were booming and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've kind of fallen off and she </v>

1143
00:54:03.271 --> 00:54:04.104
<v Speaker 4>creates these city gardens in all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these different places and bring young </v>

1144
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 4>students in to sit and work with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth and grow vegetables.</v>

1148
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.990
<v Speaker 4>There's no sense of what you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

1149
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:30.650
<v Speaker 4>They sit in garden and actually smell </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dirt and harvest vegetables and cook</v>

1150
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:31.554
<v Speaker 4>that food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes their life because just what </v>

1151
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:36.840
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what we're supposed to do.</v>

1152
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.730
<v Speaker 4>It's our nature as beasts.</v>

1153
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:41.263
<v Speaker 3>What we're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As much as I'm saying it's what we did </v>

1154
00:54:43.431 --> 00:54:47.840
<v Speaker 3>do for so long that we know it and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups have already been cut almost like</v>

1155
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:48.674
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing now is like you ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to take a screwdriver and a </v>

1156
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.193
<v Speaker 3>screwdriver doesn't quite fit the screw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can kind of make it work and </v>

1157
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.083
<v Speaker 3>when you kind of make it work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of chews up the screw a little </v>

1158
00:55:00.561 --> 00:55:02.330
<v Speaker 3>bit because every time I use a </v>
<v Speaker 3>screwdriver,</v>

1159
00:55:02.331 --> 00:55:07.160
<v Speaker 3>that's a human being in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right slot right in.</v>

1160
00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Now think a human being that's living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the taiga.</v>

1161
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.913
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about groups that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been polished and cut an exact fit for </v>

1162
00:55:14.121 --> 00:55:15.530
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1163
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:19.510
<v Speaker 3>So all their human reward systems for </v>
<v Speaker 3>survival are.</v>

1164
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.473
<v Speaker 3>They're not based on some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological innovation that will move </v>

1165
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:24.254
<v Speaker 3>us towards a world of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and fucking the Internet </v>

1166
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:31.430
<v Speaker 3>going through your brain pumping through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky and Wifi all over the world.</v>

1167
00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Not that their grooves or carved </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently than ours.</v>

1168
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So are good.</v>

1169
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.170
<v Speaker 4>So don't you think your groove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you go out into the woods,</v>

1170
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:40.700
<v Speaker 4>don't you feel</v>

1171
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.740
<v Speaker 3>terrified shouldn't be there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing?</v>

1172
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:43.933
<v Speaker 3>But when you come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you come home and you survived </v>

1173
00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your soul,</v>

1174
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.960
<v Speaker 3>something's happened to your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1176
00:55:51.561 --> 00:55:54.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an either or is my point.</v>

1177
00:55:54.501 --> 00:55:55.334
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1178
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.350
<v Speaker 3>you got to live in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way,</v>

1179
00:55:57.351 --> 00:55:58.580
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be one with nature.</v>

1180
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.301
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1181
00:55:59.301 --> 00:56:01.460
<v Speaker 3>you also should go to a nice restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a city.</v>

1182
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.010
<v Speaker 3>You'll see a comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1183
00:56:04.011 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 3>the very thing that we enjoy most </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching and performing,</v>

1184
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:09.980
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy is all done with electric</v>
<v Speaker 3>lights.</v>

1185
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Shure microphone in a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural environment.</v>

1186
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:14.540
<v Speaker 3>That's air conditioned.</v>

1187
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're dealing with human beings.</v>

1188
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with heartbeats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweat.</v>

1189
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.593
<v Speaker 3>Sure breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need all this technology and </v>

1190
00:56:21.221 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>this is a totally new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's most important thing to us,</v>

1191
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new endeavor for humans.</v>

1192
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.034
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you feel like if you're </v>

1193
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 1>totally disconnected from nature and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just live in that city,</v>

1194
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I know people that don't leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

1195
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not healthy people.</v>

1196
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

1197
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

1198
00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 1>They're like shaky and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next to the battery all the time.</v>

1199
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.740
<v Speaker 1>That is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest Condo,</v>

1200
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One walk,</v>

1201
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.873
<v Speaker 1>one hike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was we would fix their head or </v>

1202
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you can see the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1203
00:56:53.531 --> 00:56:54.364
<v Speaker 1>I think you can be completely healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being some fucking business person </v>

1204
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 1>that's out there kicking ass and taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>

1205
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Possible.</v>

1206
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:04.503
<v Speaker 1>I think every time for me to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can't do it and be like as </v>

1207
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:12.120
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled and happy as these people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Werner Herzog documentary.</v>

1208
00:57:12.121 --> 00:57:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

1209
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I know?</v>

1210
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 1>People are so different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They vary so much and I know people that</v>

1211
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 1>are fucking miserable when you take them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the woods,</v>

1212
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.083
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially people who don't exercise at </v>

1213
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.773
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him about a guy that </v>

1214
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exercise at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to make it up a big steep hill?</v>

1215
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1216
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feet started hurting.</v>

1217
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:36.754
<v Speaker 1>Her ankles pop like they're basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sticks around and buy bags of </v>

1218
00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:41.194
<v Speaker 1>Jello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really gets going and then they have </v>

1219
00:57:43.061 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 1>to move their body up a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1220
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.813
<v Speaker 1>We had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live on a hill and they were paving </v>

1221
00:57:47.951 --> 00:57:50.830
<v Speaker 1>it the other day and my office looks out</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

1222
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.980
<v Speaker 1>over the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1223
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 1>and I watched people walk their dogs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>

1224
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 1>that's why I texted you about hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can talk about later.</v>

1225
00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1226
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:00.933
<v Speaker 1>so they're paving the streets so </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone had to park down at the bottom </v>

1227
00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 1>of the street so everyone had to walk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cars and I never saw these people.</v>

1228
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.133
<v Speaker 1>They were coming out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like stick people walking and </v>

1229
00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 1>then having to go back up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miserable.</v>

1230
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:15.603
<v Speaker 1>They don't walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never walk in and they're like </v>

1231
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 1>trying to like get up a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1232
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.280
<v Speaker 1>like a broken down robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:23.114
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people were injured for </v>

1234
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:25.504
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people they just stopped using </v>

1235
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:29.190
<v Speaker 1>it and it started deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1236
00:58:29.191 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you tribute that to getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely a factor,</v>

1237
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's more of a factor when you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

1238
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like some Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>infomercial.</v>

1239
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I know I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1240
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm being honest like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about do the shit that </v>

1241

<v Speaker 1>you know you do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>class who looks like a Greek statue.</v>

1243
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go completely nuts,</v>

1244
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but you got to move.</v>

1245
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.060

<v Speaker 1>Got To do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Walk up hills if you can.</v>

1247
00:58:56.591 --> 00:59:00.610

<v Speaker 1>it's fucking giant for you and don't for</v>

1248
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.503
<v Speaker 1>Chrysler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you're really running when </v>

1249
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you're running on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

1250
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I was running yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that because I just</v>

1251
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.800
<v Speaker 1>listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs Cleveland,</v>

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Told me the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went five miles.</v>

1262
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:38.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I go five miles isn't even a </v>

1263
00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:40.814
<v Speaker 1>method of transportation if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I got off this thing walking around </v>

1264
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when you're on a treadmill,</v>

1265
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you're mimicking running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:51.794
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of running the with the </v>

1267
00:59:53.421 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>thing you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like 60 percent,</v>

1268
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent running.</v>

1269
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running is.</v>

1270
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It's better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elliptical is what is that?</v>

1271
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pulling.</v>

1272
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling out my going miles by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling.</v>

1273
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when you texted me that you do the</v>

1274
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 1>hills for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean though?</v>

1275
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean an hour and that's how long the </v>
<v Speaker 1>run takes.</v>

1276
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Takes it outside for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you go,</v>

1277
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>what time I start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my.</v>

1278
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.373
<v Speaker 1>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone further and shorter and I'll </v>

1279
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>still go shorter if I'm short on time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the end part of my run that I've</v>

1280
01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:26.804
<v Speaker 1>been doing pretty regularly is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is a mile and seven tenths of that </v>

1281
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>is straight up and it's fucking rough.</v>

1282
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

1283
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>If I could get up it away with a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>

1284
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:42.224
<v Speaker 1>steady pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm way to meet head for that so I </v>

1285
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>do mad sprints until I can't do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1286
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And then I paused and I try to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pause down to a minute,</v>

1287
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>pause down to a minute where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat gets to below 1:40</v>

1288
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:55.424
<v Speaker 1>beats a second and then I charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have spots where I know that I can </v>

1289
01:00:58.671 --> 01:00:59.504
<v Speaker 1>reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I try to go to 20 yards past that </v>

1290
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:02.984
<v Speaker 1>spot to go 20 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ultimate goal is I'll never </v>

1291
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:07.574
<v Speaker 1>really make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate goal is to be able to </v>

1292
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>sprint all the way up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

1293
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>To sprint all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this killer hill,</v>

1294
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>not the one I was just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>going up the other way.</v>

1295
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a killer hill paved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's killer and uh,</v>

1296
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking I should do because I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go run three miles,</v>

1297
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1298
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.663
<v Speaker 1>it's a little hilly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1299
01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking like if I were to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just spend the workout going up and down</v>

1300
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>that hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing,</v>

1301
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would be,</v>

1302
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:35.923
<v Speaker 1>what would constitute too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable or more than the three miles </v>

1303
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that I'm running.</v>

1304
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>It'll be way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be harder,</v>

1305
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:43.574
<v Speaker 1>but would do it three times or I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say do it once and see how you feel and </v>

1306
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe don't even do it that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1307
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:51.344
<v Speaker 1>that I've heard that advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking terrible listener to my </v>

1308
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:55.694
<v Speaker 1>own advice because I always do too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then get real sore and then I </v>

1309
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.791
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1310
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I got to back this off and build up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1311
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>That that was a big thing with me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the running.</v>

1312
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:04.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to go way hard on it real quick </v>

1313
01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and also tried to go way hard on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those five finger shoes.</v>

1314
01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be super careful with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1315
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's great benefit in those things,</v>

1316
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but you think they lost the class action</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit,</v>

1317
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and I should clear this up for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have been texting</v>

1318
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.023
<v Speaker 3>me about this or I'm messaging me or </v>
<v Speaker 3>commenting on my instagram posts about </v>

1319
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 3>those things I learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1320
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paid by these people.</v>

1321
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't support me in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>

1322
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 3>They never spent a dime on advertising </v>
<v Speaker 3>or penny advertising this podcast.</v>

1323
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 3>This is vibram vibram five fivefingers </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes.</v>

1324
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I learned about them from and I learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about them before monkey.</v>

1325
01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>But mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1326
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.190
<v Speaker 3>those five finger toasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Mark Sisson,</v>

1327
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 3>who is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very well respected,</v>

1328
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance athlete.</v>

1329
01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.100
<v Speaker 3>He was coach and now he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1330
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:52.423
<v Speaker 3>he brought this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the primal blueprint about like healthy </v>

1331
01:02:55.621 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 3>diets and he goes back and forth from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Quito or to like a real,</v>

1332
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.520
<v Speaker 3>real low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low carb,</v>

1333
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.730
<v Speaker 3>very fat adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really very smart and very,</v>

1334
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 3>very well educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name again?</v>

1335
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Mark Sisson says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about these things,</v>

1336
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:11.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's the only things you.</v>

1337
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Whereas most times he's barefoot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's essentially.</v>

1338
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's essentially saying that your feet </v>

1339
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:17.203
<v Speaker 3>are in shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your feet being in a cast and </v>

1340
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:20.034
<v Speaker 3>all those muscles in your feet sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrophy and then when you put on those </v>

1341
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 3>five finger shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those muscles have to work in a way that</v>

1342
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>really don't have to work when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a shoe.</v>

1343
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:28.913
<v Speaker 3>It's much harder for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the same exercise that you would do </v>

1344
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:36.420
<v Speaker 3>the same run is way harder because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet are getting away.</v>

1345
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:37.254
<v Speaker 3>Harder workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be careful because if </v>

1346
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:42.400
<v Speaker 3>you go too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people get plantar fasciitis,</v>

1347
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.363
<v Speaker 3>which is a really bad like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pain in the bottom of their foot with </v>

1348
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:50.903
<v Speaker 3>the Fascia is all fucked up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tearing and the bottom of your foot is </v>

1349
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:57.700
<v Speaker 3>in severe agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know several people that have got it,</v>

1350
01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.003
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

1351
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 3>From wearing those five finger or toe </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes on a treadmill,</v>

1352
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 3>kneel daily and he's light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even pushing mass.</v>

1353
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.070
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neil is a bit of an obsessive person</v>

1354
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.313
<v Speaker 3>like in a good way and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he got obsessed with running and </v>

1355
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.050
<v Speaker 3>maybe ran a little too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoes.</v>

1356
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be super careful though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was milled up slow,</v>

1357
01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:17.963
<v Speaker 3>but once you do build up you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could run in those things and like </v>

1358
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 3>my feet feel so different than they felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>like five months ago.</v>

1359
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.441
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1360
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:27.360
<v Speaker 3>they're way different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way stronger.</v>

1361
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Way Stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you need strong feet?</v>

1362
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where it's good.</v>

1363
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 3>When are you doing with these feet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just walking around.</v>

1364
01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 3>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.433
<v Speaker 3>My ankles are stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My feet because I'm running all this </v>

1366
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:39.834
<v Speaker 3>weird fucked up terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Libyans when you get up at night to go </v>

1367
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:44.760
<v Speaker 3>to the bathroom where you wake up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

1368
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get up and my ankles are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>waking up kind of a thing.</v>

1369
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you still have that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1370
01:04:50.421 --> 01:04:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any of that?</v>

1371
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Did you before you ran in these shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1372
01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:55.530
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really had much ankle pain.</v>

1373
01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:58.620
<v Speaker 3>If a temporary just like creaky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1374
01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Like beer cans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ankle now for whatever reason,</v>

1375
01:05:00.871 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did so much of my youth kicking.</v>

1376
01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Things like my ankles are pretty strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1377
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.493
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're throwing kicks like </v>

1378
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you think about especially like a side </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick or a front kick,</v>

1379
01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 3>there is so much pressure on the ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

1380
01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using them not so much with round</v>

1381
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:19.750
<v Speaker 3>kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>round kicks.</v>

1382
01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Kind of pull it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit with the Shin,</v>

1383
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 3>but when you're hitting with the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot itself,</v>

1384
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.293
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of stress on the ankle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my ankles develop really strong </v>

1385
01:05:28.301 --> 01:05:29.134
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

1386
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.063
<v Speaker 3>So when I run I feel a big difference in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the workout when I run up a straight </v>

1387
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:39.481
<v Speaker 3>hill versus a run up like a trail with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks and shit where I have to jump from</v>

1388
01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 3>one step stone to another and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigating your way with me.</v>

1389
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come do it with me one time.</v>

1390
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.391
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1391
01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:47.224
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it with the five finger shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing regular shoes and I still </v>

1392
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 3>alternate when I need a really hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>

1393
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I alternate like and then I put these on</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this is what I like the best.</v>

1394
01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He's Solomon trail shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1395
01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

1396
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Because this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tread here is the shit shreds slide</v>

1397
01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:03.550
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1398
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.630
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1399
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.740
<v Speaker 3>like a dirt bike tire or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just grips in the dirt.</v>

1400
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like the best traction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far?</v>

1401
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.430
<v Speaker 3>How far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>

1402
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 3>like a flat run.</v>

1403
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever flat rate.</v>

1404
01:06:16.171 --> 01:06:17.004
<v Speaker 3>Don't ever fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and I run are always going up in </v>

1405
01:06:18.031 --> 01:06:19.470
<v Speaker 3>these trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These little.</v>

1406
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's exciting.</v>

1407
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.090
<v Speaker 3>It's so much more fun when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trail post to go back to nature.</v>

1408
01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:25.924
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get excited when you're out </v>

1409
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.133
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a person occasionally walking </v>

1410
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 3>their dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out,</v>

1411
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 3>walking the trails and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's great,</v>

1412
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:33.394
<v Speaker 3>but it's mostly just me running these </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard ass hills is nothing more fun when </v>

1413
01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:37.744
<v Speaker 3>you're sprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that was a kid we walked to school </v>

1414
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 3>through the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1415
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.710
<v Speaker 3>It was just when you would take off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're jumping from rock to rock,</v>

1416
01:06:44.711 --> 01:06:45.544
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you know the trail and </v>

1417
01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:48.840
<v Speaker 3>you know where are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to jump in slide.</v>

1418
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're playing.</v>

1419
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly it.</v>

1420
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 3>You're planning now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I run to it,</v>

1421
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to do that.</v>

1422
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:58.050
<v Speaker 3>When I ran for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when first you can have a four year run,</v>

1423
01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.143
<v Speaker 3>that's then I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'd start thinking I'm having a </v>

1424
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 3>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A heart attack.</v>

1425
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Your heart is working hard to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1426
01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.341
<v Speaker 3>Go for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1427
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1428
01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.560
<v Speaker 3>there's been proof that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance athletes find great benefit in</v>

1429
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1430
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Even smoking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vaping.</v>

1431
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:18.820
<v Speaker 3>It in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them edibles.</v>

1432
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like it dilates your lungs.</v>

1433
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Make sure lungs take in more oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rear.</v>

1434
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 3>It also makes you more in tune with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1435
01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:28.210
<v Speaker 3>A lot of weight lifter smoke weed before</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lift weights.</v>

1436
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Really lot of weightlifters more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more now than ever before.</v>

1437
01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I get messages from people all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that say,</v>

1438
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:34.200
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1439
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a loser.</v>

1440
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.334
<v Speaker 3>Like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a loser for smoking pot before I </v>

1441
01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 3>worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at some of my best workouts ever,</v>

1442
01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about gets so blitzed </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you like,</v>

1443
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you look at the curl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1444
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 3>how do I know how to move my arm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1445
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get just a little high.</v>

1446
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:48.873
<v Speaker 3>We just a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your muscles like yoga to like Terence </v>

1447
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna actually believed that yoga was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a guide to how to use Hash.</v>

1448
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 3>He felt like has sheesh and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and marijuana,</v>

1449
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.190
<v Speaker 3>you know how she says made from </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana?</v>

1450
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1451
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashish is awesome.</v>

1452
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.433
<v Speaker 3>And people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your sash sounds like you're doing </v>

1453
01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to dine,</v>

1454
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>educated uninitiated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just super strong</v>

1455
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.813
<v Speaker 6>DHC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1456
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

1457
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1458
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:23.390
<v Speaker 6>the feeling that they would get from it </v>
<v Speaker 6>is from Yoga,</v>

1459
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 6>doing it that way is what inspired those</v>
<v Speaker 6>moves.</v>

1460
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 6>And he believes that yoga started with </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that were smoking hash.</v>

1461
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 6>He believes that that's where it </v>
<v Speaker 6>originated from.</v>

1462
01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 6>Like when you're high and you start </v>
<v Speaker 6>stretching,</v>

1463
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.203
<v Speaker 6>it feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these people are known torris users </v>

1464
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:41.220
<v Speaker 6>of cannabis and how she and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoke,</v>

1465
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.160
<v Speaker 6>like he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dirty secret amongst dues.</v>

1466
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.223
<v Speaker 6>Is that really what they're concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 6>on is how many chillums can you smoke </v>

1467
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.860
<v Speaker 6>and still be there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they,</v>

1468
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 6>they'll like take pride in chillum is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a head of Hash.</v>

1469
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:54.781
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a call.</v>

1470
01:08:54.781 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 6>The chillum yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the exact definition of Chelan?</v>

1471
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.820
<v Speaker 6>Because the only people I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 6>is hash people talk about it and I don't</v>

1472
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 6>see him chill them find that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>not A.</v>

1473
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.110
<v Speaker 6>I've only smoked hash couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not like a prolific hash user,</v>

1474
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:13.620
<v Speaker 6>but in other countries there's serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>ha.</v>

1475
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.653
<v Speaker 6>It's weird because like people get </v>
<v Speaker 6>busted and they get treated when they </v>

1476
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:17.234
<v Speaker 6>get busted with Hash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they're smuggling meth or </v>

1477
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1478
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 6>it sounds more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like a different thing.</v>

1479
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.080
<v Speaker 6>It's not a dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the point.</v>

1480
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.040
<v Speaker 6>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1481
01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:27.243
<v Speaker 6>but it gets classified in those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like people think of Hash as like </v>

1482
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.733
<v Speaker 6>something from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't that what they got arrested for </v>

1483
01:09:32.511 --> 01:09:33.780
<v Speaker 6>in the midnight express?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

1484
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.693
<v Speaker 6>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1485
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.613
<v Speaker 6>We'd,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1486
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:36.530
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1487

<v Speaker 6>These guys are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're painting themselves up like </v>

1492
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:50.580
<v Speaker 6>superheroes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's all dreadlocked.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's his face.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Looks like a ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So these are sod dudes that are smoking </v>

1495
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Speaker 6>chillums.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy beard.</v>

1496
01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:59.881
<v Speaker 6>Do you see the Hash there in his pipe?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Saad dues just get barbecued barbecue</v>

1497
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.040
<v Speaker 6>high and they do yoga and I noticed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What it is.</v>

1498
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:08.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

1499
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.533
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was before I was like doing yoga </v>

1500
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:11.294
<v Speaker 6>regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I had to do this show and I was </v>

1501
01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:13.964
<v Speaker 6>particularly nervous because someone I </v>
<v Speaker 6>really didn't like was in the audience </v>

1502
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 6>and really did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like Yay.</v>

1503
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.543
<v Speaker 6>I really didn't like was in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 6>and some people that were there to see </v>

1504
01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 6>me with were in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it was your night?</v>

1505
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:26.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was weird.</v>

1506
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.093
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what I did was I smoked weed and I </v>

1507
01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.653
<v Speaker 6>got really stretchy and I started </v>
<v Speaker 6>stretching out and in my stretching in </v>

1508
01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:40.280
<v Speaker 6>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like severe stretching is going to sound</v>

1509
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.260
<v Speaker 6>super fucking Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

1510
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.303
<v Speaker 6>I felt a severe sense of forgiveness for</v>
<v Speaker 6>this person that I don't like and I </v>

1511
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:50.340
<v Speaker 6>still don't like him to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.550
<v Speaker 6>I do avoid him at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a,</v>

1513
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:57.780
<v Speaker 6>it's not a healthy human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I felt a severe sense of forgiveness</v>

1514
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 6>and acceptance and almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like pity.</v>

1515
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:05.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1516
01:11:05.701 --> 01:11:06.770
<v Speaker 6>that's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's real.</v>

1517
01:11:06.771 --> 01:11:09.410
<v Speaker 6>That's not a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Love to have this weird love thing.</v>

1518
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.850
<v Speaker 6>I feel bad for the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm almost like I don't want him in</v>

1519
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.170
<v Speaker 6>my life because I don't want to manage </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1520
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.153
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1521
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.800
<v Speaker 5>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's yoga does.</v>

1522
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:17.663
<v Speaker 5>When you go into Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can be stressed and balled up and </v>

1523
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>you can have like a work thing rattling </v>
<v Speaker 5>in your head that's just.</v>

1524
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 5>And you could be pissed at somebody when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you come out,</v>

1525
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.583
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And is the thing that seems </v>

1526
01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 5>counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why would stretching make your mind</v>

1527
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 5>feel better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is going on?</v>

1528
01:11:35.581 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 5>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's all this rationalization,</v>

1529
01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:38.490
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>

1530
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>endorphins that are being released?</v>

1531
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:41.993
<v Speaker 5>Is it the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it just the fact that your body </v>

1532
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:46.170
<v Speaker 5>needed to exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

1533
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.820
<v Speaker 5>that's this sort of weird sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1534
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 5>need to dissect things and figure out </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one cause yeah,</v>

1535
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:55.794
<v Speaker 5>the one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a minimalist approach or minimalizing </v>

1536
01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:59.283
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to,</v>

1537
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 5>you want to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to get your head around it.</v>

1538
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 5>It's all those things.</v>

1539
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 5>It's the physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably the endorphins.</v>

1540
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.610
<v Speaker 5>It's the physical release of the muscles</v>
<v Speaker 5>which relaxes your body,</v>

1541
01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:10.880
<v Speaker 5>which relaxes your mind because </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's connected.</v>

1542
01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.913
<v Speaker 5>And it's also the act of stretching this</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense act of stretching and holding </v>

1543
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:16.824
<v Speaker 5>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does something for the overall way </v>

1544
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:22.380
<v Speaker 5>that your mind interacts with your body </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>

1545
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.333
<v Speaker 5>The time body affects the way your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where time becomes different in a class </v>

1546
01:12:26.461 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes by super quick and slow.</v>

1547
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 5>My 90 minute class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my yoga teacher said,</v>

1548
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:32.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she said,</v>

1549
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:34.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of class she said,</v>

1550
01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:39.951
<v Speaker 5>it's yoga is like aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You may not exactly know why it works,</v>

1551
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.710
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it works and it's the yoga.</v>

1552
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what exactly just </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened during this hour,</v>

1553
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 5>but I feel much more at peace when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk out of there.</v>

1554
01:12:50.641 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Then I did coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1555
01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:53.170
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hundred percent.</v>

1556
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to look at it.</v>

1557
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just works.</v>

1558
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.710
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1559
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 5>they talk crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't yoga though?</v>

1560
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is massaging your descending colon.</v>

1561
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.733
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1562
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 5>You can only use 70 percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>

1563
01:13:06.721 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not true.</v>

1564
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 5>That's been disproven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1566
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:12.174
<v Speaker 5>it took me a long time to find a yoga </v>
<v Speaker 5>teacher that wasn't taking me down the </v>

1567
01:13:15.281 --> 01:13:16.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1568
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 5>in the weird spots and talking all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1569
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 5>She's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's just do this.</v>

1570
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.120
<v Speaker 5>Here's the Po's correct your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

1571
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:27.360
<v Speaker 5>That she doesn't get hippy dippy one ohm</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're in.</v>

1572
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 5>It's just awesome enough as it is and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's on all of them that do this.</v>

1573
01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:31.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the place I go to,</v>

1574
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.570
<v Speaker 5>the trigger runs it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She never does it.</v>

1575
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.573
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't say crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's inspirational and there's a </v>

1576
01:13:36.631 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 5>lot of people in there that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>inspirational and all,</v>

1577
01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:40.320
<v Speaker 5>all their weird styles.</v>

1578
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:41.363
<v Speaker 5>Like this one dude that teaches my class</v>
<v Speaker 5>college freaky tattoos get this weird </v>

1579
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.180
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1580
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.083
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this other guy is like a boxing fan and </v>

1581
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 5>teaches a killer yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1582
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:52.110
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1583
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.880
<v Speaker 5>There's mutations of it and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1584
01:13:53.881 --> 01:13:56.390
<v Speaker 5>people start to make it into the sport </v>
<v Speaker 5>and do all this stuff.</v>

1585
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 5>People get a little fired up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1586
01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.510
<v Speaker 5>Not really into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1587
01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:00.880
<v Speaker 5>what I don't like is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1588
01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:04.440
<v Speaker 5>the dude that takes the shirt off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big sweaty older dude that takes his</v>

1589
01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:05.810
<v Speaker 5>shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1590
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 5>it's 90 percent women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like sit in the back,</v>

1591
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:10.223
<v Speaker 5>calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't make a scene just as a dude do </v>

1592
01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 5>your thing and get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

1593
01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:15.913
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a great gross ponytail and he </v>

1594
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 5>takes his shirt off and take their shirt</v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

1595
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep their shirt on in your place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep my shirt on.</v>

1596
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.600
<v Speaker 5>C,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one in my place.</v>

1597
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 5>Keeps her shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No guys,</v>

1598
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 5>maybe like one out of 10 I'm sweating so</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sweating like an animal.</v>

1600
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.490
<v Speaker 5>One hundred and five degrees in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree.</v>

1601

<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grind the grass up and then pushed it </v>

1703
01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and be like a fireplace and you can put </v>
<v Speaker 1>a neck hole.</v>

1704
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You get the butter out the other end so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look so nice.</v>

01:19:50.471 --> 01:19:51.304
<v Speaker 1>It's like a pot pie crust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meat which is the crust of the pot </v>

1717
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:58.360
<v Speaker 1>pie and then the inside is all tit </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No guilt milk out of that fucker all day</v>

1719
01:20:02.151 --> 01:20:02.984
<v Speaker 1>long and it's phenomenal and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just exists on a substrate of ground </v>

1720
01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>up grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you</v>

<v Speaker 6>pie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know you have that aluminum foil </v>

<v Speaker 6>around the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.533

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1762
01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 5>There is a funny know when you need a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tourniquet.</v>

1763
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:53.500
<v Speaker 5>It was a little pocket square and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Madonna came in to do the show and uh,</v>

1764
01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.373
<v Speaker 5>the whole building was like electric.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like Madonna is coming and it </v>

1765
01:21:57.661 --> 01:21:58.494
<v Speaker 5>really was like energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could feel energy in the </v>

1766
01:22:00.811 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 5>building because Madonna was walking in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you call her Madonna?</v>

1767
01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.140
<v Speaker 5>So I came in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:22:04.141 --> 01:22:04.974
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to go meet her before the show or </v>

1769
01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:06.684
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be too freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just walked into the dressing room </v>

1770
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hi Madonna.</v>

1771
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm Tom.</v>

<v Speaker 5>this has got to go</v>

1774
01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.520
<v Speaker 7>with the pocket square out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And like I said,</v>

1775
01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.350
<v Speaker 7>I'm not wearing it.</v>

1776
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:24.183
<v Speaker 6>Guy Ritchie,</v>

1778
01:22:30.161 --> 01:22:33.160
<v Speaker 6>the importance of the suit and having a </v>
<v Speaker 6>square.</v>

1779
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:37.370
<v Speaker 5>Hilarious because she immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just met her two seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A good move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was talking about ties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1831
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:44.370
<v Speaker 1>that's all anybody would go for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1832
01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Of course everybody had to wear a tie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of wearing a belt,</v>

1833
01:24:49.351 --> 01:24:50.184
<v Speaker 1>everybody has to wear a tie or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the belt and wrap it around the </v>

1834
01:24:51.601 --> 01:24:52.580
<v Speaker 1>dude's neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save.</v>

1835
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:55.230
<v Speaker 1>You started with the black belt tied </v>
<v Speaker 1>around your neck,</v>

1836
01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.033
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would go for anything other than </v>

1837
01:24:58.501 --> 01:25:01.800
<v Speaker 1>the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a hand under that belt,</v>

1838
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.030
<v Speaker 1>grab it and twist and you're out cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do a secure,</v>

1839
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.170
<v Speaker 1>secure some part of your body weight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep you from moving in.</v>

1840
01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.053
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like a side mount or a crucifix </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where I have trapping arm </v>

1841
01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.990
<v Speaker 1>trapped the other arm with my neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to choke the shit out of you.</v>

1842
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:21.540
<v Speaker 1>This isn't happening at your daughter's </v>
<v Speaker 1>school function,</v>

1843
01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grab someone's belt and knock him if.</v>

1844
01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:28.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1845
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.240
<v Speaker 1>If someone had a belt around her neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>like around the neck,</v>

1846
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you guys Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys were rolling around.</v>

1847
01:25:33.481 --> 01:25:35.730
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate goal would be to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt around the guy's neck,</v>

1848
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:37.243
<v Speaker 1>like if you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the number one thing to </v>

1849
01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:40.920
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you already had it,</v>

1850
01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>like nodded around your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was how you started,</v>

1851
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.210
<v Speaker 1>were you not around your waist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1852
01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Keep people would kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>

1853
01:25:48.751 --> 01:25:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Grabbed that rope around your neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1854
01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:53.190
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the ultimate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget foot locks.</v>

1855
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your foot lock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've done all the work for me.</v>

1856
01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:57.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to grab that rope around your </v>

1857
01:25:57.871 --> 01:25:58.704
<v Speaker 1>neck and put you to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy because all you'd have to </v>

1858
01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:02.160
<v Speaker 1>do is twist it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell.</v>

1859
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I like I had a choke</v>

1860
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.450
<v Speaker 6>my dog out once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That way.</v>

1861
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:06.703
<v Speaker 6>Dog was attacking a cat and I got my </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand inside his collar and I put them </v>

1862
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 6>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1863
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just grabbed.</v>

1864
01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 6>I grabbed his collar and I twisted it </v>
<v Speaker 6>down and cranked it.</v>

1865
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.190
<v Speaker 6>I did you Jitsu on my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put them right here.</v>

1866
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 6>Knocked them out instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instantly.</v>

1867
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like it does a person resisting.</v>

1868
01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:26.080
<v Speaker 6>He didn't know what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I got it in there,</v>

1869
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:26.953
<v Speaker 6>grabbed a of where the buckle is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think I stepped over him and </v>

1870
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:34.160
<v Speaker 6>cranked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just went limp when cat took off.</v>

1871
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:35.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to try that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It works.</v>

1872
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.870
<v Speaker 6>That shouldn't do it to dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

1873
01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:39.704
<v Speaker 6>but that's a person too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the idea is the arteries around </v>

1874
01:26:42.021 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 6>your neck that feed your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You shut those off like a garden hose.</v>

1875
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Think like you.</v>

1876
01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.500
<v Speaker 6>You fold the garden hose and then the </v>
<v Speaker 6>water stops falling.</v>

1877
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens to your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you go out.</v>

1878
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:55.390
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's not nearly as dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 6>as a knockout people's.</v>

1879
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 6>It's just flow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People get confused about that.</v>

1880
01:26:57.771 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 6>Like they think that a concussion and </v>
<v Speaker 6>being choked out.</v>

1881
01:27:00.351 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still giving me your brain damage,</v>

1882
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:02.970
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not.</v>

1883
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.870
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to your brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It happens.</v>

1884
01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:06.340
<v Speaker 6>People in class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they go right back to rolling.</v>

1885
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:08.300
<v Speaker 6>They don't have no ill effects at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1886
01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just go to sleep back to it.</v>

1887
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 6>You wake up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>

1888
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't even realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what happened?</v>

1889
01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:14.181
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit.</v>

1890
01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:15.014
<v Speaker 6>That I get choked out and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>starts laughing because that happens in </v>

1891
01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.690
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu class people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as you're fine,</v>

1892
01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.570
<v Speaker 6>people will start laughing because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens to everybody.</v>

1893
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

1894
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:23.690
<v Speaker 6>If you don't tap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go to sleep.</v>

1895
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:26.900
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds fun.</v>

1896
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.490
<v Speaker 6>It is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>honestly.</v>

1897
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Till girl does it to super humiliating.</v>

1898
01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.280
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When's the last time you were choked out</v>

1899
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.710
<v Speaker 6>by a girl or a guy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anybody?</v>

1900
01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:37.873
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Jacques Machado tapped me like a </v>

1901
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:41.340
<v Speaker 6>few months back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1902
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 6>But he always Ken.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1903
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:43.783
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was an arm bar when you rolled with </v>

1904
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:47.090
<v Speaker 6>someone who's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get caught.</v>

1905
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:47.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just.</v>

1906
01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.950
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no way around it.</v>

1907
01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want a girl doesn't deal.</v>

1908
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 6>Duncan was taking some classes at CIC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kept choking him out.</v>

1909
01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.540
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to work on this.</v>

1910
01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.390
<v Speaker 6>Some people just don't get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1911
01:27:59.690 --> 01:28:02.000
<v Speaker 6>But for people who don't get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

1912
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:03.083
<v Speaker 6>Just get into something else that's hard</v>
<v Speaker 6>to just get into something that's hard </v>

1913
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 6>to do.</v>

1914
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 6>Would you get high into Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1915
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.710
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

1916
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:12.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super popular.</v>

1917
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.640
<v Speaker 6>Makes you better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

1918
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1919
01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.490
<v Speaker 6>I think you're more conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>More focused on what you're doing.</v>

1920
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:20.324
<v Speaker 6>It it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It provides a type of focus and you </v>

1921
01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.730
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't seem as here's the thing,</v>

1922
01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.770
<v Speaker 6>the type of consciousness that you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you are rolling with person,</v>

1923
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.633
<v Speaker 6>a person in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when someone's trying to get you and </v>

1924
01:28:32.721 --> 01:28:33.554
<v Speaker 6>you're trying to defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that type of feeling that you get is </v>

1925
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 6>very different than any feeling that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>get in most of life other than an actual</v>

1926
01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:43.340
<v Speaker 6>conflict with the person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is pretty rare.</v>

1927
01:28:43.341 --> 01:28:44.810
<v Speaker 6>Luckily we have a nice society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1928
01:28:44.811 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you live in a nice neighborhood,</v>

1929
01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:47.983
<v Speaker 6>but that feeling for whatever reason </v>
<v Speaker 6>lends itself very well to getting high </v>

1930
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:58.160
<v Speaker 6>because when you get high you get into </v>
<v Speaker 6>this sort of like not me state,</v>

1931
01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 6>like an ego dropped off state.</v>

1932
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:02.430
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the reasons why people get</v>
<v Speaker 6>so vulnerable.</v>

1933
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.740
<v Speaker 6>They feel vulnerable because they feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>like they don't.</v>

1934
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:07.880
<v Speaker 6>They don't have that ego anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very ego diminishing subs.</v>

1935
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 6>It's like a almost like a medicine for </v>
<v Speaker 6>diminishing the ego.</v>

1936
01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 6>Obviously the effects are different on </v>
<v Speaker 6>different people,</v>

1937
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.393
<v Speaker 6>but that on top of the focus aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes it really attractive to people </v>

1938
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 6>who do Jujitsu because you can let go of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bullshit.</v>

1939
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:25.254
<v Speaker 6>You not all tense and then you could </v>
<v Speaker 6>focus on what you're actually trying to </v>

1940
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 6>do and it doesn't get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see things better.</v>

1941
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.033
<v Speaker 6>He thinks you feel things better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're more cognizant of how your body </v>

1942
01:29:34.741 --> 01:29:35.574
<v Speaker 6>works and some people say that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>cop out and that really you should just </v>

1943
01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 6>get more comfortable with your body </v>
<v Speaker 6>period and they're probably right.</v>

1944
01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:42.973
<v Speaker 6>It's probably something to that too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but is there any elements like when you </v>

1945
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.370
<v Speaker 6>get high where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all cool.</v>

1946
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.233
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter because you need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need an edge to go fight fighting </v>

1947
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.070
<v Speaker 6>because you're not hitting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1948
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.333
<v Speaker 6>and I mean I think it's more of A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean a boxing match is obviously a </v>

1949
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:02.004
<v Speaker 6>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not in the new definition and </v>

1950
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:08.890
<v Speaker 6>the new definition it a fight is a mixed</v>
<v Speaker 6>martial arts fight where you're in.</v>

1951
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 6>Even then there's rules that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>applied,</v>

1952
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.761
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1953
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:14.400
<v Speaker 6>So like there's no eye gouging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no ball kicks,</v>

1954
01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:16.020
<v Speaker 6>there's no hitting to the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>head.</v>

1955
01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 6>You can't elbow some of the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>head,</v>

1956
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:23.361
<v Speaker 6>which is in a way healthier for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>athletes involved,</v>

1957
01:30:23.671 --> 01:30:28.671
<v Speaker 6>but in another way more delusional </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it removes a very dangerous at.</v>

1958
01:30:29.081 --> 01:30:30.700
<v Speaker 6>Like Eddie Bravo is always talking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1959
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:33.600
<v Speaker 6>that when guys used to take guys back in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the early days,</v>

1960
01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 6>what they would do instantly his elbow </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the back of the head,</v>

1961
01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:39.270
<v Speaker 6>like it didn't matter if you defend the </v>
<v Speaker 6>choke or not.</v>

1962
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:40.830
<v Speaker 6>If someone starts smashing the back of </v>
<v Speaker 6>your head,</v>

1963
01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:43.670
<v Speaker 6>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a terrible position to be in that.</v>

1964
01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:47.670
<v Speaker 6>That is removed from mma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So because that's removed from mma,</v>

1965
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:49.703
<v Speaker 6>you almost have to look at an mma fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is absolutely a fight as in a way </v>

1966
01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:53.603
<v Speaker 6>kind of a match.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A mixed martial arts math because the </v>

1967
01:30:55.771 --> 01:30:56.604
<v Speaker 6>rules are so rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where much more loose than boxing but </v>

1968
01:30:59.491 --> 01:31:02.940
<v Speaker 6>still rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you've got a Jujitsu match for sure.</v>

1969
01:31:02.941 --> 01:31:05.470
<v Speaker 6>Not really a fight because you get leg </v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked,</v>

1970
01:31:05.471 --> 01:31:06.304
<v Speaker 6>you can't get elbowed in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to get need into a </v>

1971
01:31:07.981 --> 01:31:10.020
<v Speaker 6>coma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a totally different experience than</v>

1972
01:31:10.021 --> 01:31:14.430
<v Speaker 6>a fight and it's almost disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some ways to call a Jujitsu match,</v>

1973
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.410
<v Speaker 6>a fight rather,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would like to refer to it as fight,</v>

1974
01:31:17.411 --> 01:31:18.850
<v Speaker 6>so nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1975
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:21.000
<v Speaker 6>If you don't know and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at it from the outside,</v>

1976
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.680
<v Speaker 6>boxing matches more like a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1977
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.680
<v Speaker 6>Because you're hitting each other in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this grave danger.</v>

1978
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:27.260
<v Speaker 6>You're really trying to kill each other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1979
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're smashing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1980
01:31:28.561 --> 01:31:31.640
<v Speaker 6>Not trying to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you are using your,</v>

1981
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.533
<v Speaker 6>your explosive force on a person trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to take them out and it's a very </v>

1982
01:31:36.601 --> 01:31:39.900
<v Speaker 6>dangerous encounter with severe </v>
<v Speaker 6>consequences for your brain.</v>

1983
01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a fight a lot,</v>

1984
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.500
<v Speaker 6>but it's a fight with very limited </v>
<v Speaker 6>rules.</v>

1985
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because like a Meu Thai fighter,</v>

1986
01:31:45.661 --> 01:31:46.494
<v Speaker 6>a really good more Thai fighter would </v>
<v Speaker 6>kill most really good boxers if the </v>

1987
01:31:51.061 --> 01:31:51.894
<v Speaker 6>boxer didn't know what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're really good Thai </v>

1988
01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:54.983
<v Speaker 6>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gonna be very hard to hit them to </v>

1989
01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 6>get that close to him and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>start kicking your legs immediately.</v>

1990
01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:58.973
<v Speaker 6>What's more time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's Thai boxing because they have more </v>

1991
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:02.640
<v Speaker 6>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1992
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 6>Legs to kick the legs a lot and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 6>push you away with their front kick.</v>

1993
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 6>There's so much stuff that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna be able to do.</v>

1994
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.823
<v Speaker 6>Box will be way better with his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but more Thai fighter is usually pretty </v>

1995
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:13.234
<v Speaker 6>good with their hands already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially good enough to land a </v>

1996
01:32:15.371 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 6>shitload of kicks on you and keep you </v>
<v Speaker 6>from getting in range and if you did get</v>

1997
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:19.890
<v Speaker 6>arranged,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they clench you in.</v>

1998
01:32:19.891 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 6>They need in the body and the elbow you </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the head.</v>

1999
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:25.090
<v Speaker 6>It's a way more complete striking system</v>
<v Speaker 6>than regular box.</v>

2000
01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.793
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel like there's too many rules?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like do you feel like it should be just </v>

2001
01:32:28.871 --> 01:32:32.140
<v Speaker 6>opened up in mma?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like make it real?</v>

2002
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:33.063
<v Speaker 6>Yes and no because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like specialists like I love that </v>

2003
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:36.424
<v Speaker 6>conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>floyd mayweather fight because it was a </v>

2004
01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:38.584
<v Speaker 6>real specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to see like a really elite high </v>

2005
01:32:41.651 --> 01:32:46.651
<v Speaker 6>level striker from MMA become almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>helpless against a world champion.</v>

2006
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.753
<v Speaker 6>Probably the best advert box you get to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see this is what happens when a </v>

2007
01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:52.774
<v Speaker 6>specialist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone who's really good at something </v>

2008
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:59.280
<v Speaker 6>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I wanted to uh,</v>

2009
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:02.710
<v Speaker 6>roll against someone who's like a real </v>
<v Speaker 6>high level Jujitsu black belt,</v>

2010
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 6>I would get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would get killed,</v>

2011
01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.193
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you've got a really good jujitsu </v>

2012
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 6>black belt from the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would kill me.</v>

2013
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.940
<v Speaker 6>But a really good jujitsu black fruit </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the UFC.</v>

2014
01:33:12.941 --> 01:33:15.580
<v Speaker 6>Mike get killed by a really good Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 6>world champion.</v>

2015
01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:17.173
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's all these levels and </v>
<v Speaker 6>levels and the only way you achieve </v>

2016
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 6>those levels as true specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a true specialist,</v>

2017
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:27.520
<v Speaker 6>is it such a different level?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you watch,</v>

2018
01:33:28.210 --> 01:33:29.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sanchez,</v>

2019
01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.940
<v Speaker 6>you ever heard of Sam Chai?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thailand.</v>

2020
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.380
<v Speaker 6>He's probably one of the greatest ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>combat sports athletes ever.</v>

2021
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:39.040
<v Speaker 6>And he's fights every couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I followed him on instagram.</v>

2022
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 6>He's 36 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's.</v>

2023
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:41.973
<v Speaker 6>He fights people way smaller than him </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the time and although he knocks a </v>

2024
01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:46.354
<v Speaker 6>lot of people out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of his fights are won by him just </v>

2025
01:33:49.751 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 6>doing shit to the opponent that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>just can't deal with.</v>

2026
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 6>He just kicks the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He hits them when they're not looking.</v>

2027
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 6>They don't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's so clever and fast or anything.</v>

2028
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:59.683
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's just a wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a technical wizard inside the ring and </v>

2029
01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.053
<v Speaker 6>when you watch him you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh well there's levels even to this </v>

2030
01:34:07.091 --> 01:34:10.840
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy is such a specialist at anybody</v>

2031
01:34:10.841 --> 01:34:11.674
<v Speaker 6>outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like floyd mayweather wanted to fight </v>

2032
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 6>sand Chai lattes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anti kick him.</v>

2033
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:19.060
<v Speaker 6>It would be one of the most lopsided </v>
<v Speaker 6>fights you've ever seen.</v>

2034
01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:19.923
<v Speaker 6>It would be horrific to watch watching a</v>
<v Speaker 6>world class boxer just getting exposed </v>

2035
01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:25.870
<v Speaker 6>to legs kicked out from under him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked in the face,</v>

2036
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:27.310
<v Speaker 6>legs kicked out from under him.</v>

2037
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:29.530
<v Speaker 6>No interface elbowed in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2038
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:32.650
<v Speaker 6>don't you think mcgregor?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he was allowed to do his thing?</v>

2039
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2040
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.360
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>

2041
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 6>Sanchez Chai could probably do that to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Mcgregor,</v>

2042
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's levels and levels.</v>

2043
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:41.920
<v Speaker 6>What Mcgregor and encountered with Floyd</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mayweather,</v>

2044
01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.850
<v Speaker 6>he would encounter in Thai boxing with </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

2045
01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:47.980
<v Speaker 6>a fantastic one of the greatest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the guy like San shy.</v>

2046
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.100
<v Speaker 6>So it sounds like the rules actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>make it more interesting.</v>

2047
01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 6>They do have to become.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2048
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:55.600
<v Speaker 6>So the only way you find out who the </v>
<v Speaker 6>really best Jujitsu guys is,</v>

2049
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:57.570
<v Speaker 6>you have to have them only compete in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>

2050
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:59.590
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because with strikings,</v>

2051
01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.900
<v Speaker 6>all this other stuff involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You hurt people with punches and knees,</v>

2052
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.510
<v Speaker 6>but when you want to look at a complete </v>
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>

2053
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:06.703
<v Speaker 6>complete system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mixed martial arts is as close as it </v>

2054
01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:08.864
<v Speaker 6>comes without the elbows to the head </v>
<v Speaker 6>kicks when the down to the head on down </v>

2055
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:15.140
<v Speaker 6>fighter and the stomps and the knees to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the head on a down fighter.</v>

2056
01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:15.993
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the really dirty shit like </v>

2057
01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 6>eyeball pokes and the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's always going to be a match.</v>

2058
01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 6>You can't bite someone's nose off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always going to be a match.</v>

2059
01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.493
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2060
01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.720
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be some limit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:35:28.170 --> 01:35:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you still call it a fight,</v>

2062
01:35:30.090 --> 01:35:32.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how,</v>

2063
01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:36.750
<v Speaker 4>how many hills to I have to run to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>back into my old shape?</v>

2064
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:40.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's this whole fucking God damn</v>

2065
01:35:40.061 --> 01:35:41.830
<v Speaker 6>delicious bread you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's an issue.</v>

2066
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened?</v>

2067
01:35:46.351 --> 01:35:47.184
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I visited this a woman in Ohio who's </v>

2068
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.400
<v Speaker 4>really good bakers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kate spreads anchors.</v>

2069
01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's amazing.</v>

2070
01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:59.040
<v Speaker 4>And I saw it flower she had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2071
01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:00.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get that flower.</v>

2072
01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what I got to get this one out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I looked up online where she gets the</v>

2073
01:36:04.381 --> 01:36:06.510
<v Speaker 4>flower comes from Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2074
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:09.480
<v Speaker 4>And the smallest you can get as a 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pound bag.</v>

2075
01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:10.973
<v Speaker 4>So I have 2:50</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound bags of wheat and artists and all </v>

2076
01:36:14.521 --> 01:36:17.550
<v Speaker 4>purpose flour in my kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2077
01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking like if you were to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>50 pounds of flour,</v>

2078
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.380
<v Speaker 4>you would be a big fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So dude.</v>

2079
01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.560
<v Speaker 4>But the flower makes such a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge difference.</v>

2080
01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:29.993
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I discovered recently is a double </v>

2081
01:36:32.221 --> 01:36:35.970
<v Speaker 6>zero wheat pasta from Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Double Zero.</v>

2082
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.310
<v Speaker 6>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most folks don't.</v>

2084
01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now Double Zeros.</v>

2085
01:36:39.721 --> 01:36:42.240
<v Speaker 6>What you use for pizza dough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:36:42.450 --> 01:36:43.890
<v Speaker 6>The good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right stuff,</v>

2087
01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.530
<v Speaker 6>and I also found out about heirloom </v>
<v Speaker 6>wheat,</v>

2088
01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.813
<v Speaker 6>heirloom wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that most of what we're getting here in </v>

2089
01:36:51.361 --> 01:36:55.590
<v Speaker 6>the United States of good old Morocco is</v>
<v Speaker 6>a wheat that has been.</v>

2090
01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.740
<v Speaker 6>People love that term GMO.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2091
01:36:57.810 --> 01:37:00.570
<v Speaker 6>It scares the shit out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gmos.</v>

2092
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:02.130
<v Speaker 6>Super Organic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:03.600
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All good thoughts.</v>

2094
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.480
<v Speaker 6>But the reality is most of the wheat we </v>
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

2095
01:37:06.481 --> 01:37:07.314
<v Speaker 6>according to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know maynard Kenyan from tool </v>

2096
01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.710
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 6>the singer of the singer.</v>

2097
01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.450
<v Speaker 6>He also owns a this great vineyard </v>
<v Speaker 6>owner,</v>

2098
01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.480
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2099
01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.100
<v Speaker 6>And a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2100
01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:21.300
<v Speaker 6>She was explaining to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He explained it on the podcast about the</v>

2101
01:37:21.301 --> 01:37:24.690
<v Speaker 6>differences between the wheat we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>today and the original wheat.</v>

2102
01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:29.040
<v Speaker 6>The wheat we have today has much more </v>
<v Speaker 6>complex gluten's in it and it's a larger</v>

2103
01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.820
<v Speaker 6>yield for the same area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when they would grow the old wheat,</v>

2104
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.470
<v Speaker 6>they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't make as much of it,</v>

2105
01:37:34.471 --> 01:37:36.240
<v Speaker 6>but it was easier for a person to </v>
<v Speaker 6>digest.</v>

2106
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.440
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2107
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2108
01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:40.194
<v Speaker 4>There's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many of these little farmers </v>

2109
01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.290
<v Speaker 4>and little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some are pretty big for being little,</v>

2110
01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:48.270
<v Speaker 4>but compared to what these giant things </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2111
01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.033
<v Speaker 4>they really concentrate on growing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat the way they used to be grown and </v>

2112
01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>then the mill it the way it was.</v>

2113
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 5>Seeds though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2114
01:37:57.751 --> 01:37:59.850
<v Speaker 5>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes such a difference.</v>

2115
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Like just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2116
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:02.334
<v Speaker 5>how big of a difference can it be just </v>
<v Speaker 5>in making the bread that I'm making a </v>

2117
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:08.100
<v Speaker 5>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine it tastes like,</v>

2118
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.380
<v Speaker 5>like to lie natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2119
01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 5>It's earthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's deep.</v>

2120
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:14.130
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earthy,</v>

2121
01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:17.280
<v Speaker 5>earthy is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it made a big difference,</v>

2122
01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:18.114
<v Speaker 5>but now I've got to figure out how I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to store 50 pounds of 100 pounds </v>

2123
01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:21.174
<v Speaker 5>of flour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd probably have to do it in a </v>

2124
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:22.920
<v Speaker 5>controlled environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2125
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to just put it in barrels.</v>

2126
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.890
<v Speaker 5>Does it have to be dry and air or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.053
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's good for a long time when you </v>

2128
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 5>do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

2130
01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.233
<v Speaker 5>I'm still learning and cranking out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot and giving it away and stuff and so </v>

2131
01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:39.594
<v Speaker 5>I'm going through a lot and won't sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever the way it's been described to </v>

2132
01:38:42.271 --> 01:38:43.104
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the differences between the difference </v>

2133
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.840
<v Speaker 5>of like a tomato that you get in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>grocery store today,</v>

2134
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:51.740
<v Speaker 5>even a good one in comparison to an </v>
<v Speaker 5>heirloom tomato makes perfect sense that</v>

2135
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.593
<v Speaker 5>those tomatoes that we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Neil degrasse Tyson did a speech </v>

2136
01:38:55.261 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 5>about this where someone was asking him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a speech,</v>

2137
01:38:57.691 --> 01:38:58.770
<v Speaker 5>but the answer to a question.</v>

2138
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:00.323
<v Speaker 5>I think it might've been in one of those</v>
<v Speaker 5>talks that he does those town hall talk </v>

2139
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.133
<v Speaker 5>and someone was asking him about Gmos </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said virtually everything we eat </v>

2140
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.790
<v Speaker 5>has been modified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.693
<v Speaker 5>Everything from the oranges to the corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you wouldn't go want to go back to </v>

2142
01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:17.550
<v Speaker 5>the original corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't taste good.</v>

2143
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:18.423
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be a lot of yield to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then the real problem is the corn </v>

2144
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:24.570
<v Speaker 5>that we have today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that easy for us to digest.</v>

2145
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not that good to eat a lot of it,</v>

2146
01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all like how much of it do you use?</v>

2147
01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you do eat a tomato,</v>

2148
01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:33.744
<v Speaker 5>like an heirloom tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a farmer's market that this guy </v>

2149
01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 5>grew in this tiny little farm and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens to have them that week.</v>

2150
01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal.</v>

2151
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:42.330
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think that's the same with </v>
<v Speaker 5>corn.</v>

2152
01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:43.523
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that golden sweet corn that we </v>

2153
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:47.310
<v Speaker 5>have today that tastes like candy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the best shit.</v>

2154
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:50.480
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2155
01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 1>you put butter on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2156
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Wrap it in aluminum foil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put It on the grill.</v>

2157
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit ass original pine cone.</v>

2162
01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still weird colored.</v>

2163
01:40:19.491 --> 01:40:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And he asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>

2164
01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.140
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Just just try and eat me if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the original corn,</v>

2166
01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2167
01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:29.040
<v Speaker 1>it adds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2168
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:29.770
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2169
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2170
01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people put.</v>

2171
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:32.623
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

2172
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.693
<v Speaker 1>Cornell ooky corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children of the corn at some spooky </v>

2173
01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:40.041
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2174
01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:43.340
<v Speaker 1>They ever seen the original corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find original</v>

2175
01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.233
<v Speaker 5>corn plant images.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still want to know how much tobacco </v>

2176
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:49.550
<v Speaker 5>rowers get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't find much.</v>

2177
01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.413
<v Speaker 5>The only thing I found was an article </v>
<v Speaker 5>about a guy that just started a </v>

2178
01:40:52.581 --> 01:40:53.414
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It said somewhere in there that are as </v>

2179
01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:55.864
<v Speaker 5>cheap as they could be made was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>thirty cents a piece and it was </v>

2180
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:01.090
<v Speaker 5>expensive as $5 a piece for the cigar </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

2181
01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:02.580
<v Speaker 5>It didn't say that included,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2182
01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.920
<v Speaker 5>the wells are a highly skilled wrapper </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it.</v>

2183
01:41:05.921 --> 01:41:10.090
<v Speaker 5>So it might be being paid per,</v>
<v Speaker 5>per cigar.</v>

2184
01:41:10.091 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 5>They rule fifty cents per if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing like a bunch in a row,</v>

2185
01:41:12.521 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it didn't say whoever wrote this did</v>

<v Speaker 5>a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did a fantastic job.</v>

2194
01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.400

<v Speaker 5>like bullshit.</v>

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:37.720
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2196
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:42.640
<v Speaker 5>that's the original corn is a size of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>quarter and the quarter with that.</v>

2197
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is crazy.</v>

2198
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:46.660
<v Speaker 5>The original corn versus the new corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2199
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:49.390
<v Speaker 5>That's really wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wild.</v>

2200
01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 5>And that shit was all done through like </v>
<v Speaker 5>splicing.</v>

2201
01:41:52.781 --> 01:41:53.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2202
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:56.230
<v Speaker 5>That was natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look with corn used to look like.</v>

2203
01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:57.173
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it looks like the route </v>

2204
01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:03.541
<v Speaker 5>that came out of your toilet to small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big modern corn looks like the route.</v>

2205
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:07.030
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2206
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:07.864
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>corn used to be this tiny little low </v>

2207
01:42:09.311 --> 01:42:11.370
<v Speaker 5>yield product.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2208
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 5>that's jelly bean corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Glass gem corn glass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gem Corn.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2211
01:42:19.121 --> 01:42:21.010
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can't be good.</v>

2212
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise people would eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

2213
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 5>You ever get a cotton candy?</v>

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Grapes.</v>

2215
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:28.301
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black.</v>

2216
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Waxy corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's black?</v>

2217
01:42:30.671 --> 01:42:31.780
<v Speaker 5>Waxy corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

2218
01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 5>that looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks pretty good.</v>

2219
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.290
<v Speaker 5>It looks like licorice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you bite into it,</v>

2220
01:42:36.291 --> 01:42:38.050
<v Speaker 5>which is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would eat that.</v>

2221
01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 5>I would eat dead too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think that like if you went over</v>

2222
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 5>a clever person's house to interview </v>
<v Speaker 5>that black corn,</v>

2223
01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience even better.</v>

2224
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 5>What are those purple potatoes come from</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peru,</v>

2225
01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:48.694
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably the same area as this I </v>

2226
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:53.410
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it Peruvian purple potatoes and that.</v>

2227
01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that one.</v>

2228
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.593
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That looks like the alien from the </v>

2229
01:42:57.071 --> 01:42:58.460
<v Speaker 5>Geiger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's Dick.</v>

2230
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:00.833
<v Speaker 5>Go back to that.</v>

2231
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:06.700
<v Speaker 5>The tongue comes out and fucked his </v>
<v Speaker 5>jabs.</v>

2232
01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:10.510
<v Speaker 5>You in the head with that and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shoots the baby into your body.</v>

2233
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:12.343
<v Speaker 5>You just within your just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating dinner like in the wrong sport </v>

2234
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:18.550
<v Speaker 5>grows out of your dead body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that,</v>

2235
01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:21.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the corn didn't.</v>

2236
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:26.320
<v Speaker 5>I think between the original core and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being that weird Nabi thing and the corn</v>

2237
01:43:26.321 --> 01:43:29.780
<v Speaker 5>that we have year round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's probably an era in there</v>

2238
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.300
<v Speaker 5>were the corn tasted better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2239
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:34.203
<v Speaker 5>Like the life of the taiga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the evolution of human beings to </v>

2240
01:43:37.271 --> 01:43:40.150
<v Speaker 5>technological superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where we're at today,</v>

2241
01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 5>you got to meet it halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the sweet spot.</v>

2242
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 5>The sweet spot where there's no stopping</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2243
01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 5>He's no stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're moving forward,</v>

2244
01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:51.800
<v Speaker 5>there's no stopping it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe this spot is not sweet spot.</v>

2245
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Just like living in a cave wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking sweet spot.</v>

2246
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:57.050
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just a sweet spot for the time.</v>

2247
01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:57.913
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now you don't want to go live on </v>

2248
01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 5>the tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2249
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:02.690
<v Speaker 5>Tom Pump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

2250
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:03.850
<v Speaker 5>You can't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2251
01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 5>It'd be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are you going to bake your bread?</v>

2252
01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:07.510
<v Speaker 5>Am I going to make bread?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Flour.</v>

2253
01:44:07.511 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 5>You gonna have to grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2254
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.140
<v Speaker 5>You've got to mill your own bread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you manage?</v>

2255
01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:13.310
<v Speaker 5>If you had to grow your own fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>wheat to make your bread?</v>

2256
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would never make bread with judo.</v>

2257
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.090
<v Speaker 5>May probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'll plant the seed right now.</v>

2258
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:20.983
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're gonna leave here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be driving home your </v>

2259
01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.620
<v Speaker 5>electric car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be thinking,</v>

2260
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:26.390
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

2261
01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:27.224
<v Speaker 5>All this comedy bullshit when I do is </v>
<v Speaker 5>get a big piece of land and start </v>

2262
01:44:30.261 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 5>growing my own wheat and then chopping </v>
<v Speaker 5>it down,</v>

2263
01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:36.050
<v Speaker 5>make my own bread and have Tom Papa's </v>
<v Speaker 5>bread restaurant.</v>

2264
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:41.470
<v Speaker 5>I've given this a lot of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have something,</v>

2265
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.393
<v Speaker 5>so not about throwing it all away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something about a going </v>

2266
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:52.610
<v Speaker 5>bigger and deeper into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of just draws you in.</v>

2267
01:44:52.730 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even making decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just like,</v>

2268
01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:56.373
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I'm getting bigger things of flour </v>

2269
01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 5>and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2270
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 5>there's something very all consuming </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2271
01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's good.</v>

2272
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:07.963
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you get something that gets </v>

2273
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:09.623
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's rewarding and I like that it's </v>

2274
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:12.470
<v Speaker 5>small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that it's,</v>

2275
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 5>there's no bullshit around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no phone calls to be made.</v>

2276
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 5>It's just all on my own terms but does </v>
<v Speaker 5>in my control.</v>

2277
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:20.774
<v Speaker 5>Does that appeal to you as an overall </v>
<v Speaker 5>life or does it appeal to you as a </v>

2278
01:45:23.931 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 5>vacation from the current life that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy?</v>

2279
01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Which is very hectic and kinda stressful</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing material,</v>

2280
01:45:30.591 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 5>performing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>traveling.</v>

2281
01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.900
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is?</v>

2282
01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.170
<v Speaker 5>I feel like A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2283
01:45:36.171 --> 01:45:37.004
<v Speaker 5>It's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do feel like the process of making it </v>

2284
01:45:39.621 --> 01:45:44.621
<v Speaker 5>and doing it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It matches up with writing really well.</v>

2285
01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:46.543
<v Speaker 5>When I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm at home and I'm writing a lot </v>

2286
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:53.060
<v Speaker 5>and in between taking breaks and going </v>
<v Speaker 5>and tending to the bread and then coming</v>

2287
01:45:53.061 --> 01:45:56.780
<v Speaker 5>back to the writing that back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 5>is very satisfying.</v>

2288
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is the best.</v>

2289
01:45:58.710 --> 01:45:59.810
<v Speaker 5>That was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:01.063
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I often thought writing in some ways </v>

2291
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:05.990
<v Speaker 5>releases you from the stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people find a performing.</v>

2292
01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:08.120
<v Speaker 5>The just writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:46:08.121 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 5>I heard nor Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that on his,</v>

2294
01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:11.174
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on his show that he just wants to write </v>

2295
01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:15.110
<v Speaker 5>books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just wants to write that before.</v>

2296
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that before where people just</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go internal and stop being.</v>

2297
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:20.930
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I former,</v>

2298
01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.220
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2299
01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't do that 100 percent.</v>

2300
01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:25.990
<v Speaker 5>I really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this.</v>

2301
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.640
<v Speaker 5>My Book's gonna come out next year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a plug.</v>

2302
01:46:28.641 --> 01:46:31.460
<v Speaker 5>I see what you did sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even buy it yet,</v>

2303
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 5>but it is coming out soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be planting seeds,</v>

2304
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:37.400
<v Speaker 5>a planting seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeds for people to buy the book.</v>

2305
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:39.410
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're doing and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

2306
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:41.530
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I'm plugging my Gig at </v>
<v Speaker 5>comics.</v>

2307
01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.260
<v Speaker 5>He can sign or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2308
01:46:43.261 --> 01:46:44.810
<v Speaker 5>you there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when is that?</v>

2309
01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 5>It's coming up next week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2310
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:47.750
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2311
01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I,</v>

2312
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 5>when I was</v>

2313
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 4>writing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got very deep into an I love coming in</v>

2314
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 4>with my coffee in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to work for hours just in there,</v>

2315
01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 4>tinkering with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing with it.</v>

2316
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.480
<v Speaker 4>It was very satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense,</v>

2317
01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:04.770
<v Speaker 4>but after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after several days of not being onstage,</v>

2318
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 4>start getting itchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he get itchy.</v>

2319
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:08.430
<v Speaker 4>It's not who I am.</v>

2320
01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.040
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that it's that you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced these jolts of fun,</v>

2321
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:15.343
<v Speaker 6>that you get from standup,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you become addicted to these jolts </v>

2322
01:47:18.111 --> 01:47:22.370
<v Speaker 6>of fun and then seeing the happiness and</v>
<v Speaker 6>people's faces when they're laughing?</v>

2323
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That relating to people,</v>

2324
01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 4>that isolation of writing is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but until I can take that idea out,</v>

2325
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.640
<v Speaker 4>share it with other human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm.</v>

2326
01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:41.410
<v Speaker 6>For what you've designed yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2327
01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Sort of like you look at the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've,</v>

2328
01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.710
<v Speaker 6>we've grown to this place where if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>made people like,</v>

2329
01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.410
<v Speaker 6>were you here during the heatwave?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:51.911
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Weird,</v>

2331
01:47:51.911 --> 01:47:52.744
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2332
01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 6>It was intense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It got intense.</v>

2333
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:56.740
<v Speaker 6>It was a little spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

2334
01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:59.290
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because like really people were on edge.</v>

2335
01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:00.183
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2336
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:02.920
<v Speaker 6>quietly on edge waiting for the AC to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

2337
01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.490
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the AC goes down,</v>

2338
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:07.000
<v Speaker 6>where are we going to deal with this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because this is not.</v>

2339
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:09.490
<v Speaker 6>You have to just get in the shower all </v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

2340
01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:10.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2341
01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.650
<v Speaker 6>it's intense when it's only got 110.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:15.760
<v Speaker 6>You can stay in the shade and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 6>stay reasonably cool,</v>

2343
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.100
<v Speaker 6>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way hotter than you want it to be.</v>

2344
01:48:18.101 --> 01:48:19.180
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not sleeping,</v>

2345
01:48:19.181 --> 01:48:20.014
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2346
01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:21.460
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sweating like a pig.</v>

2347
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the people in Florida right now.</v>

2348
01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:26.770
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

2349
01:48:27.010 --> 01:48:28.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's humid.</v>

2350
01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.200
<v Speaker 6>Hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2351
01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:31.660
<v Speaker 6>Fans blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2352
01:48:31.661 --> 01:48:33.690
<v Speaker 6>It's not good feeling where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2353
01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.120
<v Speaker 6>I've always thought no disrespect people</v>
<v Speaker 6>from Florida,</v>

2354
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:38.223
<v Speaker 6>but that's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 6>think of people that live in the south </v>

2355
01:48:41.201 --> 01:48:42.034
<v Speaker 6>as being dull because the thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>longest time before they invented air </v>

2356
01:48:46.391 --> 01:48:48.130
<v Speaker 6>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2357
01:48:48.131 --> 01:48:49.930
<v Speaker 6>those fucking people didn't have time to</v>
<v Speaker 6>think.</v>

2358
01:48:49.931 --> 01:48:50.764
<v Speaker 6>Deep core move quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not going to think your best </v>

2359
01:48:54.311 --> 01:48:57.370
<v Speaker 6>thoughts when you fucking sweating like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a pig and you're exhausted all the time.</v>

2360
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.460
<v Speaker 6>Why getting the power back on in Florida</v>
<v Speaker 6>could take weeks.</v>

2361
01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:03.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that.</v>

2362
01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.530
<v Speaker 6>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is rough weeks.</v>

2363
01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:10.390
<v Speaker 6>Why'd you bring up that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why'd you bring up the,</v>

2364
01:49:10.391 --> 01:49:13.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it was here during the heat wave</v>

2365
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.073
<v Speaker 6>because it was so evident to me during </v>
<v Speaker 6>that time that we really can't even </v>

2366
01:49:17.921 --> 01:49:18.754
<v Speaker 6>exist in this environment without the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way we do and enjoy the way we live </v>

2367
01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:23.763
<v Speaker 6>without the modern conveniences of </v>
<v Speaker 6>electrical grid air conditioning units </v>

2368
01:49:30.161 --> 01:49:30.994
<v Speaker 6>and the delivery of food and all this </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit that we just get like super </v>

2369
01:49:33.701 --> 01:49:34.534
<v Speaker 6>accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we think now of life without that </v>

2370
01:49:39.221 --> 01:49:42.610
<v Speaker 6>stuff as being like impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But at one point in time we were adapted</v>

2371
01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.073
<v Speaker 6>one point in time life without that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like those fucking people that live in </v>

2372
01:49:46.151 --> 01:49:46.984
<v Speaker 6>the taiga,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the worst it gets for them as it gets </v>

2373
01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:49.174
<v Speaker 6>crazy cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they bundle up and they go inside and </v>

2374
01:49:51.011 --> 01:49:51.844
<v Speaker 6>they burn wood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they have like a whole system built </v>

2375
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 6>in to survive that environment.</v>

2376
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 6>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be unthinkable.</v>

2377
01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 6>Like your house doesn't have central Ac,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have heat,</v>

2378
01:50:02.171 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 6>you don't have a thermostat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>

2379
01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.380
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hold on.</v>

2380
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:06.383
<v Speaker 6>See Walk in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That thing doesn't glow in the wall and </v>

2381
01:50:08.471 --> 01:50:10.280
<v Speaker 6>show you the temperature you've walked </v>
<v Speaker 6>by.</v>

2382
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:12.200
<v Speaker 6>It exists things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.710
<v Speaker 6>It's not programmed where it's Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 6>knows I'm home.</v>

2384
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:15.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A friend of mine's house,</v>

2385
01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:19.480
<v Speaker 6>you walk towards his thermostat and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>lights up.</v>

2386
01:50:19.481 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 6>It senses your senses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're there,</v>

2387
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.250
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey.</v>

2388
01:50:23.251 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shows you the temperature,</v>

2389
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 6>like it's off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you'll step away.</v>

2390
01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:26.953
<v Speaker 6>It'll dim up and he's standing right in </v>
<v Speaker 6>front of it and it lights and like this </v>

2391
01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:30.170
<v Speaker 6>is freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:31.900
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People don't have that man.</v>

2393
01:50:31.901 --> 01:50:33.040
<v Speaker 6>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Windows does shut.</v>

2394
01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They fire.</v>

2395
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:37.600
<v Speaker 6>Fire keeps the heat in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bundle up.</v>

2396
01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:41.350
<v Speaker 6>Now I couldn't put animal skins on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 6>That's what people do now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not doing that.</v>

2398
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:44.523
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>

2399
01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:47.350
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we've adapted for sure to this.</v>

2400
01:50:47.351 --> 01:50:49.690
<v Speaker 6>You and I have adapted to this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The question is,</v>

2401
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:52.060
<v Speaker 6>who's happier?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's it better?</v>

2402
01:50:52.061 --> 01:50:52.760
<v Speaker 6>Is it better?</v>

2403
01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:53.593
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty happy when I walk in after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after that heat wave and I would walk </v>

2404
01:50:56.081 --> 01:50:56.914
<v Speaker 4>into my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take your shoes off and your bare </v>

2405
01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.800
<v Speaker 4>feet on the cold tile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty happy.</v>

2406
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm happier than the tiger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:08.420
<v Speaker 6>Watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All these hurricanes brewing in the goal</v>

2408
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.883
<v Speaker 6>G.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.850
<v Speaker 4>But I've found that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2410
01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.110
<v Speaker 4>that writing is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2411
01:51:15.111 --> 01:51:16.700
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I was writing,</v>

2412
01:51:16.701 --> 01:51:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I was reading a lot of writers and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's very isolating.</v>

2413
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Like the more you write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you are shutting out the world,</v>

2414
01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.570
<v Speaker 4>the more you are you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hermit's life.</v>

2415
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.720
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

2416
01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:29.210
<v Speaker 4>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

2417
01:51:29.211 --> 01:51:30.044
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are very much within your own head </v>

2418
01:51:32.691 --> 01:51:35.840
<v Speaker 4>and eating up a lot of time just being </v>
<v Speaker 4>by yourself.</v>

2419
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:39.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be rewarding for sure,</v>

2420
01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:39.974
<v Speaker 4>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were to write all the time like </v>

2421
01:51:42.681 --> 01:51:44.270
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty isolating.</v>

2422
01:51:44.530 --> 01:51:46.750
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also in a lot of ways,</v>

2423
01:51:46.751 --> 01:51:49.120
<v Speaker 6>almost like a mental marathon because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2424
01:51:49.121 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 6>you're on this one thing for a long </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2425
01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 6>Sitting there staring at this thing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're writing and you're thinking about</v>

2426
01:51:56.501 --> 01:51:57.334
<v Speaker 6>it and you're focusing on it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going back at it and you thinking about </v>

2427
01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:00.364
<v Speaker 6>it and you focus on becomes like a part </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your daily thoughts even when you're </v>

2428
01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 6>not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes.</v>

2429
01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:09.500
<v Speaker 4>What was really remarkable was when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're writing your standup in blocks,</v>

2430
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:11.383
<v Speaker 4>it's like chunks and I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how am I going to keep track of like a </v>

2431
01:52:14.821 --> 01:52:19.260
<v Speaker 4>whole book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your subconscious really does like I</v>

2432
01:52:19.261 --> 01:52:23.520
<v Speaker 4>know exactly where things are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would glide through it and no,</v>

2433
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.860
<v Speaker 4>I think I have to change this part and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see on my notes.</v>

2434
01:52:25.861 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Yes indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is where I was going to change it.</v>

2435
01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:29.213
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain starts to take in all that </v>

2436
01:52:33.691 --> 01:52:36.570
<v Speaker 4>information and treat it like chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2437
01:52:36.571 --> 01:52:38.940
<v Speaker 4>It's no different really than writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your standup.</v>

2438
01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:40.613
<v Speaker 4>Do you.</v>

2439
01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.710
<v Speaker 6>Do you take notes like chapter chapter </v>
<v Speaker 6>notes,</v>

2440
01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.400
<v Speaker 6>like you have like a notebook that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have sitting on the side</v>

2441
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:47.293
<v Speaker 5>and you like say chapter one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's all the things that I like or </v>

2442
01:52:49.401 --> 01:52:50.234
<v Speaker 5>don't like or not that specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if there's something that I can't </v>

2443
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 5>wrestle to the ground and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta fix that ending.</v>

2444
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I'll just write on the side Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>page 35,</v>

2445
01:52:59.410 --> 01:53:00.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then keep going.</v>

2446
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 5>And you writing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>

2447
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:08.630
<v Speaker 5>what's the subject of the book?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a funny essays about family life.</v>

2448
01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's all just different.</v>

2449
01:53:10.521 --> 01:53:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Different chapters about everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your family,</v>

2450
01:53:12.681 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 5>your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your kids,</v>

2451
01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:15.530
<v Speaker 5>your uncles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cousins,</v>

2452
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:20.710
<v Speaker 5>everything that makes up family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's all these little,</v>

2453
01:53:21.190 --> 01:53:26.190
<v Speaker 5>they're like 300 pages and each one is </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably four pages,</v>

2454
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:28.400
<v Speaker 5>five pages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2455
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:33.500
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been working on it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little over a year.</v>

2456
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:34.820
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:38.810
<v Speaker 5>And it's like this week it goes back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it back.</v>

2458
01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>

2459
01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:40.250
<v Speaker 5>This is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.550
<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:43.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Done.</v>

2462
01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like sick of it.</v>

2463
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.843
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2464
01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.190
<v Speaker 5>pretty proud of parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every time you look at it,</v>

2465
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:50.960
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did I let that go?</v>

2466
01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:52.820
<v Speaker 5>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is so corny.</v>

2467
01:53:52.930 --> 01:53:55.280
<v Speaker 5>How did I let that joke in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2468
01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.593
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you find that sometimes you have an </v>

2469
01:53:57.711 --> 01:53:59.300
<v Speaker 5>idea that you're not getting out </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally,</v>

2470
01:53:59.301 --> 01:54:00.134
<v Speaker 5>but you leave it as is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a place holder and you review it </v>

2471
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 5>later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2472
01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe you feel like there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something in this idea,</v>

2473
01:54:06.081 --> 01:54:08.030
<v Speaker 5>but whatever I have right now is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:10.870
<v Speaker 5>But maybe there's something if I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave it there like that,</v>

2475
01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.260
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'll come at it from a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>angle,</v>

2476
01:54:12.261 --> 01:54:15.410
<v Speaker 5>but at least then I know to think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this one subject that I thought had some</v>

2477
01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:15.860
<v Speaker 5>promise.</v>

2478
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent,</v>

2479
01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:21.080
<v Speaker 5>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I really feel like it kind of taught</v>

2480
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:26.081
<v Speaker 5>me how much your subconscious goes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>work on it without you being conscious.</v>

2481
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't realize that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>is actually going,</v>

2482
01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.080
<v Speaker 5>it's going to work on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you shut out,</v>

2483
01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.350
<v Speaker 5>shut the computer and walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think that's it?</v>

2484
01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:37.753
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is still going at it without </v>
<v Speaker 5>you even being aware that it's </v>

2485
01:54:41.151 --> 01:54:41.984
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ever read Stephen King on writing a </v>

2486
01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:45.620
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great book.</v>

2487
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.330
<v Speaker 5>The things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I thought was the most</v>

2488
01:54:47.331 --> 01:54:51.150
<v Speaker 5>shocking was that he doesn't really like</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a,</v>

2489
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:54.710
<v Speaker 5>like a whole outline of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>started writing them.</v>

2490
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:57.440
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just as an idea and just go,</v>

2491
01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.390
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is brilliant.</v>

2492
01:54:59.450 --> 01:55:01.580
<v Speaker 5>You fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotTa Trust Yourself.</v>

2493
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 5>You just gotta you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2494
01:55:03.771 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 5>he's a brilliant mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2495
01:55:05.661 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his books were thought of as like fluff,</v>

2496
01:55:09.110 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 5>but if you read Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you weren't really reading.</v>

2497
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:12.920
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 5>well that happens when you're really </v>
<v Speaker 5>popular.</v>

2499
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:17.420
<v Speaker 5>It was a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2500
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:18.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was also that,</v>

2501
01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.480
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just reading monster stories.</v>

2502
01:55:20.481 --> 01:55:21.314
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He should be reading about depressed </v>

2503
01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:24.780
<v Speaker 5>heroin users.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you'd be like,</v>

2504
01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:26.083
<v Speaker 5>exact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep.</v>

2505
01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Middle aged crisis in Europe,</v>

2506
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2507
01:55:29.031 --> 01:55:29.864
<v Speaker 5>this is alphabet city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the 19 sixties these people were </v>

2508
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:35.270
<v Speaker 5>doing smack you listening to Lou Reed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and punching each other.</v>

2509
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 5>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2510
01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:38.024
<v Speaker 5>how you ever go to the bookstore and </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the Stephen King Section in the </v>

2511

<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2534
01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 6>Point where you want her to make those </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids heads explode.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He made really created the ultimate </v>

2539
01:56:56.371 --> 01:56:59.430
<v Speaker 6>outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some poor kid that was unfortunate to be</v>

2540
01:56:59.431 --> 01:57:02.650
<v Speaker 6>born into a situation where a mother was</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely psychotic cunt.</v>

2541
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:03.583
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people were trying to fucking throw </v>

2542
01:57:05.071 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 6>a pig's blood honor and run her over </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a car.</v>

2543
01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:08.250
<v Speaker 6>So mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.530
<v Speaker 6>But she and she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they faked that fucking handsome guy was</v>

2545
01:57:12.531 --> 01:57:15.540
<v Speaker 6>going to go to the prom with her dump </v>
<v Speaker 6>blood on her and they all thought it was</v>

2546
01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:16.374
<v Speaker 6>fun and they were laughing at her and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she got back and I'm all because we </v>

2547
01:57:19.471 --> 01:57:20.304
<v Speaker 6>realized that for the worst case </v>
<v Speaker 6>scenario for a human is someone that </v>

2548
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:29.391
<v Speaker 6>could do that to some poor misfortunate </v>
<v Speaker 6>girl like carry without killing her.</v>

2549
01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:33.510
<v Speaker 6>These are the worst people that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could imagine.</v>

2550
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:38.770
<v Speaker 6>She had this fucking ace in the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Power they never saw coming.</v>

2551
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 6>Fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So great.</v>

2552
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:44.970
<v Speaker 6>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's good hazing.</v>

2553
01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:47.160
<v Speaker 6>But I remember people telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all fluff.</v>

2554
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:51.040
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pet cemetery must shining.</v>

2555
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 6>Read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shaming is not fluff.</v>

2556
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.490
<v Speaker 6>It's not fluff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not flopping.</v>

2557
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 6>Book is fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2558
01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 6>And the book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy goes crazy slow.</v>

2559
01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:01.813
<v Speaker 6>It takes a while.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what he didn't like about the </v>

2560
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 6>original Jack Nicholson version,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Kubrick version,</v>

2561
01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:09.390
<v Speaker 6>which is fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was a different story.</v>

2562
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:10.403
<v Speaker 6>I can see the argument that that story </v>
<v Speaker 6>was more adaptable to a film that takes </v>

2563
01:58:13.801 --> 01:58:14.440
<v Speaker 6>place over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2564
01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.950
<v Speaker 6>two plus hours or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas his book,</v>

2565
01:58:17.770 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 6>it would have to be like a 30 hour </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>

2566
01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a long process of Jack.</v>

2567
01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:24.530
<v Speaker 6>Maybe 30 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2568
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When he really starts going nuts and the</v>

2569
01:58:27.061 --> 01:58:32.061
<v Speaker 6>family realizes he's actually losing his</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking mind and taken over by something</v>

2570
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 6>that lives in this house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good.</v>

2571
01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.510
<v Speaker 6>He felt like Jack Nicholson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

2572
01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:41.030
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his criticism,</v>

2573
01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.750
<v Speaker 6>the Jack Nicholson seemed crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately.</v>

2574
01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was already crazy.</v>

2575
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:49.330
<v Speaker 6>Like either hurt the kid wants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When he was drinking,</v>

2576
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 6>he was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that was in the book,</v>

2577
01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:51.874
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that Jack Nicholson's character was </v>

2578
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:54.874
<v Speaker 6>too crazy right away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't enough of a transition like </v>

2579
01:58:58.830 --> 01:59:00.990
<v Speaker 6>was Chad and Chad</v>

2580
01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:03.500
<v Speaker 4>just check the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2581
01:59:03.501 --> 01:59:08.390
<v Speaker 4>the one thing I took away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from his book on writing was,</v>

2582
01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:10.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just get to the end,</v>

2583
01:59:10.101 --> 01:59:11.720
<v Speaker 4>don't share it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't talk about it,</v>

2584
01:59:11.721 --> 01:59:14.180
<v Speaker 4>just keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to the end,</v>

2585
01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:18.890
<v Speaker 4>don't judge yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just get to the end and then start going</v>

2586
01:59:18.891 --> 01:59:20.700
<v Speaker 4>to work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2587
01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:24.370
<v Speaker 4>that really was helpful getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of this because.</v>

2588
01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.213
<v Speaker 4>And then it actually became really fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>going back and fixing it and fixing it </v>

2589
01:59:28.851 --> 01:59:30.980
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even like just the clarity,</v>

2590
01:59:30.981 --> 01:59:32.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just make it simple.</v>

2591
01:59:32.901 --> 01:59:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Just make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get this message across,</v>

2592
01:59:35.391 --> 01:59:38.870
<v Speaker 4>like why am I taking three paragraphs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeating myself,</v>

2593
01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:42.500
<v Speaker 4>pare it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peel it off,</v>

2594
01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:44.940
<v Speaker 4>make it clear for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the reader.</v>

2595
01:59:44.941 --> 01:59:47.840
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't want to go in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make this very like,</v>

2596
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:50.330
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at times I'll read articles in the paper</v>

2597
01:59:50.331 --> 01:59:52.850
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like not understanding it.</v>

2598
01:59:53.210 --> 01:59:56.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not that I'm not understanding is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this isn't written well,</v>

2599
01:59:56.690 --> 01:59:59.120
<v Speaker 4>this isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your job.</v>

2600
01:59:59.121 --> 02:00:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Like just going back and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>clear.</v>

2601
02:00:01.161 --> 02:00:04.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean like sometimes when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit and you're like,</v>

2602
02:00:04.401 --> 02:00:08.090
<v Speaker 4>you're working on new stuff for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up and you have something,</v>

2603
02:00:08.091 --> 02:00:10.670
<v Speaker 4>it's like this big chunk and then when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done working on it,</v>

2604
02:00:10.671 --> 02:00:11.504
<v Speaker 4>it's down to like five lines [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learned how to say it so </v>

2605
02:00:14.871 --> 02:00:17.000
<v Speaker 4>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So direct.</v>

2606
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:18.283
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you realize the parts that just you </v>

2607
02:00:19.081 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 6>were enjoying them but they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>tripping you up the whole bit.</v>

2608
02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were getting in the way.</v>

2609
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:24.383
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're asking the audience to think </v>

2610
02:00:25.261 --> 02:00:26.250
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2611
02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.620
<v Speaker 4>It's just getting in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>

2612
02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:30.470
<v Speaker 6>confusing the clarity of the original </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought.</v>

2613
02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.853
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a already has this piece of paper that </v>

2614
02:00:33.711 --> 02:00:34.544
<v Speaker 6>he has glued to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This keyboard that's a hemingway quotes </v>

2615
02:00:36.951 --> 02:00:38.870
<v Speaker 6>is the first draft of everything is </v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

2616
02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.550
<v Speaker 6>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2617
02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:42.140
<v Speaker 6>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It takes the pressure off.</v>

2618
02:00:42.230 --> 02:00:43.220
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also real.</v>

2619
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:44.463
<v Speaker 6>It's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really just get it out there and don't </v>

2620
02:00:45.681 --> 02:00:47.750
<v Speaker 6>think that it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Hemingway writing.</v>

2621
02:00:47.751 --> 02:00:48.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2622
02:00:48.710 --> 02:00:50.060
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his first draft was shit.</v>

2623
02:00:50.061 --> 02:00:53.090
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my little stuff is going to end up shit.</v>

2624
02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:57.380
<v Speaker 6>It's like Stephen King Hemingway was </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up all the time,</v>

2625
02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.800

<v Speaker 6>I might,</v>

2636
02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.080
<v Speaker 6>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be carried,</v>

2637
02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.560
<v Speaker 6>but just he was one of those books.</v>

<v Speaker 6>writing one of the great horror books </v>

<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that used to be everybody's friend.</v>

2643
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:44.663
<v Speaker 5>So scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read that as a kid like in a summer </v>

2644
02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:51.870
<v Speaker 5>and just you were in that car with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid with the mom just like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>So he was that messed up?</v>

2648
02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was selfish.</v>

2649
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was doing everything.</v>

2650
02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.460
<v Speaker 5>When did he get clean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Years back.</v>

2651
02:02:05.730 --> 02:02:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I think his wife put the hammer down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2652
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.030
<v Speaker 5>They gave like a family and friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>staged an intervention.</v>

2653
02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:14.370
<v Speaker 5>You're around that time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2654
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:15.500
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got that bad.</v>

2655
02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:18.570
<v Speaker 5>So doesn't say see late eighties I </v>
<v Speaker 5>guess.</v>

2656
02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:19.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2657
02:02:19.111 --> 02:02:19.944
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say that he couldn't </v>

2658
02:02:21.121 --> 02:02:23.520
<v Speaker 3>have written amazing stuff without </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

2659
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:27.240
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the original stuff that he did,</v>

2660
02:02:27.241 --> 02:02:28.410
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But well,</v>

2661
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:29.263
<v Speaker 3>I mean was it that he was just fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was writing amazing stuff or was </v>

2662
02:02:33.931 --> 02:02:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it that he was writing amazing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he was fucked up.</v>

2663
02:02:36.511 --> 02:02:37.344
<v Speaker 3>But clearly it has an effect on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind and your mind is where all your </v>

2664
02:02:41.041 --> 02:02:43.530
<v Speaker 3>creativity allegedly is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2665
02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing and you're concentrating.</v>

2666
02:02:45.421 --> 02:02:47.970
<v Speaker 3>The way you're thinking about things </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly affects the work.</v>

2667
02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:48.953
<v Speaker 3>So if you're thinking about things on </v>
<v Speaker 3>coke and drinking and you got this </v>

2668
02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:52.593
<v Speaker 3>psychotic overview of life on earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interactions that people have with </v>

2669
02:02:56.071 --> 02:02:56.780
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

2670
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:59.730
<v Speaker 3>And this is what you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how you're writing influenced by</v>

2671
02:02:59.731 --> 02:03:02.190
<v Speaker 3>these drugs as a giant effect on </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>

2672
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:07.270
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But without talent to harness it and you</v>

2673
02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.571
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2674
02:03:08.571 --> 02:03:09.404
<v Speaker 5>totally get you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have that talent that he </v>

2675
02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:13.640
<v Speaker 5>has unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get just fucked up and then just</v>

2676
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:16.100
<v Speaker 5>you don't do anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sit in your room,</v>

2677
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

2678
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:22.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a real talent there that then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs influenced that.</v>

2679
02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.720
<v Speaker 5>It's manipulating that giant talent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2680
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:29.610
<v Speaker 3>you could also say the same about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of great comics like Kennison and prior,</v>

2681
02:03:29.970 --> 02:03:33.750
<v Speaker 3>obviously they had a great relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad relationship with some drugs,</v>

2682
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:38.040
<v Speaker 3>but there were also fucking super </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented on top of that for sure.</v>

2683
02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:39.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2684
02:03:39.061 --> 02:03:40.710
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2685
02:03:40.711 --> 02:03:43.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are your thoughts and where,</v>

2686
02:03:43.171 --> 02:03:44.004
<v Speaker 3>where are these coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they coming from the environment </v>

2687
02:03:46.831 --> 02:03:49.800
<v Speaker 3>that you live in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things you've been exposed to,</v>

2688
02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:51.870
<v Speaker 3>the pros and the cons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goods and the bads.</v>

2689
02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:53.950
<v Speaker 5>He'll be here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you have,</v>

2690
02:03:53.951 --> 02:03:56.200
<v Speaker 5>but I'll ask it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you ever hear,</v>

2691
02:03:56.201 --> 02:03:59.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm a singer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>songwriters.</v>

2692
02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.510
<v Speaker 5>Talk about where the songs come from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Privilege.</v>

2693
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

2694
02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:09.630
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times they talk about catching </v>
<v Speaker 5>them out of the air that they're there.</v>

2695
02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.710
<v Speaker 5>They weren't like they didn't come from </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

2696
02:04:11.711 --> 02:04:16.000
<v Speaker 5>They all have this overwhelming feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it came from somewhere else.</v>

2697
02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.740
<v Speaker 5>What do you make of that?</v>

2698
02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:19.010
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think they,</v>

2699
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven pinker calls it the muse.</v>

2700
02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:24.540
<v Speaker 3>He uses the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muse or the,</v>

2701
02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:25.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the muse and that even if </v>

2702
02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:31.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a real muse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some sort of a guardian thing,</v>

2703
02:04:31.641 --> 02:04:32.474
<v Speaker 3>but treat it like it is with respect to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like show up to work in that musical </v>

2704
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:37.710
<v Speaker 3>show up more often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2705
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.843
<v Speaker 6>tune it in and have it come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think it comes back to what we're </v>

2706
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:43.860
<v Speaker 6>saying about ego and like getting out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>your own way.</v>

2707
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 6>Like sometimes when you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're so immersed in these thoughts and</v>

2708
02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 6>these ideas that you are out of your own</v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

2709
02:04:49.610 --> 02:04:53.220
<v Speaker 6>that that tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then the booze and the coke and the weed</v>

2710
02:04:53.221 --> 02:04:54.054
<v Speaker 6>or whatever the fuck you're doing helps </v>
<v Speaker 6>you stay in that crazy zone of just </v>

2711
02:04:56.941 --> 02:04:57.774
<v Speaker 6>letting these ideas sort of create </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves in your mind and letting the </v>

2712
02:05:01.221 --> 02:05:02.054
<v Speaker 6>story play itself out in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how much of it is from within your </v>

2713
02:05:05.371 --> 02:05:08.430
<v Speaker 6>brain and how much is it in the ether?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good question.</v>

2714
02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.910
<v Speaker 6>Does that mean and what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

2715
02:05:11.911 --> 02:05:12.744
<v Speaker 6>Floating around in the ether and letting</v>
<v Speaker 6>in you just being a thing where it can </v>

2716
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 6>kind of show up.</v>

2717
02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:18.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2718
02:05:18.151 --> 02:05:18.984
<v Speaker 6>is it just harnessing us?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean because whenever you talk about </v>

2719
02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:24.270
<v Speaker 6>meditating or even the yoga or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>

2720
02:05:24.271 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is a relationship to the universe,</v>

2721
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:29.881
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2722
02:05:29.881 --> 02:05:34.881
<v Speaker 6>It is a relationship to these forces </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are outside of ourself.</v>

2723
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is,</v>

2724
02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:40.980
<v Speaker 6>and it's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2725
02:05:40.981 --> 02:05:41.814
<v Speaker 6>every human being is a combination of so</v>
<v Speaker 6>many different experiences in genes and </v>

2726
02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:49.240
<v Speaker 6>environment and the culture they live </v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

2727
02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:50.074
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's so many different factors that </v>

2728
02:05:51.061 --> 02:05:51.894
<v Speaker 6>would effect your creativity to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many different factors that </v>

2729
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:59.150
<v Speaker 6>would affect the way unique ideas enter </v>
<v Speaker 6>into your head.</v>

2730
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:00.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2731
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:01.643
<v Speaker 6>And you know how much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much respect do you pay to those </v>

2732
02:06:02.911 --> 02:06:03.744
<v Speaker 6>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much time do you spend alone with </v>

2733
02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:05.580
<v Speaker 6>those ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2734
02:06:06.450 --> 02:06:08.370
<v Speaker 6>Can you focus on a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 6>things?</v>

2735
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:09.503
<v Speaker 6>Like if you were writing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you focus on your act and another </v>

2736
02:06:12.511 --> 02:06:13.110
<v Speaker 6>project?</v>

2737
02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard,</v>

2738
02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:14.821
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2739
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:16.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm not good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've tried that.</v>

2740
02:06:16.651 --> 02:06:18.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't do so well at that.</v>

2741
02:06:18.241 --> 02:06:22.530
<v Speaker 6>I write different things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if I have like a main project,</v>

2742
02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 6>like the main I'm trying to do a special</v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

2743
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:26.664
<v Speaker 6>The main project,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's always got to be the standup and </v>

2744
02:06:28.261 --> 02:06:31.270
<v Speaker 6>then all these other things that I write</v>
<v Speaker 6>are just fishing for more standup.</v>

2745
02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:31.950
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2746
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 6>so I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times I don't write like try to</v>

2747
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:39.030
<v Speaker 6>sit down and write a specific joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2748
02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 6>I get a joke and then I right on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>joke,</v>

2749
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 6>but I get a joke from writing blogs more</v>
<v Speaker 6>like almost like essays.</v>

2750
02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.513
<v Speaker 6>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll start thinking about a subject in </v>

2751
02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:49.284
<v Speaker 6>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not restricted to a punchline </v>

2752
02:06:50.701 --> 02:06:52.200
<v Speaker 6>format,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

2753
02:06:52.201 --> 02:06:55.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to like explore all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>different things that I think about this</v>

2754
02:06:55.801 --> 02:07:00.000
<v Speaker 6>and then I might find one or two gems in</v>
<v Speaker 6>there and then I extract those and I go,</v>

2755
02:07:00.001 --> 02:07:01.670
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well how do I get that jam?</v>

2756
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:02.963
<v Speaker 6>Turn it into how does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know there's a thought there that </v>

2757
02:07:04.591 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 6>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2758
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 6>How do I do that without all that other </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit?</v>

2759
02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.413
<v Speaker 6>How do I get to it quick?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really think that great standup is </v>

2760
02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:11.323
<v Speaker 6>like poetry because that's all pairing </v>
<v Speaker 6>you down to this one simple way to </v>

2761
02:07:15.691 --> 02:07:18.120
<v Speaker 6>deliver all of that thing in that blog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2762
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:20.430
<v Speaker 6>That's why tweets are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>

2763
02:07:20.431 --> 02:07:23.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm Ian Edwards was telling me about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2764
02:07:23.130 --> 02:07:25.890

<v Speaker 6>like really funny shit on twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that forces you to boil it down to 140 </v>

2767

<v Speaker 1>but the long drawn out stupid shit that </v>

2773
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:56.950

<v Speaker 1>the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having to write it,</v>

2784
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2817
02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's huge.</v>

2818
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Big Animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Big Wild Elk?</v>

2819
02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Thousand pounds probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's big animal.</v>

2820
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2821
02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And how long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2822
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:53.290
<v Speaker 1>did it just come where you set up in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot and it kind of crossed your path?</v>

2823
02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Was a couple of days of trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to one couple days that that's,</v>

2824
02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.650
<v Speaker 1>that's really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2825
02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's a lot more days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2826
02:10:01.721 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously sometimes you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters with an elk,</v>

2827
02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:06.203
<v Speaker 1>like your very first morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a picture of the rack on that is </v>

2828
02:10:09.311 --> 02:10:13.030
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big animal that is huge rack.</v>

2829
02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most one of the most majestic</v>

2830
02:10:17.111 --> 02:10:19.150
<v Speaker 1>of all wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>

2831
02:10:19.151 --> 02:10:19.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a mountain of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These animals get killed so often by </v>

2832
02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:30.010
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mountain lions in particular.</v>

2833
02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And how old is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think there's,</v>

2834
02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2835
02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:37.760
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long did it take to grow that rack?</v>

2836
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.630
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's really crazy?</v>

2837
02:10:38.631 --> 02:10:41.930
<v Speaker 6>They drop them off every year and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>regrow them quick every year.</v>

2838
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:42.783
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that grows that quickly within a </v>

2839
02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 6>couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2840
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 6>Really insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of the.</v>

2841
02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>It looks like it's growing things in </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature.</v>

2842
02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:53.000
<v Speaker 6>I would think that was around for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

2843
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.721
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2844
02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:54.071
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2845
02:10:54.071 --> 02:10:56.410
<v Speaker 6>they dropped those off every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2846
02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:00.230
<v Speaker 6>That's where you can tell a very </v>
<v Speaker 6>specific,</v>

2847
02:11:00.231 --> 02:11:01.064
<v Speaker 6>like there's very specific </v>
<v Speaker 6>characteristics of certain antlers and </v>

2848
02:11:03.951 --> 02:11:07.040
<v Speaker 6>you can tell by the sheds if it's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same antler,</v>

2849
02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 6>if you catch them like a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2850
02:11:09.021 --> 02:11:10.000
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

2851
02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:11.390
<v Speaker 6>one Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one arrow.</v>

2852
02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you aim for the lungs?</v>

2853
02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:16.790
<v Speaker 6>Like the vitals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lungs.</v>

2854
02:11:16.791 --> 02:11:20.330
<v Speaker 6>The heart kills him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the lungs get deflated and they die</v>

2855
02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:21.060
<v Speaker 6>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

2856
02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.360
<v Speaker 6>he fell within five seconds.</v>

2857
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.980
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>From an Arrow?</v>

2858
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then it takes a few seconds for them</v>

2859
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:28.850
<v Speaker 6>to expire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but never knew we were there.</v>

2860
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.863
<v Speaker 6>He had no idea where were there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So how long were you in the spot where </v>

2861
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:32.891
<v Speaker 6>you were?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

2862
02:11:32.891 --> 02:11:33.724
<v Speaker 6>we were trying to get to him for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of hours because he was </v>

2863
02:11:36.831 --> 02:11:37.664
<v Speaker 6>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They scream when they're trying to get </v>

2864
02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:41.180
<v Speaker 6>laid and they tried to pick up chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2865
02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:43.550
<v Speaker 6>Fight each other to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We find dead ones.</v>

2866
02:11:43.551 --> 02:11:45.000
<v Speaker 6>They're really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2867
02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:46.860
<v Speaker 6>You find them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

2868
02:11:47.090 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 6>one of them they found though had a </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountain lions,</v>

2869
02:11:49.570 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 6>a claw stuck in its head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is really crazy.</v>

2870
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.250
<v Speaker 6>You're really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2871
02:11:53.250 --> 02:11:57.860
<v Speaker 6>They found this one that had been chewed</v>
<v Speaker 6>up and uh,</v>

2872
02:11:57.920 --> 02:11:58.753
<v Speaker 6>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2873
02:11:59.050 --> 02:12:01.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I think one of them dies,</v>

2874
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 6>they want to find out like what killed </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and think that you,</v>

2875
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:06.183
<v Speaker 6>you bring the skull to like fish and </v>
<v Speaker 6>game and they do an examination on </v>

2876
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:12.300
<v Speaker 6>whatever they can to see what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 6>at the same.</v>

2877
02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 6>It was poached,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2878
02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:17.300
<v Speaker 6>sometimes people will shoot an animal </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I'm just,</v>

2879
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 6>they're not supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's people are assholes,</v>

2880
02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:20.960
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Ted Nugent,</v>

2881
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:23.150
<v Speaker 6>a place in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people are obviously,</v>

2882
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:24.403
<v Speaker 6>Ted nugent has a place in Michigan and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's this big giant fenced in deer park </v>

2883
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:33.640
<v Speaker 6>that he has hundreds of acres.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2884
02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:37.760
<v Speaker 6>one day while he was not there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone killed like all of his books.</v>

2885
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 6>So they climbed the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just shot them all and just shot him and</v>

2886
02:12:40.701 --> 02:12:41.311
<v Speaker 6>left them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:12:41.311 --> 02:12:42.144
<v Speaker 6>I just shot him and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people have done terrible things like </v>

2888
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:45.950
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think there's one,</v>

2889
02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:46.813
<v Speaker 6>they have to think about that they find </v>
<v Speaker 6>a dead one and also they have to think </v>

2890
02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:51.990
<v Speaker 6>about what's killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it a bear that's killing it?</v>

2891
02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:53.293
<v Speaker 6>Not that usual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're pretty big for a grown bear to </v>

2892
02:12:55.761 --> 02:12:56.594
<v Speaker 6>attack that bear and a grizzly bear in </v>
<v Speaker 6>America or there's no grizzlies in </v>

2893
02:13:01.281 --> 02:13:03.220
<v Speaker 6>California rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

2894
02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:06.530
<v Speaker 6>they do get jacked by grizzlies in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Wyoming really.</v>

2895
02:13:06.531 --> 02:13:07.790
<v Speaker 6>Especially their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their babies.</v>

2896
02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:08.624
<v Speaker 6>Almost all their babies would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>grizzly fight it for food or protect </v>

2897
02:13:12.711 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 6>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2898
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:14.500
<v Speaker 6>for food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2899
02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:15.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was.</v>

2900
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to protect yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 6>an elk.</v>

2901
02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:17.923
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to protect yourself from a </v>

2902
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:19.940
<v Speaker 6>moose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Moose,</v>

2903
02:13:19.941 --> 02:13:20.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to fuck you up.</v>

2904
02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Different animals.</v>

2905
02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:24.950
<v Speaker 6>They evolve around grizzly bears all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2906
02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:25.963
<v Speaker 6>So they were up in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain parts of America they </v>

2907
02:13:28.821 --> 02:13:30.770
<v Speaker 6>are too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I ran into one in dental.</v>

2908

<v Speaker 6>Ronald.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.020
<v Speaker 1>can find them in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Wyoming.</v>

2911
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came around the trail.</v>

2912
02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:38.413
<v Speaker 1>We were back country for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and we just came around this </v>

2913
02:13:41.371 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a baby moose,</v>

2914
02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:45.690
<v Speaker 1>like on the middle of the trail are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2915
02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so cute.</v>

2916
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:52.130
<v Speaker 1>It was like he just heard it's mom's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around the year and this.</v>

2917
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this we got out of there really quick.</v>

2918
02:13:54.241 --> 02:13:56.370
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine has a ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia,</v>

2919
02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and he was on his horse and he got too </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the baby.</v>

2920
02:13:59.370 --> 02:14:02.310
<v Speaker 1>So the mother Moose start chasing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>at full clip.</v>

2921
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:03.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking terrifying because the </v>

2922
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Moose is so much bigger than his horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic.</v>

2923
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.173
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on a horse on a horse and he's </v>

2924
02:14:10.681 --> 02:14:11.514
<v Speaker 1>just hoping that the horse can get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this fucking Moose sprinting at </v>

2925
02:14:14.641 --> 02:14:18.930
<v Speaker 1>them and if the most will knock you off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horse and stomp you to death.</v>

2926
02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>She's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:22.683
<v Speaker 1>That is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You catch a mama when she's around her </v>

2928
02:14:24.961 --> 02:14:27.800
<v Speaker 1>babies and she decides you're a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about the out?</v>

2929
02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Does that have a Laker you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that run you down?</v>

2930
02:14:31.471 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's all you and felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened?</v>

2931
02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as aggressive.</v>

2932
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.510
<v Speaker 1>They're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a mean.</v>

2933
02:14:36.511 --> 02:14:38.280

02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Once a year they grow these giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers and they get ready to fight.</v>

2937
02:14:47.250 --> 02:14:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Those antlers are not to fight off </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tent at night and you heard that you'd </v>

2961
02:16:01.221 --> 02:16:02.054
<v Speaker 1>be a little scared to see if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a better one because there's some </v>

<v Speaker 1>hours after you heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spotted him in the distance.</v>

2964
02:16:12.411 --> 02:16:13.244
<v Speaker 1>We spotted him on the hill with </v>
<v Speaker 1>binoculars and then you've got to play </v>

2965
02:16:16.191 --> 02:16:18.110
<v Speaker 1>the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get close to him.</v>

2966
02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:20.540

<v Speaker 1>is blowing.</v>

2967
02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't smell you?</v>

2982
02:17:06.610 --> 02:17:07.443
<v Speaker 6>I saw one that my friend Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a shot in Alaska for NBC in British </v>

2983
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:15.010
<v Speaker 6>Columbia and when it was walking across </v>
<v Speaker 6>the road,</v>

2984
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.450
<v Speaker 6>there was like a dirt road that we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>

2985
02:17:16.451 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 6>We saw walk from one section,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the forest into the neck.</v>

2986
02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:20.403
<v Speaker 6>It looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember that war of the worlds movie </v>

2987
02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:27.290
<v Speaker 6>with Tom Cruise with thing child legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like walking over cars.</v>

2988
02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you eat moose?</v>

2989
02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever hunt for Moose?</v>

2990
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:37.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I shot once.</v>

2991
02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:38.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that at that time,</v>

2992
02:17:38.891 --> 02:17:39.581
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I shot a moose.</v>

2993
02:17:39.581 --> 02:17:40.930
<v Speaker 6>That's Moose right there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>

2994
02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:43.570
<v Speaker 6>A real young Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why it doesn't have much antlers.</v>

2995
02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:47.320
<v Speaker 6>Have a big asset of Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's better to eat?</v>

2996
02:17:47.410 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 6>This is the most redneck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You really can't say it.</v>

2997
02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:51.070
<v Speaker 6>What's better to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Moose is fantastic.</v>

2998
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:54.350
<v Speaker 6>Moose and elk are real similar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Similar is really good to know.</v>

2999
02:17:54.430 --> 02:17:55.263
<v Speaker 6>All wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's healthy and it's prepared </v>

3000
02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:01.960
<v Speaker 6>correctly and taken care of correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got an amazing taste to it.</v>

3001
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:05.830
<v Speaker 6>It's just really like nutrient dense </v>
<v Speaker 6>protein dense,</v>

3002
02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:08.800
<v Speaker 6>very different than any other edits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

3003
02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:09.634
<v Speaker 6>if you want to eat meat in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is the best meat for you and </v>

3004
02:18:13.541 --> 02:18:14.374
<v Speaker 6>the best case scenario because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>not like a factory farmed animal and </v>

3005
02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:19.270
<v Speaker 6>kill it.</v>

3006
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:24.270
<v Speaker 6>It's fate is sealed by mountain lions or</v>
<v Speaker 6>bears or wolves depending on where it is</v>

3007
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.080
<v Speaker 6>or starvation or freezing to death and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it has a very short life.</v>

3008
02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

3009
02:18:30.071 --> 02:18:31.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if,</v>

3010
02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:34.750
<v Speaker 6>if you find a nine year old elk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

3011
02:18:34.751 --> 02:18:36.100
<v Speaker 6>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even possible.</v>

3012
02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:37.373
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fifty percent of them in grizzly bear </v>

3013
02:18:39.191 --> 02:18:40.024
<v Speaker 6>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get killed by bears when they're </v>

3014
02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:43.920
<v Speaker 6>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a high percentage of fonds.</v>

3015
02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:47.050
<v Speaker 6>One out of two fonds get killed deer </v>
<v Speaker 6>fawns too.</v>

3016
02:18:47.051 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of grizzly bear infested </v>
<v Speaker 6>areas.</v>

3017
02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:50.010
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3018
02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:51.213
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried making that elk steak that you </v>

3019
02:18:53.021 --> 02:18:54.760
<v Speaker 6>gave me an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've messed it up.</v>

3020
02:18:54.850 --> 02:18:55.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3021
02:18:55.721 --> 02:18:59.860
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa Cook it very lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to like cook.</v>

3022
02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 6>You should use a meat thermometer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you.</v>

3023
02:19:02.021 --> 02:19:05.020
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did a short amount of time,</v>

3024
02:19:05.021 --> 02:19:06.400
<v Speaker 6>but it was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3025
02:19:06.401 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 6>I think he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3026
02:19:07.730 --> 02:19:08.710
<v Speaker 6>there's some layer that.</v>

3027
02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the silver skin.</v>

3028
02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:11.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fascia.</v>

3029
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:12.250
<v Speaker 6>I didn't take that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3030
02:19:12.251 --> 02:19:14.190
<v Speaker 6>I gave you a wrapped one that was from </v>
<v Speaker 6>the butcher.</v>

3031
02:19:14.210 --> 02:19:15.680
<v Speaker 6>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A roaster steak.</v>

3032
02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:17.770
<v Speaker 6>Like a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember what?</v>

3033
02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.020
<v Speaker 6>See what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a white,</v>

3034
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 6>it's like film that they keep on </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes to sort of retain moisture.</v>

3035
02:19:23.921 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 6>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you see it,</v>

3036
02:19:25.361 --> 02:19:29.120
<v Speaker 6>it's like the Fascia on the outside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>meat and you have to slice that off.</v>

3037
02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:31.220
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like a real visible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3038
02:19:31.221 --> 02:19:34.450
<v Speaker 6>it's really thin and sometimes it's in </v>
<v Speaker 6>between the structure of the milestones,</v>

3039
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:37.350
<v Speaker 6>you've got to find it and cut it out or </v>
<v Speaker 6>eat around it.</v>

3040
02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:40.100
<v Speaker 6>It's just a different kind of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The taste was good.</v>

3041
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:41.230
<v Speaker 6>Was just very.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3042
02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:41.940
<v Speaker 6>chew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chew.</v>

3043
02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:44.050
<v Speaker 6>That's that part you've got to cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all it is.</v>

3044
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Good though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The ground.</v>

3045
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:47.833
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just like for burgers and Chili </v>

3046
02:19:50.151 --> 02:19:51.710
<v Speaker 6>and all kinds of eggs in the morning.</v>

3047
02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fantastic.</v>

3048
02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:54.380
<v Speaker 6>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And again,</v>

3049
02:19:54.381 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to worry about any </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

3050
02:19:55.761 --> 02:19:59.510
<v Speaker 6>It's no hormones by antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the worst part.</v>

3051
02:19:59.511 --> 02:20:00.344
<v Speaker 6>Like it's an animal that lived wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like the idea of just blindly </v>

3052
02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 6>ordering meat like when I'm out because </v>
<v Speaker 6>of not knowing where it came from or not</v>

3053
02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:11.450
<v Speaker 6>knowing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>worse.</v>

3054
02:20:11.451 --> 02:20:13.410
<v Speaker 6>How about knowing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:14.323
<v Speaker 6>Even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you think about like what the animal </v>

3056
02:20:15.801 --> 02:20:16.940
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3057
02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:17.870
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3058
02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:18.893
<v Speaker 6>Suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're in a weird place where we're </v>

3059
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:25.460
<v Speaker 6>jammed into these boxes of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3060
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 6>giant fucking populations and gotta get </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people food and so they want.</v>

3061
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:33.110
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't know where it came from.</v>

3062
02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.210
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3063
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.053
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think about how many people are </v>

3064
02:20:37.491 --> 02:20:40.790
<v Speaker 6>looking for lunch every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3065
02:20:40.791 --> 02:20:45.791
<v Speaker 6>how do you feed this number of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that go to a Pastrami sandwich place?</v>

3066
02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:52.190
<v Speaker 6>Get a fucking big corn beef with Swiss </v>
<v Speaker 6>and mustard and you sitting there with a</v>

3067

<v Speaker 6>friend eating at Jerry's Deli.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have a great time.</v>

3068
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:56.670
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

3069
02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 6>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No thought whatsoever.</v>

3070
02:20:59.601 --> 02:21:01.940
<v Speaker 6>To the whole process of what makes corn </v>
<v Speaker 6>beef.</v>

3071
02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:03.530
<v Speaker 6>How do you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where'd that come from?</v>

3072
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:04.550
<v Speaker 6>Where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:07.520
<v Speaker 6>No thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No thought at all.</v>

3074
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:10.080
<v Speaker 6>It's creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3075
02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 6>fucking weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what do you do?</v>

3076
02:21:12.951 --> 02:21:15.440
<v Speaker 6>There's so many of us do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't do anything,</v>

3077
02:21:15.441 --> 02:21:17.750
<v Speaker 6>like there's no way you can obviously do</v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

3078
02:21:17.751 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying like the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're in right now,</v>

3079
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:21.523
<v Speaker 6>it has to be resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it can't be resolved instantly </v>

3080
02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:29.500
<v Speaker 6>because to try to get all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of ethically raised animals,</v>

3081
02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:31.053
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pasture fed animals that aren't forced </v>

3082
02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 6>to eat some shit they're not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat.</v>

3083
02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:40.790
<v Speaker 6>So they're unhealthy to get your </v>
<v Speaker 6>vegetables all free of pesticides,</v>

3084
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:42.530
<v Speaker 6>but also high yield.</v>

3085
02:21:42.570 --> 02:21:43.403
<v Speaker 6>You protect them from insects and pasts </v>
<v Speaker 6>and bullshit and disease and don't you </v>

3086
02:21:48.921 --> 02:21:51.860
<v Speaker 6>feel like it's going to have to be like </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this new,</v>

3087
02:21:51.861 --> 02:21:54.240
<v Speaker 6>I think it's called better burger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's like a,</v>

3088
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:55.880
<v Speaker 6>a plant based Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3089
02:21:55.890 --> 02:21:58.820
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that almost looks like it's bleeding.</v>

3090
02:21:58.821 --> 02:22:00.230
<v Speaker 6>Like it actually has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3091
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:01.910
<v Speaker 6>have you tried it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't tried it yet,</v>

3092
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:04.670
<v Speaker 6>but people are really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have been talking about it a lot lately.</v>

3093
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.430
<v Speaker 6>Don't confuse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3094
02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:11.690
<v Speaker 6>farm raised plants with not having any </v>
<v Speaker 6>consequences though.</v>

3095
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:12.643
<v Speaker 6>That's another problem that people have </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they look at grain in particular </v>

3096
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:16.783
<v Speaker 6>and they look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of like grain being completely </v>

3097
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:19.424
<v Speaker 6>ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying don't eat grain was </v>

3098
02:22:21.350 --> 02:22:25.320
<v Speaker 6>saying if you look at those gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 6>combines that chew up all that grain,</v>

3099
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 6>when you go over those fields,</v>
<v Speaker 6>after they'd been freshly cut,</v>

3100
02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:30.413
<v Speaker 6>you see vultures all over circling </v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's a ton of fucking things </v>

3101
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:34.944
<v Speaker 6>that got killed and those blades,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rodents and rodents and rabbits and all </v>

3102
02:22:39.421 --> 02:22:40.110
<v Speaker 6>kinds of shit.</v>

3103
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:41.850
<v Speaker 6>Occasionally Fonz,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3104
02:22:41.851 --> 02:22:46.300
<v Speaker 6>if someone fucks up and rick's Fonz </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently will,</v>

3105
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:48.240
<v Speaker 6>when they're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're really young,</v>

3106
02:22:48.241 --> 02:22:49.074
<v Speaker 6>they just stay put.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're scared and they get run over by </v>

3107
02:22:51.061 --> 02:22:51.894
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how are you going to feed 7 billion </v>

3108
02:22:53.551 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 6>people that don't feel like you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the key.</v>

3109
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:59.130
<v Speaker 6>Here's the key man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Preservatives without preservatives,</v>

3110
02:22:59.131 --> 02:23:01.260
<v Speaker 6>like everybody wants everything to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural and organic.</v>

3111
02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:03.360
<v Speaker 6>It's totally true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but without preservatives,</v>

3112
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:04.194
<v Speaker 6>it's very difficult to get supplies of </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit and stockpile things and to have </v>

3113
02:23:07.801 --> 02:23:09.600
<v Speaker 6>things in surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3114
02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:14.010
<v Speaker 6>other than grains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>beans and canned things,</v>

3115
02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:16.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to catch everything,</v>

3116
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:20.670
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of shipping and how we move </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff around,</v>

3117
02:23:20.671 --> 02:23:24.860
<v Speaker 6>how long we want stuff to sit on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>shelves and stuff to stay fresh and want</v>

3118
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:28.260
<v Speaker 6>to avoid mold by putting stuff into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>voids mold.</v>

3119
02:23:28.470 --> 02:23:33.470
<v Speaker 6>It also fucks with the natural gut flora</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we have right in our seat.</v>

3120
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:38.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm like a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're with this repeating shit I read,</v>

3121
02:23:38.281 --> 02:23:43.281
<v Speaker 6>but isn't it crazy how passionate people</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I talked about that I was a eight,</v>

3122
02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:48.510
<v Speaker 6>like a Vegan for a couple of years on my</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast.</v>

3123
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.920
<v Speaker 6>We got more hate comments like people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are so,</v>

3124
02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:57.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3125
02:23:58.190 --> 02:24:01.460
<v Speaker 5>like passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like screw you eating that way.</v>

3126
02:24:01.461 --> 02:24:02.294
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3127
02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:03.153
<v Speaker 5>I always eating that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't saying you have to eat that </v>

3128
02:24:05.121 --> 02:24:09.110
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there is an anger if you</v>

3129
02:24:09.450 --> 02:24:12.420
<v Speaker 6>show them a different way of living or </v>
<v Speaker 6>eating,</v>

3130
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.010
<v Speaker 6>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just eating.</v>

3131
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.903
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they look at you as a person who's </v>

3132
02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:19.050
<v Speaker 6>responsible for the death and suffering </v>
<v Speaker 6>of animals,</v>

3133
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:21.000
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3134
02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:22.920
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3135
02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:23.913
<v Speaker 5>And they wanted to show that they are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a better moral position and they feel </v>

3136
02:24:27.641 --> 02:24:32.170
<v Speaker 5>genuinely outraged by your eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's the other side too.</v>

3137
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:36.370
<v Speaker 5>If you say that you eat like a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mediators come at you and say,</v>

3138
02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:38.050
<v Speaker 5>who the hell do you think you are?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:39.003
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're good bro.</v>

3140
02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:42.310
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been eating dirks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it weird?</v>

3141
02:24:42.490 --> 02:24:43.271
<v Speaker 5>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3142
02:24:43.271 --> 02:24:46.120
<v Speaker 5>well who do you care what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3143
02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:47.523
<v Speaker 5>The mediator ragging on the Vegan to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't make any sense at all unless </v>

3144
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.510
<v Speaker 5>it's just like you ever meet a woman </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is just so mad at men because she's</v>

3145
02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:58.860
<v Speaker 5>ran into a few fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even talk to them.</v>

3146
02:24:59.160 --> 02:24:59.993
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3147
02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:03.330
<v Speaker 5>People just trying to be nice to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You won't let that happen.</v>

3148
02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:04.690
<v Speaker 5>Like every man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His Shit.</v>

3149
02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:06.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of like.</v>

3150
02:25:06.191 --> 02:25:10.210
<v Speaker 5>I feel like maybe some meat eaters that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit on Vegans,</v>

3151
02:25:10.570 --> 02:25:13.600
<v Speaker 5>they get mad because vegans are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing.</v>

3152
02:25:13.601 --> 02:25:17.830
<v Speaker 5>It's such a common thing to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing vegans that mediators like</v>

3153
02:25:17.831 --> 02:25:20.590
<v Speaker 5>almost like attack first first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3154
02:25:20.591 --> 02:25:21.311
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3155
02:25:21.311 --> 02:25:22.144
<v Speaker 5>Like screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to make me feel bad </v>

3156
02:25:22.871 --> 02:25:23.620
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

3157
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3158
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.700
<v Speaker 6>then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a legit thought point that could</v>

3159
02:25:27.701 --> 02:25:32.590
<v Speaker 6>be made that the people that are a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the people maybe that are shitting on</v>

3160
02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:35.440
<v Speaker 6>vegans and veganism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're doing so because they don't want</v>

3161
02:25:35.441 --> 02:25:40.390
<v Speaker 6>to address their own complicity in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>suffering of animals and they don't want</v>

3162
02:25:40.391 --> 02:25:41.920
<v Speaker 6>to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You make me think about it.</v>

3163
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:46.920
<v Speaker 6>I just want to go to Carl's Jr Bacon and</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jalapeno Cheddar thing with.</v>

3164
02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:49.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's that too.</v>

3165
02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:50.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't deny.</v>

3166
02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:51.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's not.</v>

3167
02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:54.010
<v Speaker 6>There's no absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not one or the other.</v>

3168
02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:57.100
<v Speaker 6>It's very possible that there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 6>of shit going on.</v>

3169
02:25:57.190 --> 02:26:02.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that the idea that you could get mad</v>

3170
02:26:02.621 --> 02:26:05.110
<v Speaker 6>at someone for eating Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that seems crazy.</v>

3171
02:26:05.650 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 6>It does increase,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think that people are so connected</v>

3172
02:26:07.931 --> 02:26:11.170
<v Speaker 6>to what they eat that it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It brings up this.</v>

3173
02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:12.850
<v Speaker 6>It's a team thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:13.240
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3175
02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.440
<v Speaker 6>It's like we were talking about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>along the same.</v>

3176
02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.440
<v Speaker 6>How many God damn vegans out there have </v>
<v Speaker 6>the word Vegan and their twitter profile</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3179
02:26:25.241 --> 02:26:29.080
<v Speaker 6>You're wearing it like a badge of honor </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they feel like they're going to help</v>

3180

02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:17.010
<v Speaker 6>world and promoting and I know they </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe that [inaudible].</v>

3197
02:27:17.350 --> 02:27:21.460
<v Speaker 6>I know they believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think we tend to look at.</v>

3198
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.530
<v Speaker 6>She liked the entire thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3199
02:27:23.531 --> 02:27:27.100
<v Speaker 6>We tend to look at the entire group of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people like we have to stop eating meat,</v>

3200
02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:28.600
<v Speaker 6>look at what we're doing to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment.</v>

3201
02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well some of us definitely don't have to</v>

3202
02:27:32.891 --> 02:27:33.724
<v Speaker 6>eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do whatever you want and we </v>

3203
02:27:35.351 --> 02:27:38.080
<v Speaker 6>should all look at factory farming and </v>
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>

3204
02:27:38.081 --> 02:27:42.700
<v Speaker 6>this is despicable and this is horrific </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we've allowed our,</v>

3205
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:45.110
<v Speaker 6>our civilization to accept this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 6>In our inside of our borders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3207
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:47.783
<v Speaker 6>That this is a barbaric practice is </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrifying because it's a complete </v>

3208
02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 6>denial of like the natural order of </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

3209
02:27:56.261 --> 02:27:56.921
<v Speaker 6>Instead you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3210
02:27:56.921 --> 02:28:00.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm might just capture this life a cage </v>
<v Speaker 6>it up and then shoot it when it's ready.</v>

3211
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:01.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh.</v>

3212
02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:05.560
<v Speaker 6>That way it stays tender because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't move like this dark.</v>

3213
02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To me,</v>

3214
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:10.600
<v Speaker 6>what makes sense to me and everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 6>her own thoughts on this,</v>

3215
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.863
<v Speaker 6>it makes sense to me is to just go out </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the wild and get it yourself if you </v>

3216
02:28:16.421 --> 02:28:17.350
<v Speaker 6>can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:28:17.650 --> 02:28:20.230
<v Speaker 6>Everybody can't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know people don't have the time.</v>

3218
02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:21.740
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I that too.</v>

3219
02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3220
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3221
02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling anybody what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>

3222
02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:26.473
<v Speaker 3>I was at a point in 2012 where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to decide if I was going to be a </v>

3223
02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:29.834
<v Speaker 3>Vegan or vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would lean towards vegetarian because </v>

3224
02:28:32.781 --> 02:28:33.614
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with free range eggs and things along </v>

3225
02:28:35.301 --> 02:28:36.134
<v Speaker 3>those lines and I don't think there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything wrong with catching fish </v>

3226
02:28:37.941 --> 02:28:39.680
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe it'd be like a pescatarian,</v>

3227
02:28:40.310 --> 02:28:44.030
<v Speaker 3>but what I wanted to avoid was the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming thing is fucked up.</v>

3228
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:46.430
<v Speaker 3>It is completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I started hunting.</v>

3229
02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be one or the other.</v>

3230
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Once I started hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3231
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:51.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way because this is exciting</v>

3232
02:28:51.351 --> 02:28:52.184
<v Speaker 3>and crazy and wild and it puts you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>tune with nature and this crazy way and </v>

3233
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:55.904
<v Speaker 3>you have this deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense respect for wild things that I </v>

3234
02:28:58.131 --> 02:28:58.760
<v Speaker 3>never had before.</v>

3235
02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.593
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about the management of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife or the resources of the land </v>

3236
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:08.180
<v Speaker 3>that we have public land and that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals roam these areas and these areas</v>

3237
02:29:08.181 --> 02:29:09.014
<v Speaker 3>have to be supported with money and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>money comes from hunting tags and </v>

3238
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:14.250
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On sportsmen,</v>

3239
02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.000
<v Speaker 3>skier and sporting gear and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

3240
02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:19.880
<v Speaker 3>hunting gear related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pay a giant.</v>

3241
02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Some of that money that goes towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>

3242
02:29:22.341 --> 02:29:24.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a big tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like 11 percent.</v>

3243
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:25.363
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like what supports that and </v>

3244
02:29:28.191 --> 02:29:29.024
<v Speaker 3>all the licenses and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>supports the fish and wildlife </v>

3245
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:35.120
<v Speaker 3>management of this country or this wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

3246
02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:36.313
<v Speaker 3>It pretend that's why there's more deer </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country than there has been </v>

3247
02:29:38.571 --> 02:29:41.270
<v Speaker 3>since Columbus landed because more dear </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country.</v>

3248
02:29:41.271 --> 02:29:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Then when Columbus land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not true.</v>

3249
02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:44.293
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is more white tailed deer in this </v>

3250
02:29:45.771 --> 02:29:50.180
<v Speaker 3>country than then there ever was before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's other animals that they</v>

3251
02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:51.014
<v Speaker 3>had almost extirpated because of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are call market killing and market </v>

3252
02:29:55.221 --> 02:29:55.550
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

3253
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:56.383
<v Speaker 3>They used to do at the turn of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>century back when they didn't have </v>

3254
02:29:58.250 --> 02:29:59.083
<v Speaker 3>refrigerators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would and they just took advantage </v>

3255
02:30:01.521 --> 02:30:04.700
<v Speaker 3>of these wild animals roaming around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would hire assassins essentially to</v>

3256
02:30:04.701 --> 02:30:07.210
<v Speaker 3>go shoot these animals and sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell the meat,</v>

3257
02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:10.700
<v Speaker 3>and they almost wiped out all the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They almost wiped out all the deer.</v>

3258
02:30:10.701 --> 02:30:11.534
<v Speaker 3>They almost wiped out everything at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time before fish and wildlife </v>

3259
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:16.970
<v Speaker 3>management company started managing all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

3260
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.540
<v Speaker 3>There was a severe problem with the lack</v>
<v Speaker 3>of wildlife and the,</v>

3261
02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:23.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possible impending instead </v>

3262
02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:26.263
<v Speaker 3>extinction price crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but since then they've repopulated elk </v>

3263
02:30:29.391 --> 02:30:30.224
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They repopulated dear almost everywhere </v>

3264
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:33.523
<v Speaker 3>it was before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big family in New Jersey and </v>

3265
02:30:36.801 --> 02:30:37.634
<v Speaker 3>they're deer all over the place and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>always thought it was because there was </v>

3266
02:30:40.911 --> 02:30:43.520
<v Speaker 3>so much development that the deer have </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere to go.</v>

3267
02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because there's no predators,</v>

3268
02:30:45.370 --> 02:30:46.203
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In New Jersey has more predators now </v>

3269
02:30:47.061 --> 02:30:47.894
<v Speaker 3>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really New Jersey densest </v>

3270
02:30:49.521 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 3>population of black bears in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

3271
02:30:51.770 --> 02:30:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3272
02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:53.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are the predators that control </v>

3273
02:30:54.801 --> 02:30:55.634
<v Speaker 3>the deer population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times that's not enough </v>

3274
02:30:57.951 --> 02:31:00.440
<v Speaker 3>food for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the encroaching population,</v>

3275
02:31:00.441 --> 02:31:01.274
<v Speaker 3>they find out about garbage cans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that and then they become a </v>

3276
02:31:03.651 --> 02:31:05.210
<v Speaker 3>giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3277
02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Because there's also the densest </v>
<v Speaker 3>populated with humans.</v>

3278
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Well it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

3279
02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:10.573
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey has a lot of really rural </v>

3280
02:31:11.841 --> 02:31:13.840
<v Speaker 3>areas that a lot of people aren't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about.</v>

3281
02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:16.670
<v Speaker 3>They're not aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of wildlife in New Jersey.</v>

3282
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>People only think about like Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where</v>

3283
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3284
02:31:21.180 --> 02:31:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think of northern New York,</v>

3285
02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:25.253
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey rather than clerking county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I was born in southern New </v>

3286
02:31:28.470 --> 02:31:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Jersey and then last the whole best </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

3287
02:31:30.731 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3288
02:31:31.890 --> 02:31:33.940
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy rural out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

3289
02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:35.313
<v Speaker 1>my brother in law started to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar to what you started thinking </v>

3290
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:39.414
<v Speaker 1>about how he's going to get us food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and he started hunting deer and </v>

3291
02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>because it's in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these deer,</v>

3292
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:45.864
<v Speaker 1>so he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets to a season and it feeds his </v>

3293
02:31:49.681 --> 02:31:51.090
<v Speaker 1>family for the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3294
02:31:51.450 --> 02:31:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a thought.</v>

3295
02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:54.593
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're controlling a population that </v>

3296
02:31:55.351 --> 02:31:57.420
<v Speaker 1>needs to be controlled because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of accidents.</v>

3297
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>2 million car accidents in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

3298
02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.760
<v Speaker 1>people hitting deer and 150 people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million from hitting deer.</v>

3299
02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this country alone,</v>

3300
02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:07.030
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3301
02:32:07.290 --> 02:32:08.123
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to bring mountain lions </v>

3302
02:32:09.661 --> 02:32:10.494
<v Speaker 1>and wolves everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out a way to control </v>

3303
02:32:11.731 --> 02:32:13.740
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the best ways to control that</v>

3304
02:32:13.741 --> 02:32:18.741
<v Speaker 1>also contributes to wildlife management </v>
<v Speaker 1>funds is hunting rifle hunting tags.</v>

3305
02:32:19.330 --> 02:32:20.163
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all.</v>

3306
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:21.063
<v Speaker 1>It's all very counterintuitive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we assume the people who don't like </v>

3307
02:32:23.371 --> 02:32:24.160
<v Speaker 1>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3308
02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:24.993
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like it if you'd like total </v>

3309
02:32:25.381 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 1>out alone and let it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it,</v>

3310
02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.680
<v Speaker 1>let it live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's life man.</v>

3311
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is we've set up highways</v>

3312
02:32:32.071 --> 02:32:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and these cities and like you can't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave it alone.</v>

3313
02:32:34.531 --> 02:32:35.364
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already interfered in nature to a </v>

3314
02:32:36.711 --> 02:32:40.050
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've altered gigantic swaths of land to</v>

3315
02:32:40.051 --> 02:32:40.884
<v Speaker 1>suit our bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you either want to regress away from </v>

3316
02:32:43.261 --> 02:32:44.094
<v Speaker 1>technological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people that drive tesla saying </v>

3317
02:32:45.991 --> 02:32:47.180
<v Speaker 1>this are the most crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3318
02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:49.013
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3319
02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who want cities and one</v>

3320
02:32:52.891 --> 02:32:53.724
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want management of </v>

3321
02:32:54.361 --> 02:32:55.450
<v Speaker 1>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand it.</v>

3322
02:32:55.451 --> 02:32:57.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't even understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been out there.</v>

3323
02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.880
<v Speaker 1>The city's not even possible unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage wildlife.</v>

3324
02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:00.733
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of mountain lions and bears </v>

3325
02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:05.910
<v Speaker 1>start moving into Pasadena and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people to manage them.</v>

3326
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:08.310
<v Speaker 1>If deers are everywhere and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing into cars,</v>

3327
02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

3328
02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:11.600
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to manage them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>

3329
02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Human shouldn't play God man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3330
02:33:14.450 --> 02:33:17.340
<v Speaker 1>We'll just go outside and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope you don't get eaten,</v>

3331
02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:18.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>per se.</v>

3332
02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I would say a high percentage without </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing anything,</v>

3333
02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:23.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people at hunt.</v>

3334
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Love the outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love being out there.</v>

3335
02:33:26.131 --> 02:33:26.964
<v Speaker 1>But then you have those stories like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying with the Ted nugent where </v>

3336
02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:29.573
<v Speaker 1>people just kinda come in with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns and shoot and get drunk and go off </v>

3337
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.920
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3338
02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Frankie's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't do that.</v>

3339
02:33:35.671 --> 02:33:38.070
<v Speaker 1>But he is a very boisterous right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>type character.</v>

3340
02:33:38.071 --> 02:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing the guys who came in and just</v>

3341
02:33:39.991 --> 02:33:41.860
<v Speaker 1>shot his books and split those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3342
02:33:41.861 --> 02:33:42.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3343
02:33:42.270 --> 02:33:43.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they were drunk or just </v>

3344
02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:45.160
<v Speaker 1>crazy or drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3345
02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:46.980
<v Speaker 1>They were all cracked up and messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3346
02:33:46.981 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 1>They weren't crank around killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathtub crank.</v>

3347
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this,</v>

3348
02:33:51.780 --> 02:33:54.000
<v Speaker 1>this discussion doesn't dissuade you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from going to Musso.</v>

3349
02:33:54.001 --> 02:33:54.834
<v Speaker 1>And frank's gentleman in our sue has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what we've gotta do a Martini and a </v>

3350
02:33:58.651 --> 02:34:00.140
<v Speaker 1>steak once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those,</v>

3351
02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 1>those cows once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3352
02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:03.333
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this meat that I eat last night that I </v>

3353
02:34:04.891 --> 02:34:07.560
<v Speaker 1>shot yesterday morning and ate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

3354
02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:10.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best thing I've ever eaten in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

3355
02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Really fucking picture on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

3356
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:17.860
<v Speaker 1>So rich with nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at those pictures.</v>

3357
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:20.320
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

3358
02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so rich with nutrients.</v>

3359
02:34:23.081 --> 02:34:25.540
<v Speaker 3>So how did you cook that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cooked it on.</v>

3360
02:34:25.541 --> 02:34:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I have a pellet grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a yoder.</v>

3361
02:34:27.810 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a bunch of really good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trager makes it a really good one.</v>

3362
02:34:30.730 --> 02:34:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Green mountain grills makes really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

3363
02:34:32.471 --> 02:34:33.304
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of companies that make them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cook it at 275 degrees until it hits </v>

3364
02:34:37.721 --> 02:34:42.100
<v Speaker 3>an internal temperature of 125 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's not so long,</v>

3365
02:34:42.101 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3366
02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Then I take it off and then I heat up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast iron skillet.</v>

3367
02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:48.190
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried a bunch of different ways,</v>

3368
02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:51.280
<v Speaker 3>but this is the method that works the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best for me that I liked the best.</v>

3369
02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.353
<v Speaker 3>I heat a cast iron skillet very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hot and then I put some grass fed </v>

3370
02:34:56.260 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 3>butter in a cast iron skillet and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>see or the outside of put across.</v>

3371
02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:03.250
<v Speaker 3>So after the internal temperature is </v>
<v Speaker 3>already 125 degrees.</v>

3372
02:35:03.251 --> 02:35:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I cook it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So last in?</v>

3373
02:35:06.020 --> 02:35:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Into the pan which is on the stove top.</v>

3374
02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe less than a minute.</v>

3375
02:35:13.721 --> 02:35:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Each side maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3376
02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:16.654
<v Speaker 3>like maybe like 45 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe each side just to get a little </v>

3377
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:20.674
<v Speaker 3>crust on that and it just is the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of the outside and the </v>

3378
02:35:24.191 --> 02:35:27.310
<v Speaker 3>inside is very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light but warm.</v>

3379
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:29.743
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you take a bite of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just start pounding the table and it </v>

3380
02:35:32.591 --> 02:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>makes you feel physically good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3381
02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:36.363
<v Speaker 3>Not like Ligo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google your big mirror and killed an </v>

3382
02:35:38.001 --> 02:35:39.090
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I mean.</v>

3383
02:35:39.091 --> 02:35:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean like your body responds to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients and the meat in almost like an</v>

3384
02:35:44.081 --> 02:35:44.914
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous way and part of it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the thing that's very different than </v>

3385
02:35:48.191 --> 02:35:49.024
<v Speaker 3>going to Jerry's Deli and getting that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but stromae is that there's an </v>

3386
02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:56.530
<v Speaker 3>incredible deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediate connection with that food,</v>

3387
02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.420
<v Speaker 3>especially for me that day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that I shot that that morning.</v>

3388
02:36:01.810 --> 02:36:03.990
<v Speaker 3>How did you get it done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't have to go to the butcher?</v>

3389
02:36:04.010 --> 02:36:06.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take parts of the body off,</v>

3390
02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:09.550
<v Speaker 3>take the backstraps and the tenderloins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are like,</v>

3391
02:36:09.551 --> 02:36:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm very easy to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuts a butcher shop.</v>

3392
02:36:12.941 --> 02:36:13.774
<v Speaker 3>We'll cut steaks out of the back legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Hams and roasts and things like </v>

3393
02:36:17.621 --> 02:36:18.490
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

3394
02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:19.533
<v Speaker 3>So what did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3395
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:21.120
<v Speaker 3>what was that piece that you had last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night?</v>

3396
02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Was the tenderloin that you just took </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you?</v>

3397
02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:23.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3398
02:36:23.891 --> 02:36:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I took a bunch of it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put it in a cooler,</v>

3399
02:36:26.801 --> 02:36:30.070
<v Speaker 3>a Yeti cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But dude,</v>

3400
02:36:30.071 --> 02:36:31.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3401
02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:35.110
<v Speaker 3>it's the total opposite of going to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>burger place where you just go,</v>

3402
02:36:35.111 --> 02:36:36.280
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I get a double double?</v>

3403
02:36:36.490 --> 02:36:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Onions,</v>

3404
02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:39.730
<v Speaker 3>fries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a large diet coke to please.</v>

3405
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get that and it's great.</v>

3406
02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean it tastes good and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3407
02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:44.890
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no connection,</v>

3408
02:36:44.891 --> 02:36:45.370
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

3409
02:36:45.370 --> 02:36:46.203
<v Speaker 3>Whereas there's no thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane connection and it's really </v>

3410
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:52.360
<v Speaker 3>difficult to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shoot an elk with a bone arrow.</v>

3411
02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.730
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes years and years of practice and</v>

3412
02:36:54.731 --> 02:36:55.564
<v Speaker 3>I still suck at it compared to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good archer and a really good </v>

3413
02:36:58.301 --> 02:37:00.700
<v Speaker 3>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still constantly practicing,</v>

3414
02:37:00.970 --> 02:37:03.380
<v Speaker 3>constantly trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3415
02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:04.870
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean evolve it.</v>

3416
02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Like if I were to get into hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go out there,</v>

3417
02:37:07.661 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to take a gun because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be shooting it in.</v>

3418
02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:14.470
<v Speaker 3>It's even that you have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot a gun properly.</v>

3419
02:37:14.471 --> 02:37:15.440
<v Speaker 3>The snotty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

3420
02:37:15.470 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 3>People think it's easy</v>

3421
02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 6>to go shoot an animal with a gun getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>close to one.</v>

3422
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:20.510
<v Speaker 6>If you don't know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing,</v>

3423
02:37:20.511 --> 02:37:25.040
<v Speaker 6>you could look out and wander into a </v>
<v Speaker 6>deer is not paying attention to them,</v>

3424
02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:26.990
<v Speaker 6>but most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3425
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.380
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time you have to get within </v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of hundred yards of them.</v>

3426
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:32.360
<v Speaker 6>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the wind is wrong,</v>

3427
02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:35.570
<v Speaker 6>they smell you a mile away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fucking bolt immediately.</v>

3428
02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.153
<v Speaker 6>We stink doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We smelled terrible when animals smell </v>

3429
02:37:40.401 --> 02:37:41.420
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3430
02:37:41.490 --> 02:37:42.323
<v Speaker 6>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would wish science could figure out </v>

3431
02:37:44.361 --> 02:37:48.950
<v Speaker 6>what it is that hits an animal's </v>
<v Speaker 6>nostrils when they smell a person,</v>

3432
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:50.720
<v Speaker 6>but like a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

3433
02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:52.820
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're gone.</v>

3434
02:37:52.850 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3435
02:37:53.390 --> 02:37:57.020
<v Speaker 6>The wind hits the back of your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if your winds change.</v>

3436
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:58.023
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like say if you're looking at these </v>

3437
02:37:58.731 --> 02:37:59.564
<v Speaker 6>animals and you're trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 6>stock on one and then the wind is </v>

3438
02:38:02.751 --> 02:38:04.940
<v Speaker 6>blowing in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is perfect.</v>

3439
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:07.070
<v Speaker 6>They can't smell me because the wind's </v>
<v Speaker 6>in my face.</v>

3440
02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 6>Then as you get closer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the wind can shift.</v>

3441
02:38:10.250 --> 02:38:13.580
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes the wind swirls and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the back of your neck and they just.</v>

3442
02:38:13.581 --> 02:38:16.060
<v Speaker 6>The animals perk up and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck right.</v>

3443
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:17.300
<v Speaker 6>And they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3444
02:38:17.301 --> 02:38:18.134
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because they're thinking about </v>

3445
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:22.100
<v Speaker 6>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what they're thinking about.</v>

3446
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:26.420
<v Speaker 6>They're thinking about smelling a cat </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that fucking that sent hits them.</v>

3447
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:28.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This weird human scent.</v>

3448
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:31.010
<v Speaker 6>The human things bad too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we probably smell.</v>

3449
02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:33.590
<v Speaker 6>We'd probably have our own unique danger</v>
<v Speaker 6>smell,</v>

3450
02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.030
<v Speaker 6>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3451
02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.210
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the evolution is not to avoid humans.</v>

3452
02:38:38.211 --> 02:38:39.770
<v Speaker 6>We've only been here a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

3453
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:43.310
<v Speaker 6>The evolution of the ELC is most likely </v>
<v Speaker 6>to avoid predators.</v>

3454
02:38:43.311 --> 02:38:47.390
<v Speaker 6>Cats and bears that smell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They smell a predator.</v>

3455
02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:48.800
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck this,</v>

3456
02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:52.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to the breath of a grizzly bear.</v>

3457
02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:53.613
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the lane hits you if you're a </v>

3458
02:38:57.231 --> 02:38:58.880
<v Speaker 6>fucking dear Jesus.</v>

3459
02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:01.820
<v Speaker 6>I saw coyote the other day out on my </v>
<v Speaker 6>neighbor's lawn.</v>

3460
02:39:01.821 --> 02:39:06.180
<v Speaker 6>It was like a Husky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a big ass look like a wolf.</v>

3461
02:39:06.181 --> 02:39:08.540
<v Speaker 6>It's probably a Coi Wolf on the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>half.</v>

3462
02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:09.590
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are happening.</v>

3463
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:12.290
<v Speaker 6>There's coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3464
02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:13.153
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a guy named Dan Flores that I </v>

3465
02:39:14.721 --> 02:39:15.554
<v Speaker 6>had on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wrote this book called Coyote </v>

3466
02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:18.253
<v Speaker 6>America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fascinating book with a history of </v>

3467
02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:19.980
<v Speaker 6>coyotes in America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3468
02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:21.800
<v Speaker 6>Can absorb that book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so good.</v>

3469
02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:23.660
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing because it's so crazy.</v>

3470
02:39:23.661 --> 02:39:25.310
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's all the shit that I did know.</v>

3471
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:27.530
<v Speaker 6>One of the things is that a coyote is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>wolf.</v>

3472
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:31.070
<v Speaker 6>It is a small wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a small species of walking.</v>

3473
02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:34.970
<v Speaker 6>That's why they interbreed with walls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>

3474
02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:36.373
<v Speaker 6>Every wolf except the gray wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gray wolf left America for so long </v>

3475
02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:40.993
<v Speaker 6>and went to Africa and became like </v>
<v Speaker 6>jackals and all these different dog </v>

3476
02:39:44.811 --> 02:39:47.060
<v Speaker 6>species over there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but all the dogs that we have,</v>

3477
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:48.560
<v Speaker 6>all of them came from wolves.</v>

3478
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:50.720
<v Speaker 6>All of them and all of our dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dogs,</v>

3479
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:53.150
<v Speaker 6>every dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they all can breed with a wolf.</v>

3480
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:54.620
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of them.</v>

3481
02:39:54.730 --> 02:39:55.461
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

3482
02:39:55.461 --> 02:39:58.530
<v Speaker 6>And the coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they breed with different,</v>

3483
02:39:58.531 --> 02:40:00.890
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what percentage?</v>

3484
02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:02.210
<v Speaker 6>Grey Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What percentage?</v>

3485
02:40:02.211 --> 02:40:03.920
<v Speaker 6>Red Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's separate species.</v>

3486
02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.730
<v Speaker 6>They're all the same thing genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like every dog,</v>

3487
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:10.070
<v Speaker 6>when they traced the DNA of a dog that </v>
<v Speaker 6>give,</v>

3488
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:12.390
<v Speaker 6>give all of them come from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Real.</v>

3489
02:40:12.391 --> 02:40:14.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of my little black lab.</v>

3490
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:16.110
<v Speaker 6>The Coi Wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3491
02:40:16.111 --> 02:40:18.540
<v Speaker 6>You're a little black lab at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3492
02:40:18.541 --> 02:40:23.541
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what that process was a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So these coils,</v>

3493
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:26.530
<v Speaker 6>you see the one in the black,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the Coi Wolf,</v>

3494
02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.760
<v Speaker 6>but it's like a combination of like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>wolf and a coyote that play.</v>

3495
02:40:31.831 --> 02:40:33.870
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even coyotes though,</v>

3496
02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:36.630
<v Speaker 6>this Guy Dan Flores,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're saying are kind of wolf.</v>

3497
02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:37.553
<v Speaker 6>That's why it works in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they don't like if something </v>

3498
02:40:40.501 --> 02:40:43.560
<v Speaker 6>like a Tiger Fox align and they make a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lagger,</v>

3499
02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:44.693
<v Speaker 6>that lagger can have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but because they're two totally </v>

3500
02:40:47.461 --> 02:40:48.294
<v Speaker 6>different species,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at tiger can fuck a lion and get it </v>

3501
02:40:50.821 --> 02:40:51.654
<v Speaker 6>pregnant.</v>

3502
02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:53.220
<v Speaker 6>There's a real legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about it.</v>

3503
02:40:53.221 --> 02:40:58.221
<v Speaker 6>Talk to you worried.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was not the woods for you.</v>

3504
02:40:58.590 --> 02:41:00.240
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wouldn't go out of here,</v>

3505
02:41:00.241 --> 02:41:01.074
<v Speaker 6>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me get you back home to your </v>

3506

3509
02:41:11.250 --> 02:41:14.850

<v Speaker 6>So what you've seen is larger coyote.</v>

3510
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:17.400
<v Speaker 6>This was a big coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was big.</v>

3511
02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:18.650
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>

3512
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:23.970
<v Speaker 6>He might just be a regular coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's big to a lot of food out here,</v>

3513
02:41:23.971 --> 02:41:24.804
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

3514
02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:27.780

3516
02:41:29.421 --> 02:41:30.254

3517
02:41:31.771 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 6>opposed to those people in New Jersey </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are dealing with bears.</v>

3518
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:35.393
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People.</v>

<v Speaker 6>People that live outside like go,</v>

3520
02:41:38.610 --> 02:41:41.010
<v Speaker 6>go to that video from far rockaway where</v>
<v Speaker 6>these two,</v>

3521
02:41:41.011 --> 02:41:43.410
<v Speaker 6>500 pound bear,</v>

3522
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:47.910
<v Speaker 6>500 pound bears are rustling and </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting in the street,</v>

3523
02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.840
<v Speaker 6>knocking over mailboxes in New Jersey </v>
<v Speaker 6>and cars stopped there.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Look at the size of these fuckers and </v>

3530
02:42:08.611 --> 02:42:11.550
<v Speaker 6>they're fighting over territory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't attack people though.</v>

02:42:11.610 --> 02:42:12.930
<v Speaker 6>Sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do.</v>

<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

3534
02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:21.740
<v Speaker 6>A kid in Alaska was killed by a bear who</v>
<v Speaker 6>was on look them go to their big.</v>

3535
02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.820
<v Speaker 6>A kid in Alaska was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was on a,</v>

<v Speaker 6>My friend Cam lives in Oregon and one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guys in his neighborhood died </v>

3602
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:22.423
<v Speaker 6>because someone in front of him hit a </v>
<v Speaker 6>deer and the deer went flying through </v>

3603
02:45:25.581 --> 02:45:28.370
<v Speaker 6>the air and his car was behind it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the deer landed through his</v>

3604
02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:30.580
<v Speaker 5>windshield.</v>

<v Speaker 5>continue destroying the world with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid fucking car,</v>

3609
02:45:42.771 --> 02:45:44.960
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3610
02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:46.770
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there shouldn't be any wildlife</v>

3611
02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:50.560
<v Speaker 6>because they didn't convince you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about it's their land man?</v>

3612
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:54.730
<v Speaker 6>How about if there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well then you shouldn't be talking to me</v>

3613
02:45:54.731 --> 02:45:57.670
<v Speaker 6>because there'd be no computers and </v>
<v Speaker 6>their land.</v>

3614
02:45:57.671 --> 02:46:01.660
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't survive either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We carve off swaths of it for our own.</v>

3615
02:46:01.661 --> 02:46:03.370
<v Speaker 6>What we decide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cities or our nomad,</v>

3616
02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:04.373
<v Speaker 6>the cities aren't even real man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is something we build over their </v>

3617
02:46:07.150 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 6>sacred burial ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is where the bears just</v>

3618
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 5>buried a young man talk to each other in</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ancient language.</v>

3619
02:46:14.031 --> 02:46:17.190
<v Speaker 5>You don't understand anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We cannot look.</v>

3620
02:46:17.370 --> 02:46:19.460
<v Speaker 5>We all have our own little fantasy world</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

3621
02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:22.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the anthropomorphization that thing that</v>

3622
02:46:22.341 --> 02:46:23.174
<v Speaker 5>Disney movies did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they made animals talk that fuck </v>

3623
02:46:25.231 --> 02:46:27.710
<v Speaker 5>people up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really did fuck this up as children.</v>

3624
02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really did.</v>

3625
02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:30.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3626
02:46:30.161 --> 02:46:31.310
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3627
02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:33.230
<v Speaker 5>people think that's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm joking around.</v>

3628
02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:34.273
<v Speaker 5>I'm being dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched my kids are vegetarians </v>

3629
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:37.663
<v Speaker 5>because my wife is was a big part of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was seeing them as people like seeing </v>

3630
02:46:45.171 --> 02:46:46.760
<v Speaker 5>them with a little bow tie or like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3631
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:48.440
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really has an effect.</v>

3632
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're a little baby,</v>

3633
02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.353
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you grow up watching Yogi bear </v>

3634
02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:55.880
<v Speaker 5>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3635
02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:59.370
<v Speaker 5>foghorn Leghorn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as a child,</v>

3636
02:46:59.450 --> 02:47:01.950
<v Speaker 5>when I was watching that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mom was awesome.</v>

3637
02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:06.920
<v Speaker 5>Making amazing meals at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did not connect it.</v>

3638
02:47:06.921 --> 02:47:10.730
<v Speaker 5>Now yogi was Yogi and mom just made </v>
<v Speaker 5>lasagna.</v>

3639
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:13.550
<v Speaker 5>There's a real problem with representing</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

3640
02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:14.451
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3641
02:47:14.451 --> 02:47:16.130
<v Speaker 5>it's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3642
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:21.080
<v Speaker 5>For us as an adult child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it puts the idea in your head that these</v>

3643
02:47:21.081 --> 02:47:22.970
<v Speaker 5>things are something other than what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are.</v>

3644
02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3645
02:47:24.111 --> 02:47:26.420
<v Speaker 5>not that there's anything bad with what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>

3646
02:47:26.421 --> 02:47:28.550
<v Speaker 5>what they are is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even predators,</v>

3647
02:47:28.551 --> 02:47:30.740
<v Speaker 5>like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't want predators wiped out.</v>

3648
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:33.920
<v Speaker 5>I think bears and wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking awesome man.</v>

3649
02:47:33.921 --> 02:47:36.780
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy to see too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh no one around them.</v>

3650
02:47:37.010 --> 02:47:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look,</v>

3651
02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:38.713
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why the factory farming thing is </v>

3652
02:47:40.071 --> 02:47:42.790
<v Speaker 5>so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a consciousness to animals.</v>

3653
02:47:43.430 --> 02:47:44.810
<v Speaker 5>My Dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3654
02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has a sensitivity and a love.</v>

3655
02:47:48.090 --> 02:47:51.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is you make those animals suffer.</v>

3656
02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:52.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly.</v>

3657
02:47:53.050 --> 02:47:56.480
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing is that animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially dogs,</v>

3658
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:57.343
<v Speaker 5>they have developed this intense </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitivity in connection with people </v>

3659
02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:03.860
<v Speaker 5>over thousands and thousands of years of</v>
<v Speaker 5>having this weird symbiotic relationship</v>

3660
02:48:03.861 --> 02:48:05.360
<v Speaker 5>with us to the point where you get like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3661
02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:08.210
<v Speaker 5>like I have a golden golden retriever </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

3662
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:10.340
<v Speaker 5>This is the sweetest dog I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 5>in my life.</v>

3663
02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.440
<v Speaker 5>It was a big old snuggle bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3664
02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:13.303
<v Speaker 5>he's a baby and he's the sweetest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like occasionally he plays all little </v>

3665
02:48:16.761 --> 02:48:21.761
<v Speaker 5>too rough and everybody gets mad at him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's such a sweet love bucket.</v>

3666
02:48:22.430 --> 02:48:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Like when I come home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dog,</v>

3667
02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:24.913
<v Speaker 5>he runs around me in circles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then drops onto his back and I start </v>

3668
02:48:27.711 --> 02:48:29.120
<v Speaker 5>rubbing his belly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3669
02:48:29.121 --> 02:48:32.810
<v Speaker 5>I sit down and he climbs on top of me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and circles around and kisses my face,</v>

3670
02:48:32.811 --> 02:48:35.960
<v Speaker 5>licking like crazy with his legs up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the air.</v>

3671
02:48:35.970 --> 02:48:36.680
<v Speaker 5>He wants to be a rub.</v>

3672
02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:38.450
<v Speaker 5>His Tummy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the past.</v>

3673
02:48:38.451 --> 02:48:40.220
<v Speaker 5>It's the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's so sweet.</v>

3674
02:48:40.221 --> 02:48:40.941
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did a,</v>

3675
02:48:40.941 --> 02:48:42.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was an article the other day,</v>

3676
02:48:42.231 --> 02:48:45.350
<v Speaker 5>which I didn't get too deep into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that they,</v>

3677
02:48:45.351 --> 02:48:46.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

3678
02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:49.640
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>train dogs,</v>

3679
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:52.700
<v Speaker 5>so they would be calm enough so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could put them in an MRI.</v>

3680
02:48:52.701 --> 02:48:54.920
<v Speaker 5>You could actually study their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

3681
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:58.220
<v Speaker 5>It was hard to do because dogs like </v>
<v Speaker 5>freak out and that,</v>

3682
02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:00.500
<v Speaker 5>but you need them just to stay still </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a human.</v>

3683
02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:01.633
<v Speaker 5>So you can study their brain and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>learned that a lot of the patterns of a </v>

3684
02:49:06.021 --> 02:49:11.021
<v Speaker 5>dog's brain are similar to ours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Empathy and feeling for things in motion</v>

3685
02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:12.340
<v Speaker 5>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3686
02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:14.093
<v Speaker 5>it was so similar that it really showed </v>
<v Speaker 5>like just genetically wired to feel an </v>

3687
02:49:20.310 --> 02:49:23.070
<v Speaker 5>and have emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very similar to the way we do.</v>

3688
02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:24.480
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what else?</v>

3689
02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:26.940
<v Speaker 6>So genetically wired to do kill </v>
<v Speaker 6>chickens.</v>

3690
02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.340
<v Speaker 6>Real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3691
02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:32.430
<v Speaker 6>Do you have chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he's killed one,</v>

3692
02:49:32.431 --> 02:49:35.400
<v Speaker 6>but he definitely brought a dead one to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me once when I was like,</v>

3693
02:49:35.401 --> 02:49:37.860
<v Speaker 6>did you kill this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck happened?</v>

3694
02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:40.110
<v Speaker 6>Because it didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>

3695
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.983
<v Speaker 6>Because he doesn't seem that aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the chickens before it might've </v>

3696
02:49:44.031 --> 02:49:45.780
<v Speaker 6>died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they just die sometimes.</v>

3697
02:49:45.781 --> 02:49:46.860
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just die.</v>

3698
02:49:46.861 --> 02:49:48.420
<v Speaker 6>You find them in their pen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3699
02:49:48.450 --> 02:49:50.250
<v Speaker 6>The chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have this big ass,</v>

3700
02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:51.473
<v Speaker 6>like a chicken house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you just find them in their </v>

3701
02:49:52.861 --> 02:49:53.950
<v Speaker 6>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3702
02:49:54.290 --> 02:49:55.830
<v Speaker 6>You know there's where you get all your </v>
<v Speaker 6>eggs.</v>

3703
02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:56.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's great.</v>

3704
02:49:56.761 --> 02:49:57.930
<v Speaker 6>They don't live that long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3705
02:49:57.970 --> 02:49:59.670
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he fucking,</v>

3706
02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:03.300
<v Speaker 6>now that he's had one in his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has carried it around,</v>

3707
02:50:03.610 --> 02:50:04.443
<v Speaker 6>found it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now he wants to go near them all the </v>

3708
02:50:05.761 --> 02:50:06.301
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3709
02:50:06.301 --> 02:50:08.430
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cut the shit.</v>

3710
02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:11.160
<v Speaker 6>Can you train them out to sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3711
02:50:11.161 --> 02:50:12.510
<v Speaker 6>But you got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be on it all the time.</v>

3712
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:14.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got to be like a daily thing.</v>

3713
02:50:14.101 --> 02:50:16.880
<v Speaker 6>Like he really likes chasing chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3714
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:17.880
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you talking about?</v>

3715
02:50:17.881 --> 02:50:18.410
<v Speaker 6>These are fucking</v>

3716
02:50:18.410 --> 02:50:19.890
<v Speaker 5>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3717
02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:25.110
<v Speaker 5>these are back here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had this thing since it was a big chase.</v>

3718
02:50:25.170 --> 02:50:29.100
<v Speaker 5>Chickens in their system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's instinct of course.</v>

3719
02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:29.991
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

3720
02:50:29.991 --> 02:50:31.730
<v Speaker 5>He's so happy too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you catch them doing it,</v>

3721
02:50:31.731 --> 02:50:32.564
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just doesn't want to listen to my </v>

3722
02:50:36.621 --> 02:50:38.960
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's great black lab.</v>

3723
02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:41.210
<v Speaker 5>She's so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing.</v>

3724
02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:43.300
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we,</v>

3725
02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:44.233
<v Speaker 5>it's a vegetarian household,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was only when I don't make meat that </v>

3726
02:50:48.261 --> 02:50:50.270
<v Speaker 5>often when I'm with the family because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just kind of,</v>

3727
02:50:50.330 --> 02:50:51.163
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of weird to be sitting there </v>

3728
02:50:51.651 --> 02:50:53.600
<v Speaker 5>eating meat in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3729
02:50:53.601 --> 02:50:55.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I do,</v>

3730
02:50:55.850 --> 02:51:00.620
<v Speaker 5>when we're alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they're giving her some meat.</v>

3731
02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:01.933
<v Speaker 5>She started to see me as the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the house that gave me whatever that </v>

3732
02:51:04.971 --> 02:51:05.804
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our relationship went to a whole nother </v>

3733
02:51:08.121 --> 02:51:08.954
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3734
02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:10.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3735
02:51:10.641 --> 02:51:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Now she looks at me differently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meet with butter on it.</v>

3736
02:51:15.380 --> 02:51:18.950
<v Speaker 5>They don't even bother chewing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen when you give them onto so</v>

3737
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:21.070
<v Speaker 5>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so gone.</v>

3738
02:51:21.071 --> 02:51:23.180
<v Speaker 5>So I really feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3739
02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:26.000
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you give them dog food,</v>

3740
02:51:26.001 --> 02:51:28.350
<v Speaker 5>they never react like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Lee does.</v>

3741
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:32.560
<v Speaker 5>You're calling it chicken was chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

3742
02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:35.870
<v Speaker 5>I cut off a couple of peaks at ELC and </v>
<v Speaker 5>put it in my dogs food.</v>

3743
02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:41.020
<v Speaker 5>They're looking for more of time on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bowl.</v>

3744
02:51:41.361 --> 02:51:43.230
<v Speaker 5>Under the bold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'd be gone.</v>

3745
02:51:43.400 --> 02:51:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Take your time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good instincts.</v>

3746
02:51:47.770 --> 02:51:48.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's us.</v>

3747
02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.390
<v Speaker 6>It is a weird thing that we've created </v>
<v Speaker 6>these animals.</v>

3748
02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:55.020
<v Speaker 6>Not created them but sort of bred them </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the point where they become a part of</v>

3749
02:51:55.021 --> 02:51:57.930
<v Speaker 6>the household and they live with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't speak English.</v>

3750
02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:00.020
<v Speaker 6>No rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know the rules.</v>

3751
02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:01.500
<v Speaker 6>I've been kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't</v>

3752
02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:04.750
<v Speaker 5>when your dog sometimes like it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>like your face to face.</v>

3753
02:52:04.751 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 5>He was looking you in the face</v>

3754
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:06.843
<v Speaker 6>and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you just see the teeth and you're </v>

3755
02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:09.373
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is kind of weird that I my face as </v>

3756
02:52:11.471 --> 02:52:12.304
<v Speaker 6>close to this draw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank God this thing is really nice </v>

3757
02:52:15.251 --> 02:52:17.320
<v Speaker 6>because it could just bite me in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>face right now.</v>

3758
02:52:17.350 --> 02:52:18.183
<v Speaker 6>That's why radic dogs like Cujo are so </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking terrifying because they're a </v>

3759
02:52:21.071 --> 02:52:21.904
<v Speaker 6>part of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then all of a sudden something goes </v>

3760
02:52:23.231 --> 02:52:25.720
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a job when I was a kid that we got</v>

3761
02:52:25.721 --> 02:52:26.554
<v Speaker 6>from the pound and had this temper and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we had them for a couple of days and it </v>

3762
02:52:29.291 --> 02:52:31.270
<v Speaker 6>just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It kept getting worse and worse.</v>

3763
02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:33.760
<v Speaker 6>It was a Doberman Doberman Pinch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

3764
02:52:33.761 --> 02:52:37.260
<v Speaker 6>And it got to the point where was </v>
<v Speaker 6>growling and barking at us in the house.</v>

3765
02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:39.700
<v Speaker 6>Scared of everybody and grabbing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>barking.</v>

3766
02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:40.593
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where we were talking to it like what's </v>

3767
02:52:41.741 --> 02:52:42.850
<v Speaker 6>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's wrong?</v>

3768
02:52:45.090 --> 02:52:47.620
<v Speaker 6>And then we brought it to the vet and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>

3769
02:52:47.621 --> 02:52:49.980
<v Speaker 6>this dog's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really got this temporary.</v>

3770
02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:54.100
<v Speaker 6>It was just like a chemical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's some sort of a disease they can get</v>

3771
02:52:54.101 --> 02:52:58.420
<v Speaker 6>from other dogs and a lot of times dogs </v>
<v Speaker 6>that didn't have their shots,</v>

3772
02:52:58.690 --> 02:52:59.523
<v Speaker 6>they get it and it can make some dogs </v>
<v Speaker 6>behave very erratically and you can't </v>

3773
02:53:03.671 --> 02:53:07.060
<v Speaker 6>correct that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they can.</v>

3774
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:10.870
<v Speaker 6>At least they couldn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a dog canine distemper,</v>

3775
02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:11.913
<v Speaker 6>contagious and serious viral illness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No known cure disease affects dogs and </v>

3776
02:53:17.081 --> 02:53:19.000
<v Speaker 6>certain species of wildlife such as </v>
<v Speaker 6>raccoons,</v>

02:53:21.521 --> 02:53:23.680

<v Speaker 6>viral.</v>

3780
02:53:23.681 --> 02:53:25.540
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was in your house?</v>

<v Speaker 6>but for this one dog,</v>

3783

<v Speaker 6>but he had something that gave him </v>

3789
02:53:48.730 --> 02:53:51.040
<v Speaker 6>seizures and they thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>distemper.</v>

3790
02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:53.170
<v Speaker 6>See fish seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>paralysis,</v>

3791
02:53:53.410 --> 02:53:57.130
<v Speaker 6>and attacks of hysteria seed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was what my dog had.</v>

3792
02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:59.560
<v Speaker 6>He had the hysteria part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3793
02:53:59.561 --> 02:54:01.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he was lethargic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was just sitting there,</v>

3794
02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:04.450
<v Speaker 6>even though he's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like it was trying to get us,</v>

3795
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.943
<v Speaker 6>but he wasn't doing that may result in </v>
<v Speaker 6>two to five weeks after the initial </v>

3796
02:54:09.311 --> 02:54:11.680
<v Speaker 6>infection that said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>You have three.</v>

3798
02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:14.973
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's mean to have one dog </v>

3799
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:21.590
<v Speaker 6>doesn't mean if you're around the dog </v>
<v Speaker 6>and hanging out with him every time.</v>

3800
02:54:21.870 --> 02:54:24.130
<v Speaker 6>It gets a lot of love dogs like dogs </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

3801
02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:26.630
<v Speaker 6>They do like dogs are pack animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3802
02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:27.610
<v Speaker 6>they have a good time together.</v>

3803
02:54:27.670 --> 02:54:28.503
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had this little thing came over to </v>

3804
02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:34.660
<v Speaker 6>the house that was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My daughter's got a Chihuahua and so the</v>

3805
02:54:34.661 --> 02:54:35.494
<v Speaker 6>Chihuahua and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the golden get together and they run </v>

3806
02:54:38.891 --> 02:54:42.430
<v Speaker 6>around and play and it's like they have </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking best time,</v>

3807
02:54:42.431 --> 02:54:47.431
<v Speaker 6>like it's a part and I could go for </v>
<v Speaker 6>hours running around circles,</v>

3808
02:54:47.651 --> 02:54:49.550
<v Speaker 6>barking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3809
02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.190
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3810
02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:54.010
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot of work having.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

3811
02:54:54.011 --> 02:54:56.020
<v Speaker 6>one's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when I saw them together,</v>

3812
02:54:56.021 --> 02:54:59.620
<v Speaker 6>I had a little weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like especially if it's a good size yard</v>

3813
02:54:59.710 --> 02:55:01.230
<v Speaker 6>where the around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3814
02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:02.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an okay.</v>

3815
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:03.383
<v Speaker 6>So the crazy thing is that that used to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a wolf even like an English bulldog </v>

3816
02:55:07.130 --> 02:55:09.950
<v Speaker 6>somewhere along the line that was a wolf</v>
<v Speaker 6>was a wolf.</v>

3817
02:55:10.010 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 6>They all come from that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3818
02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:15.340
<v Speaker 6>And then the wolves like slowly got </v>
<v Speaker 6>closer to us by the campfire.</v>

3819
02:55:15.350 --> 02:55:16.760
<v Speaker 6>We had food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we chuck a little food.</v>

3820
02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:18.710
<v Speaker 6>He'd be cool to ask the other worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So back off.</v>

3821
02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:19.640
<v Speaker 6>These guys go through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're cool,</v>

3822
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:20.930
<v Speaker 6>they're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're cool man.</v>

3823
02:55:21.430 --> 02:55:23.000
<v Speaker 6>Then they became more and more </v>
<v Speaker 6>submissive.</v>

3824
02:55:23.001 --> 02:55:23.834
<v Speaker 6>They think over time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one that were more submissive or more </v>

3825
02:55:26.421 --> 02:55:27.254
<v Speaker 6>accepted and they bred more and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>their ears started a flop more </v>

3826
02:55:30.471 --> 02:55:34.310
<v Speaker 6>submissive versus like the ears up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like listening around for prey.</v>

3827
02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:35.373
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instead they became this thing came to </v>

3828
02:55:38.781 --> 02:55:40.760
<v Speaker 6>know his dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty great.</v>

3829
02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:44.720
<v Speaker 6>Fucking strange man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Strange know that when they were.</v>

3830
02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:48.290
<v Speaker 6>Before they started doing those DNA </v>
<v Speaker 6>tests on dogs,</v>

3831
02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:51.860
<v Speaker 6>they thought that they would find that </v>
<v Speaker 6>dogs came from like a bunch of different</v>

3832
02:55:51.861 --> 02:55:54.500
<v Speaker 6>wild canids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a bunch of different wild dogs.</v>

3833
02:55:54.990 --> 02:55:56.580
<v Speaker 6>That's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3834
02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.390
<v Speaker 6>From North America to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there's so different looking.</v>

3835
02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:02.480
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy heat map.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3836
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:03.410
<v Speaker 6>so our people though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3837
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:05.930
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the weird thing about life</v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

3838
02:56:05.931 --> 02:56:06.764
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the reasons why it's so </v>

3839
02:56:08.331 --> 02:56:09.164
<v Speaker 6>easy for us to like gather up into these</v>
<v Speaker 6>stupid tribes because visually we look </v>

3840
02:56:13.111 --> 02:56:14.280
<v Speaker 6>so much different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3841
02:56:14.490 --> 02:56:15.323
<v Speaker 6>I mean people from South Korea look way </v>
<v Speaker 6>different than people from Africa and </v>

3842
02:56:17.961 --> 02:56:20.990
<v Speaker 6>it's very different to not think of us </v>
<v Speaker 6>all as the same.</v>

3843
02:56:21.050 --> 02:56:22.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you try bill up,</v>

3844
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:23.423
<v Speaker 6>but the people that look similar to you </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you're scared of the other and </v>

3845
02:56:25.641 --> 02:56:28.820
<v Speaker 6>not even the look.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's probably like within us,</v>

3846
02:56:28.821 --> 02:56:32.080
<v Speaker 6>there's traits that you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're recognizing.</v>

3847
02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:32.914
<v Speaker 6>Like when I'm around the Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's something about it that's </v>

3848
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:38.320
<v Speaker 6>comforting for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3849
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:41.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's like really funny.</v>

3850
02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:42.913
<v Speaker 6>Not Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's really odd when like super </v>

3851
02:56:44.721 --> 02:56:49.721
<v Speaker 6>light skinned black people are like </v>
<v Speaker 6>really radical black activists,</v>

3852
02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:50.241
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3853
02:56:50.241 --> 02:56:55.100
<v Speaker 6>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you making that for something here?</v>

3854
02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:55.933
<v Speaker 6>Like what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just how you actually feel or you </v>

3855
02:56:58.671 --> 02:57:01.130
<v Speaker 6>like really want to gain acceptance in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

3856
02:57:01.131 --> 02:57:04.580
<v Speaker 6>Try Super Hardcore tribes with knocking </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

3857
02:57:05.060 --> 02:57:06.890
<v Speaker 6>You have to like show your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

3858
02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:07.753
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because this one thing that a friend of </v>

3859
02:57:08.781 --> 02:57:13.670
<v Speaker 6>mine said WHO's black who was talking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about a black racism and he was like one</v>

3860
02:57:13.671 --> 02:57:14.504
<v Speaker 6>of the weirdest racisms that I've had to</v>
<v Speaker 6>accept his dark people versus a like a </v>

3861
02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:21.093
<v Speaker 6>lighter black skin light skinned light </v>
<v Speaker 6>skinned people will often times be </v>

3862
02:57:25.011 --> 02:57:27.620
<v Speaker 6>really racist to dark skin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>black people.</v>

3863
02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:28.790
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

3864
02:57:28.791 --> 02:57:29.624
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

3865
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:30.950
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3866
02:57:30.951 --> 02:57:31.784
<v Speaker 6>there's a big difference difference </v>
<v Speaker 6>between how light skinned black people </v>

3867
02:57:35.961 --> 02:57:39.080
<v Speaker 6>feel about dark skin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>black people and vice versa.</v>

3868
02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:43.220
<v Speaker 6>And dark skinned black people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>racism within black people.</v>

3869
02:57:43.221 --> 02:57:44.090
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

3870
02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:47.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a whole mindset that uh,</v>

3871
02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:49.160
<v Speaker 6>was trying to understand.</v>

3872
02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:49.993
<v Speaker 6>Just give people enough time and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually find a group to belong to </v>

3873
02:57:53.570 --> 02:57:55.310
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They even inside the group,</v>

3874
02:57:55.550 --> 02:57:58.400
<v Speaker 6>like if you ask like the black people </v>
<v Speaker 6>who are light skin,</v>

3875
02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:01.530
<v Speaker 6>do they identify more with the dark </v>
<v Speaker 6>skinned black people or white people?</v>

3876
02:58:01.531 --> 02:58:03.150
<v Speaker 6>They'd probably see more of the dark </v>
<v Speaker 6>skinned black people.</v>

3877
02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:04.800
<v Speaker 6>This is obviously a great </v>
<v Speaker 6>generalization,</v>

3878
02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:06.960
<v Speaker 6>but these people that have these issues </v>
<v Speaker 6>with this thing,</v>

3879
02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:10.770
<v Speaker 6>but they probably in comparison to white</v>
<v Speaker 6>people like,</v>

3880
02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:13.660
<v Speaker 6>well I'm not that person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm one of these and more like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this guy's not like me because you </v>

<v Speaker 6>faction,</v>

3885
02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:30.610
<v Speaker 6>hard line Republicans versus a more on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the libertarian side outright.</v>

3886
02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:32.810
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 6>idea,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's the extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's saying that that my team can never </v>

3900

<v Speaker 6>My Quad is so good.</v>

3908
02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:26.330
<v Speaker 6>That Sargon of a guy was trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

3909
02:59:26.430 --> 02:59:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Tell me it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was spelling.</v>

3910
02:59:28.170 --> 02:59:30.390
<v Speaker 6>Spelling it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not taught that.</v>

3911
02:59:30.391 --> 02:59:33.810
<v Speaker 6>It's that [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's out of his mind twice.</v>

3912
02:59:33.900 --> 02:59:34.830
<v Speaker 6>How do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Swat?</v>

3913
02:59:35.010 --> 02:59:35.843
<v Speaker 6>Swat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Team,</v>

3914
02:59:35.960 --> 02:59:37.620
<v Speaker 6>Swat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say you don't say Swat.</v>

3915
02:59:37.621 --> 02:59:41.100
<v Speaker 6>You fucking Cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have any.</v>

3916
02:59:41.730 --> 02:59:42.563
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of English people telling us </v>

3917
02:59:44.490 --> 02:59:47.860
<v Speaker 6>how to use their language is offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is really rude.</v>

3918
02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:51.480
<v Speaker 6>Can't tell me how to speak your </v>
<v Speaker 6>language,</v>

3919
02:59:51.690 --> 02:59:56.690
<v Speaker 6>English person back off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We own it now.</v>

3920
02:59:57.120 --> 02:59:57.953
<v Speaker 6>My favorite variation of English though </v>
<v Speaker 6>is Australian because it's a very </v>

3921
03:00:00.451 --> 03:00:03.390
<v Speaker 6>distinctive version of ink.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not American,</v>

3922
03:00:03.860 --> 03:00:06.200
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No distinctive completely.</v>

3923
03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:08.940
<v Speaker 6>They're off in their own island to </v>
<v Speaker 6>making up their own rules.</v>

3924
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:11.190
<v Speaker 6>Like my friend Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my friend Adam Green tree,</v>

3925
03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:12.053

<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

3927
03:00:16.830 --> 03:00:20.250
<v Speaker 6>He's been living by himself in the back </v>
<v Speaker 6>country.</v>

3928
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:22.800
<v Speaker 6>Bowhunting in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was there for like 20 days.</v>

3930
03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:27.990
<v Speaker 6>I started watching because I heard you </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk to him.</v>

3931
03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:33.000
<v Speaker 6>He bailed on Colorado and now he's moved</v>
<v Speaker 6>into the grizzly infested mountains of.</v>

3932
03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:35.790
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only that,</v>

3933
03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:37.620
<v Speaker 6>the grizzly invested mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Montana,</v>

3934
03:00:37.621 --> 03:00:38.454

<v Speaker 6>he documented officially documented </v>

3935
03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:42.953
<v Speaker 6>grizzly bears in Colorado where people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are saying there's no grizzlies in </v>

3936
03:00:45.481 --> 03:00:46.314
<v Speaker 6>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's even a website deals with </v>

3937
03:00:47.761 --> 03:00:48.451
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It says,</v>

3938
03:00:48.451 --> 03:00:51.720
<v Speaker 6>the people who say they cited a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 6>bear in Colorado,</v>

3939
03:00:51.721 --> 03:00:54.270
<v Speaker 6>it's oftentimes like Sasquatch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you think you saw.</v>

3940
03:00:54.510 --> 03:00:55.343
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He is an experienced outdoorsmen who's </v>

3941
03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:58.673
<v Speaker 6>been a bowhunter his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He knows what he's looking at and he </v>

3942
03:01:01.151 --> 03:01:01.984
<v Speaker 6>found several grizzly bears in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountains deep in the background and </v>

3943
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:06.790
<v Speaker 6>recorded it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sixteen miles in.</v>

3944
03:01:06.791 --> 03:01:07.624
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean a little blobs moving around the </v>

3945
03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:09.493
<v Speaker 6>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hard to see.</v>

3946
03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:10.713
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're big and he said that is </v>

3947
03:01:12.791 --> 03:01:15.940
<v Speaker 6>absolutely 100 percent a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountain grizzly bear.</v>

3948
03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:18.820
<v Speaker 6>So they're moving into Colorado to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been in the woods a long time,</v>

3949
03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:21.110
<v Speaker 6>20 days and now he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got in a car.</v>

3950
03:01:21.111 --> 03:01:26.111
<v Speaker 6>I rented a car to come a day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He drove into a think Wyoming or Idaho.</v>

3951
03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:31.300
<v Speaker 6>Whatever's connected to Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's Wyoming.</v>

3952
03:01:31.390 --> 03:01:32.260
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Idaho.</v>

3953
03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:33.123
<v Speaker 6>Think it's Tido.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3954
03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:33.993
<v Speaker 6>He drove into Idaho and now he's making </v>
<v Speaker 6>his way down from Idaho into the parks </v>

3955
03:01:38.141 --> 03:01:42.730
<v Speaker 6>in Idaho and he's hiking into Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 6>into grizzly infested back in Wyoming.</v>

3956
03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Coming from the south.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking scary shit man.</v>

3957
03:01:46.061 --> 03:01:47.770
<v Speaker 6>There's grizzlies everywhere up there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3958
03:01:47.771 --> 03:01:49.030
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has a family.</v>

3959
03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:50.133
<v Speaker 6>Yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's just out in the woods to be </v>

3960
03:01:51.911 --> 03:01:54.150
<v Speaker 6>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not scared.</v>

3961
03:01:54.190 --> 03:01:55.023
<v Speaker 6>I'm what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm envious of how he gets out of his </v>

3962
03:01:57.041 --> 03:01:59.590
<v Speaker 6>house to go to the woods for 20 days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 days.</v>

3963
03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:03.550
<v Speaker 6>My wife would let me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3964
03:02:03.551 --> 03:02:04.680
<v Speaker 6>if you were already,</v>
<v Speaker 6>love it.</v>

3965
03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:07.090
<v Speaker 6>If you're updating your instagram story </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly.</v>

3966
03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:08.013
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my theory as to why he's doing </v>

3967
03:02:08.711 --> 03:02:09.460
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This way.</v>

3968
03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:11.530
<v Speaker 6>He lets everybody know where he is all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

3969
03:02:11.950 --> 03:02:12.783
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Versus like him just disappearing off </v>

3970
03:02:14.861 --> 03:02:16.320
<v Speaker 6>the map for 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3971
03:02:16.540 --> 03:02:17.373
<v Speaker 6>It is so interesting that you could be </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there and be able to film stuff and </v>

3972
03:02:20.411 --> 03:02:23.140
<v Speaker 6>communicate and look at maps and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>savage.</v>

3973
03:02:23.170 --> 03:02:26.380
<v Speaker 6>Not a lot of people can do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even most bowhunters will tell you,</v>

3974
03:02:26.381 --> 03:02:27.130
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3975
03:02:27.130 --> 03:02:27.963
<v Speaker 6>I'll go for a back country camping trip </v>
<v Speaker 6>for like seven days by myself for 10 </v>

3976
03:02:31.961 --> 03:02:34.060
<v Speaker 6>days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this guy is just gone so deep.</v>

3977
03:02:34.061 --> 03:02:36.310
<v Speaker 6>He's in by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by himself.</v>

3978
03:02:36.340 --> 03:02:37.450
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing.</v>

3979
03:02:37.451 --> 03:02:40.240
<v Speaker 6>I mean even even one other friend makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>a big difference.</v>

3980
03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:41.193
<v Speaker 6>He ran out of food while back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you could see him like getting </v>

3981
03:02:42.641 --> 03:02:43.600
<v Speaker 6>skinnier and skinnier.</v>

3982
03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:44.433
<v Speaker 6>As time went on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had to go into town and get more </v>

3983
03:02:45.971 --> 03:02:47.140
<v Speaker 6>food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

3984
03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:50.390
<v Speaker 6>and ran out of food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see it in his face,</v>

3985
03:02:50.391 --> 03:02:51.224
<v Speaker 6>like his face is getting more gaunt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His eyes are getting more sunken in and </v>

3986
03:02:53.311 --> 03:02:54.010
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3987
03:02:54.010 --> 03:02:55.270
<v Speaker 6>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like exhausted.</v>

3988
03:02:55.271 --> 03:02:57.220
<v Speaker 6>At one point he was just like laying </v>
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>

3989
03:02:57.280 --> 03:02:59.380
<v Speaker 6>So deep man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean what he's doing,</v>

3990
03:02:59.381 --> 03:03:03.010
<v Speaker 6>he had a filter water through a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a wet.</v>

3991
03:03:03.180 --> 03:03:06.190

<v Speaker 5>American [inaudible],</v>

4034
03:04:52.580 --> 03:04:54.920
<v Speaker 5>but Australia and slightly cooler than </v>
<v Speaker 5>English.</v>

03:04:55.490 --> 03:05:00.490
<v Speaker 5>That's the most to learn English </v>
<v Speaker 5>language sounds a little,</v>

03:05:00.531 --> 03:05:03.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sends a little reckless to me.</v>

4041
03:05:15.971 --> 03:05:16.804
<v Speaker 5>surrounded by sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all out there on their own to </v>

4042
03:05:19.570 --> 03:05:21.800
<v Speaker 5>tax them because no one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one is going to help.</v>

4043
03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:22.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4044
03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:26.150
<v Speaker 5>how big is the Australian army?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 25 people I think.</v>

4045
03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:28.520
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole place is only as the amount of</v>

4046
03:05:28.521 --> 03:05:31.400
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same size as America,</v>

4047
03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:33.650
<v Speaker 5>but the amount of people is the same as </v>
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

4048
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:35.000
<v Speaker 5>Slightly less than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4049
03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:37.280
<v Speaker 5>that sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just drive around.</v>

4050
03:05:37.310 --> 03:05:42.310
<v Speaker 5>I was just saying this before to Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I think living in La,</v>

4051
03:05:43.580 --> 03:05:47.600
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like I'm going to end up the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cranky guy that can't be around people.</v>

4052
03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:51.020
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many people around us all the</v>

4053
03:05:51.021 --> 03:05:52.000
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4054
03:05:52.340 --> 03:05:54.380
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's exhausting.</v>

4055
03:05:54.740 --> 03:05:56.450
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also energizing,</v>

4056
03:05:56.480 --> 03:05:57.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhat.</v>

4057
03:05:58.060 --> 03:06:01.250
<v Speaker 5>When I come back from the woods might go</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere like.</v>

4058
03:06:01.310 --> 03:06:02.990
<v Speaker 5>Especially camping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4059
03:06:03.220 --> 03:06:04.053
<v Speaker 5>And then you come back to civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You kind of appreciate restaurants and </v>

4060
03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:09.620
<v Speaker 5>movie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4061
03:06:09.650 --> 03:06:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Get some popcorn and watch a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like being around it.</v>

4062
03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just need breaks from it.</v>

4063
03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:15.530
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4064
03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:17.900
<v Speaker 5>I think the best of both worlds is both </v>
<v Speaker 5>worlds,</v>

4065
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.823
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

03:08:02.430 --> 03:08:06.540
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many people got all this food shipped</v>

4108
03:08:06.541 --> 03:08:11.541
<v Speaker 5>into these cities and Madison factory </v>
<v Speaker 5>farming and medicine are living longer,</v>

4109
03:08:12.690 --> 03:08:15.650
<v Speaker 5>living much longer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>longer,</v>

4110
03:08:15.690 --> 03:08:16.523
<v Speaker 5>so many people during the last eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the stat that blew my mind </v>

4111
03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:24.750
<v Speaker 5>during the last time we had an eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>total eclipse like that on our,</v>

4112
03:08:24.751 --> 03:08:26.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on our continent.</v>

4113
03:08:26.980 --> 03:08:29.640
<v Speaker 5>It was 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 years ago.</v>

4114
03:08:30.060 --> 03:08:30.893
<v Speaker 5>There were fewer people in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>state of California than who live in La </v>

4115
03:08:34.141 --> 03:08:34.974
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

4116
03:08:35.790 --> 03:08:37.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it must be nice.</v>

4117
03:08:37.290 --> 03:08:37.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>must have been.</v>

4118
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:41.130
<v Speaker 5>Gloria gets to the comedy store in like </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 minutes on a bike.</v>

4119
03:08:42.090 --> 03:08:46.190
<v Speaker 5>It was rolled out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sweet.</v>

4120
03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:49.020
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a small town.</v>

4121
03:08:49.050 --> 03:08:51.630
<v Speaker 5>So many damn people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen 17.</v>

4122
03:08:51.631 --> 03:08:56.430
<v Speaker 5>There's 3 million people in California </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the whole state.</v>

4123
03:08:56.730 --> 03:08:57.563
<v Speaker 5>That's way less than la million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three people and they were probably </v>

4124
03:09:04.410 --> 03:09:07.360
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many fucking people gross.</v>

4125
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I can't go to town one more time running</v>
<v Speaker 5>into those asshole.</v>

4126
03:09:11.671 --> 03:09:12.900
<v Speaker 5>What is today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Texas?</v>

4127
03:09:12.901 --> 03:09:15.810
<v Speaker 5>What does Texas have today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to the very end here.</v>

4128
03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Texas has 27 million Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire country of Canada.</v>

4129
03:09:20.130 --> 03:09:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Thirty 6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

4130
03:09:22.141 --> 03:09:22.974
<v Speaker 5>I'll fornia $39 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So California has more people than </v>

4131
03:09:25.141 --> 03:09:27.060
<v Speaker 5>fucking Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not going crazy.</v>

4132
03:09:27.061 --> 03:09:29.760
<v Speaker 5>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4133
03:09:29.820 --> 03:09:33.090
<v Speaker 5>Well that's also one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 5>California or the Canada,</v>

4134
03:09:33.150 --> 03:09:34.140
<v Speaker 5>the people are so nice.</v>

4135
03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:36.810
<v Speaker 5>They're not as overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4136
03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:37.733
<v Speaker 5>They're surprised to see you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that bear on the fucking California </v>

4137
03:09:41.101 --> 03:09:41.621
<v Speaker 5>signed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4138
03:09:41.621 --> 03:09:42.454
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That bears that are extinct in </v>

4139
03:09:45.211 --> 03:09:46.680
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

4140
03:09:46.681 --> 03:09:47.514
<v Speaker 5>That's a grizzly grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to have grizzlies in </v>

4141
03:09:48.721 --> 03:09:49.830
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

4142
03:09:49.831 --> 03:09:54.831
<v Speaker 5>the last grizzly that killed a man in </v>
<v Speaker 5>California before they killed him was in</v>

4143
03:09:55.001 --> 03:09:57.550
<v Speaker 5>Lubbock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back California.</v>

4144
03:09:57.610 --> 03:10:01.570
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy that was the last guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed by a bear in California.</v>

4145
03:10:01.571 --> 03:10:02.404
<v Speaker 5>His name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Stephen Labeck something </v>

4146
03:10:04.450 --> 03:10:05.560
<v Speaker 5>l e b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>e c,</v>

4147
03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.903
<v Speaker 5>and they named the town after him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the last guy in California to be </v>

4148
03:10:09.611 --> 03:10:14.080
<v Speaker 5>killed by bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to have huge bears in the 1800.</v>

4149
03:10:14.081 --> 03:10:16.570
<v Speaker 5>Think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was then the 18 hundreds,</v>

4150
03:10:16.571 --> 03:10:18.880
<v Speaker 5>but they killed them because they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing all the people,</v>

4151
03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.790
<v Speaker 5>like they were killing us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was us or them,</v>

4152
03:10:21.791 --> 03:10:24.340
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile it's damn we put on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flag like we won,</v>

4153
03:10:24.341 --> 03:10:26.560
<v Speaker 5>but we miss you buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so puts you on the flag.</v>

4154
03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:27.460
<v Speaker 5>We love you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We will.</v>

4155
03:10:27.461 --> 03:10:29.700
<v Speaker 5>We love looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you've got to stop eating us.</v>

4156
03:10:29.701 --> 03:10:31.430
<v Speaker 5>And so we had to shoot you all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

4157
03:10:31.450 --> 03:10:32.283
<v Speaker 5>It's lame about that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's similar to what happened with the </v>

4158
03:10:35.591 --> 03:10:38.760
<v Speaker 5>native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not think it is.</v>

4159
03:10:38.890 --> 03:10:41.800
<v Speaker 5>You know what most we killed most of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>native Americans in this country.</v>

4160
03:10:42.130 --> 03:10:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smallpox,</v>

4161
03:10:43.540 --> 03:10:46.060
<v Speaker 5>like a bunch of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we present that?</v>

4162
03:10:46.061 --> 03:10:47.050
<v Speaker 5>We brought to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4163
03:10:47.100 --> 03:10:49.000
<v Speaker 5>That crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety percent of them were killed.</v>

4164
03:10:49.001 --> 03:10:50.650
<v Speaker 5>Wiped out by disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4165
03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:51.820
<v Speaker 5>I was taught.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We killed them all.</v>

4166
03:10:52.180 --> 03:10:54.130
<v Speaker 5>We killed a lot of them for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not We.</v>

4167
03:10:54.131 --> 03:10:54.964
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just reading the grandchild of </v>

4168
03:10:56.501 --> 03:10:57.190
<v Speaker 5>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4169
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:59.740
<v Speaker 5>I was just reading exactly what we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Italy at the time,</v>

4170
03:10:59.741 --> 03:11:02.260
<v Speaker 5>enjoying ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lake.</v>

4171
03:11:02.290 --> 03:11:03.123
<v Speaker 5>The Tinaya Lake in a yosemite is named </v>
<v Speaker 5>after this chief Tinaya who we killed </v>

4172
03:11:10.511 --> 03:11:11.650
<v Speaker 5>his son.</v>

4173
03:11:12.430 --> 03:11:16.110
<v Speaker 5>We killed his son in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should stop saying way.</v>

4174
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:19.270
<v Speaker 5>I know it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel guilty.</v>

4175
03:11:19.271 --> 03:11:21.490
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had that in my act for a while.</v>

4176
03:11:21.491 --> 03:11:22.780
<v Speaker 5>My daughter was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did we do that?</v>

4177
03:11:22.781 --> 03:11:23.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>easy with the.</v>

4178
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:24.583
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were on vespas and eating spaghetti </v>

4179
03:11:27.161 --> 03:11:32.161
<v Speaker 5>were lovers a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then named the lake after him killed</v>

4180
03:11:33.521 --> 03:11:35.590
<v Speaker 5>his kid in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made him suffer,</v>

4181
03:11:35.610 --> 03:11:37.840
<v Speaker 5>killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then named the lake after him.</v>

4182
03:11:37.841 --> 03:11:38.674
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it absolves us of the guilt and we're </v>

4183
03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:43.930
<v Speaker 5>just step out tonight or there was some </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible,</v>

4184
03:11:43.931 --> 03:11:47.050
<v Speaker 5>horrible shit going on back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horrible all over the world.</v>

4185
03:11:47.051 --> 03:11:48.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even before that,</v>

4186
03:11:48.281 --> 03:11:49.114
<v Speaker 5>like the accounts of what Columbus did </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they encountered the natives and </v>

4187
03:11:52.030 --> 03:11:52.570
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4188
03:11:52.570 --> 03:11:55.060
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to get gold out these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and slaughtered these people.</v>

4189
03:11:55.061 --> 03:11:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Slaughtered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4190
03:11:56.560 --> 03:11:57.970
<v Speaker 5>just serial killer type shit.</v>

4191
03:11:58.890 --> 03:12:00.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

4192
03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:02.200
<v Speaker 5>We used to have Columbus to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess we still do,</v>

4193
03:12:02.330 --> 03:12:03.970
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not in California.</v>

4194
03:12:03.971 --> 03:12:06.340
<v Speaker 5>They're getting rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They voted it apple debt.</v>

4195
03:12:06.390 --> 03:12:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good idea.</v>

4196
03:12:07.570 --> 03:12:08.970
<v Speaker 5>But in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4197
03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:09.833
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus circle and they still have the </v>

4198
03:12:11.220 --> 03:12:14.530
<v Speaker 5>somewhat deface the Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a statue in central park.</v>

4199
03:12:14.531 --> 03:12:17.470
<v Speaker 5>The other day I stopped doing that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like you gotta stop,</v>

4200
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:18.423
<v Speaker 5>you can't deface gingiss con statue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing to revere and worship </v>

4201
03:12:22.661 --> 03:12:24.580
<v Speaker 5>these people and we definitely shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that anymore.</v>

4202
03:12:24.820 --> 03:12:28.540
<v Speaker 5>But like to those statues are history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should look at it but understand what</v>

4203
03:12:28.541 --> 03:12:29.374
<v Speaker 5>we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we're not worshiping the statue of </v>

4204
03:12:31.991 --> 03:12:32.824
<v Speaker 5>Christopher Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it is a fascinating thing to know </v>

4205
03:12:34.301 --> 03:12:37.900
<v Speaker 5>that this monster got in a boat and sail</v>
<v Speaker 5>across the ocean.</v>

4206
03:12:37.901 --> 03:12:38.734
<v Speaker 5>If it wasn't for him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>likely wouldn't be a whole population </v>

4207
03:12:40.961 --> 03:12:41.794
<v Speaker 5>here and the people that he went with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you've got to add some new </v>

4208
03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:45.213
<v Speaker 5>statues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>statues of other people that had a </v>

4209
03:12:49.180 --> 03:12:50.960
<v Speaker 5>positive impact on stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

4210
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:52.160
<v Speaker 5>You know what's fucked up though about</v>

4211
03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:52.993
<v Speaker 6>a lot of these civil war statues that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are wanting to tear down now and </v>

4212
03:12:55.821 --> 03:12:59.330
<v Speaker 6>destroying it's fucked up was when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>look at when those things were built,</v>

4213
03:12:59.690 --> 03:13:00.523
<v Speaker 6>those things weren't built like way </v>
<v Speaker 6>before the civil rights movement and </v>

4214
03:13:03.231 --> 03:13:04.064
<v Speaker 6>there are a relic of an ancient past.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them were built in response to </v>

4215
03:13:08.151 --> 03:13:11.300
<v Speaker 6>the civil rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they really are racist and origin.</v>

4216
03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:12.193
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the Robert e Dot Lee ones and </v>

4217
03:13:13.281 --> 03:13:18.140
<v Speaker 6>all that shit where the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>south going to rise again and yeah.</v>

4218
03:13:18.141 --> 03:13:18.974
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they weren't around since the 18 </v>

4219
03:13:20.361 --> 03:13:21.194
<v Speaker 6>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like 65 and line from a made </v>

4220
03:13:24.351 --> 03:13:25.184
<v Speaker 6>really quickly and shittily in response </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the civil rights movement and that </v>

4221
03:13:28.551 --> 03:13:29.384
<v Speaker 6>they were made out of copper and bronze </v>
<v Speaker 6>and shit cause it was easier to do than </v>

4222
03:13:32.031 --> 03:13:33.170
<v Speaker 6>stone.</v>

4225
03:13:35.810 --> 03:13:36.643
<v Speaker 6>Now we had to create some other people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a visualization of the number of </v>

4226
03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:44.870
<v Speaker 6>monuments that were erected and what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 6>war monuments.</v>

4230
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:54.080
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It was a retaliation summer race riots,</v>

4233
03:13:57.590 --> 03:14:01.460
<v Speaker 6>giant spike and civil war monuments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tulsa race riots.</v>

4234
03:14:01.490 --> 03:14:04.520
<v Speaker 6>Giant spike in civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Civil war statues.</v>

4235
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:05.720

<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4236
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:07.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you could track it.</v>

4237
03:14:08.610 --> 03:14:10.460
<v Speaker 6>A bigger version of this too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to find right now,</v>

4238
03:14:10.461 --> 03:14:13.250
<v Speaker 6>but we got this little chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's spooky.</v>

4239
03:14:13.340 --> 03:14:15.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because no one's talking about that when</v>

4240
03:14:15.381 --> 03:14:16.214
<v Speaker 6>they're talking about keeping these </v>
<v Speaker 6>things up and they represent our </v>

4241
03:14:17.931 --> 03:14:19.280
<v Speaker 6>heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like yeah,</v>

4242
03:14:19.281 --> 03:14:20.114
<v Speaker 6>I understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but worshiping this is a real problem </v>

4243
03:14:23.781 --> 03:14:24.614
<v Speaker 6>because you got to realize what was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>motivation to put like why is it okay </v>

4244
03:14:27.561 --> 03:14:28.394
<v Speaker 6>though for me?</v>

4245
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:29.331
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

4246
03:14:29.331 --> 03:14:30.164
<v Speaker 6>Why do I look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a problem with this because they </v>

4247
03:14:32.241 --> 03:14:33.074
<v Speaker 6>did it during the racist 19 sixties or </v>
<v Speaker 6>during the early 19 hundreds and the </v>

4248
03:14:36.530 --> 03:14:37.363
<v Speaker 6>naacp was created.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would accept it better if it was 200 </v>

4249
03:14:40.551 --> 03:14:42.410
<v Speaker 6>years old instead of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what's wrong with.</v>

4250
03:14:42.450 --> 03:14:43.970
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like why do I care?</v>

4251
03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:45.710
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>

4252
03:14:45.711 --> 03:14:46.431
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4253
03:14:46.431 --> 03:14:48.650
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is it like,</v>

4254
03:14:48.930 --> 03:14:49.763
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why is it more offensive that it was </v>

4255
03:14:51.501 --> 03:14:52.334
<v Speaker 6>created by racists in the 19 sixties </v>
<v Speaker 6>than if it was created by racist 200 </v>

4256
03:14:55.521 --> 03:14:57.010
<v Speaker 6>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's because,</v>

4257
03:14:57.011 --> 03:14:59.930
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>direct line people alive right now.</v>

4258
03:14:59.940 --> 03:15:01.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

4259
03:15:02.660 --> 03:15:03.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's dirty.</v>

4260
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:05.810
<v Speaker 6>It's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you look at the actual spikes.</v>

4261
03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>George Wallace.</v>

4262
03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:12.780
<v Speaker 6>It jumped up during the assassination of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Martin Luther King Jr.</v>

4263
03:15:12.780 --> 03:15:13.613
<v Speaker 6>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When George Wallace was blocking the </v>

4264
03:15:14.130 --> 03:15:17.480
<v Speaker 6>school's jumped up a whole bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's Weird.</v>

4265
03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:18.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4266
03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:19.730
<v Speaker 6>Detroit race riots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

4267
03:15:19.731 --> 03:15:24.020
<v Speaker 6>We got a little spike hanGing onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not so fast.</v>

4268
03:15:24.050 --> 03:15:25.650
<v Speaker 6>Teams at war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4269
03:15:26.450 --> 03:15:28.790
<v Speaker 6>Act of kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not an act of kindness.</v>

4270
03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:31.850
<v Speaker 6>That's putting a statue up there out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of love.</v>

4271
03:15:32.210 --> 03:15:33.043
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever think though that those </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that Were doing all this stuff </v>

4272
03:15:36.021 --> 03:15:36.854
<v Speaker 6>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they really didn't have a direct </v>

4273
03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:39.373
<v Speaker 6>connection with the world the way we </v>
<v Speaker 6>have today and then one of the reasons </v>

4274
03:15:41.871 --> 03:15:44.810
<v Speaker 6>why we're seeing all these people </v>
<v Speaker 6>tearing these things down now is because</v>

4275
03:15:44.811 --> 03:15:47.450
<v Speaker 6>we all have a direct connection with </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and we realized that,</v>

4276
03:15:47.451 --> 03:15:49.100
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these civil war,</v>

4277
03:15:49.770 --> 03:15:52.110
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the civil war was,</v>

4278
03:15:52.111 --> 03:15:52.944
<v Speaker 6>was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like saying that it's a part of your </v>

4279
03:15:54.271 --> 03:15:55.440
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is horse shit.</v>

4280
03:15:55.441 --> 03:15:55.771
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4281
03:15:55.771 --> 03:15:56.604
<v Speaker 6>this is a part of a terrible attempted </v>
<v Speaker 6>genocide on black people did demonizing </v>

4282
03:16:01.381 --> 03:16:06.381
<v Speaker 6>to the point where they were the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it was okay to enslave them hundreds</v>

4283
03:16:06.780 --> 03:16:06.870
<v Speaker 6>of years.</v>

4284
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:07.703
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could live in in New York state and </v>

4285
03:16:09.571 --> 03:16:12.060
<v Speaker 4>not have any idea really what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on</v>

4286
03:16:12.170 --> 03:16:13.490
<v Speaker 6>the south at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4287
03:16:13.491 --> 03:16:14.061
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4288
03:16:14.061 --> 03:16:17.130
<v Speaker 6>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The civil war was about economics.</v>

4289
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:20.840
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that argument too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've seen an argument torn apart.</v>

4290
03:16:20.910 --> 03:16:21.743
<v Speaker 4>If there was social media back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think slavery would have even </v>

4291
03:16:24.510 --> 03:16:25.330
<v Speaker 4>existed?</v>

4292
03:16:25.330 --> 03:16:26.290
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and here's the thing.</v>

4293
03:16:26.350 --> 03:16:27.670
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants slavery today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do,</v>

4294
03:16:27.671 --> 03:16:28.504
<v Speaker 6>you're a cunt too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that when you guys </v>

4295
03:16:31.811 --> 03:16:32.644
<v Speaker 6>define yourself by a war that you lost </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the war had a big part of what the </v>

4296
03:16:37.061 --> 03:16:38.230
<v Speaker 6>war was about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Slavery.</v>

4297
03:16:38.410 --> 03:16:41.950
<v Speaker 6>That's a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a big giant problem.</v>

4298
03:16:41.951 --> 03:16:42.784
<v Speaker 6>And how the world looks at us and looks </v>
<v Speaker 6>at you and the way you look at yourself </v>

4299
03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:48.430
<v Speaker 6>like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4300
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:49.383
<v Speaker 6>you're justifying some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>horrific shit in human history so far </v>

4301
03:16:53.711 --> 03:16:55.220
<v Speaker 6>from american history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4302
03:16:55.540 --> 03:16:57.340
<v Speaker 6>That's not out of kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Slavery.</v>

4303
03:16:57.350 --> 03:17:00.240
<v Speaker 6>They actually live better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That argument.</v>

4304
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:02.470
<v Speaker 6>Better slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh gee,</v>

4305
03:17:02.471 --> 03:17:03.304

<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't how strange is it that people </v>

4306
03:17:04.991 --> 03:17:05.824
<v Speaker 6>live better when you fed them and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>lived in fucking cages then when they </v>

4307
03:17:09.251 --> 03:17:10.084
<v Speaker 6>were released with no skills and no </v>
<v Speaker 6>education and couldn't read and how to </v>

4308
03:17:12.671 --> 03:17:13.504
<v Speaker 6>repopulate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm like in a country that they </v>

4309
03:17:14.771 --> 03:17:15.604
<v Speaker 6>don't even.</v>

4310
03:17:15.900 --> 03:17:16.733
<v Speaker 6>It's not even a country of their origin </v>
<v Speaker 6>as you're still putting up a statue on </v>

4311
03:17:19.571 --> 03:17:20.404
<v Speaker 6>your way out the door of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>general who fought to keep slavery </v>

4312

<v Speaker 6>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's move on.</v>

4313
03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:28.420
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that the south is an </v>
<v Speaker 6>awesome folks.</v>

4314
03:17:28.421 --> 03:17:30.710
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that you're not awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4315

4325
03:17:57.860 --> 03:18:01.340
<v Speaker 4>there is a danger in wiping out history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we don't learn from it.</v>

4326
03:18:01.341 --> 03:18:02.174

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
