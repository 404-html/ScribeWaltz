32
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.943
<v Speaker 1>I've gone,</v>

33
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.510

<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

37
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I went to this clothing store and I used to beat really in a big girl.</v>

38
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like very big girls.</v>

39
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>How big,</v>

40
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>as big as you could muster.</v>

42
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.253
<v Speaker 1>Hundred plus.</v>

43
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.481
<v Speaker 1>I was into it.</v>

45
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

46
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I like a thick girl anyway.</v>

47
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

48
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>But my girl now is not very small,</v>

49
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>but the deal with it,</v>

50
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.801
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

51
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I love her and she's great.</v>

52
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>She's hot.</v>

53
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>If we were in ski clothes,</v>

54
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.411
<v Speaker 1>so it does,</v>

55
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.101
<v Speaker 1>I'll feed her a lot.</v>

56
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You know those relationships where there's a feeder,</v>

57
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.833
<v Speaker 1>do you know about that?</v>

58
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>No guys that are real.</v>

59
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.071
<v Speaker 1>This is like where,</v>

60
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>where the fat thing he go.</v>

61
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It goes beyond just like a,</v>

62
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>like I think it's hot and even to like a like a fetish.</v>

63
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be a guy like me,</v>

64
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>like a skinny kind of weekly and guy that's like bringing his fat girlfriend</v>

65
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>like Twinkies and and Ho Hos and roast beef and stuffing and just be like,</v>

66
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:19.981
<v Speaker 1>here honey,</v>

67
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you keep eating.</v>

68
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>And she gets bigger and bigger.</v>

69
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a feed or,</v>

70
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>and then there's like a big woman that just eventually I guess grows and grows</v>

71
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>and grows and his erection grows with her or something like that.</v>

72
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

73
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>What know this relationship is defined.</v>

74
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say there's a type like yeah,</v>

75
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>this is defined like websites where they talk about this.</v>

76
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:39.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could look that up.</v>

78
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's that I'm not,</v>

79
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.153
<v Speaker 1>but is it like a,</v>

80
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>is there a community?</v>

81
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

84
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a community because they have to bring,</v>

85
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>they have to get,</v>

86
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get that many cranes to bring people to the meetings.</v>

87
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:52.111
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

88
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean like an online community where this is all discussed.</v>

89
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

90
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:55.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:56.664
<v Speaker 1>this is a real thing.</v>

93
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of it?</v>

94
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of that.</v>

95
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you been trying this with your new girl?</v>

96
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

97
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

98
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

99
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:01.834
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

101
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

102
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

103
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

104
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>no I'm not,</v>

105
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>it was never like that for me.</v>

106
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like a weird psychological,</v>

107
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to bring you food.</v>

108
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>It's being dominated by one person that's passive.</v>

109
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

110
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

112
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the dominatrix in this case doesn't even have to do anything but sit around and</v>

114
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

115
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

116
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

117
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

118
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.821
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

119
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I even brought that up.</v>

120
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>That's weird sex stuff.</v>

121
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>So this person was,</v>

122
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>was big and I went to the store,</v>

123
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:26.844
<v Speaker 1>she was the,</v>

124
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>she was the parking attendant at the store.</v>

125
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>And this is like well into comedy,</v>

126
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>so I'm okay on some level of public figure.</v>

127
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:34.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>not like a huge public figure,</v>

129
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but enough that it's like,</v>

130
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be like at random approaching,</v>

131
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.291
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should,</v>

132
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

133
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.951
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

134
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:41.784
<v Speaker 1>this girl,</v>

135
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>she was bigger and she was a parking lot attendant at this store and I somehow</v>

136
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>started talking to her and got her phone number and then sort of texting with</v>

137
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 1>her and I,</v>

138
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.813
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

139
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>so I remember I had a show that night in Orange County.</v>

140
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I was at a,</v>

141
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.561
<v Speaker 1>I was at a,</v>

142
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.394
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

143
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.520
<v Speaker 1>a comedy show at Uc Irvine and I brought my friend Jacob Jacob sear off down to</v>

144
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

145
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>down to the show.</v>

146
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.421
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

147
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and she was texting with me while I was at the show in Orange County and was</v>

149
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:08.890

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

201
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>and I start driving through content and it's getting weirder and weirder and</v>

202
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse the further I go and I keep texting her and she's like,</v>

206
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's like an abandoned alley and it's like,</v>

207
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like you want to talk about having two different brains,</v>

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Her brothers are going to come out,</v>

227
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:45.634

<v Speaker 1>take a deep breath.</v>

242

287
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>raised her phone number and then I like maybe six months later I drove by that</v>

288

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.813
<v Speaker 1>You're average,</v>

413
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>a sexual deviant and that way,</v>

414
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.101
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

415
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's like for me,</v>

416
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to get off on like hooking up with people that were not as a truck.</v>

417
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I was Han purpose.</v>

418
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It was hot,</v>

419
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I was fine to them.</v>

421
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

422
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And I would find a objective attractiveness in people that weren't objectively</v>

423
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:37.944
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

424
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

425
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:39.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

426
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

427
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.651
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

428
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So what we were talking about earlier,</v>

429
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.021
<v Speaker 2>like that's your,</v>

430
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:43.854
<v Speaker 2>your kink.</v>

431
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So like the drug thing,</v>

432
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever led you to be an impulsive drug person led you for awhile to be an</v>

433
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>impro impulsive sex person.</v>

434
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 2>So wasn't even almost a natural sort of attraction.</v>

435
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:54.151
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

436
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:54.361
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

437
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.440

440
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I love her personality.</v>

441
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even like her personality.</v>

442
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 2>She's talking about dropping embalmed</v>

443
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.653
<v Speaker 1>Nigga dicks.</v>

444
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

445
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you'll like us still.</v>

446
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.070
<v Speaker 1>There's something about you that's hot.</v>

447
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough though,</v>

448
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:09.734
<v Speaker 1>I actually have one.</v>

449
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

450
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>It's real big and black and where it was a shocker to her,</v>

451
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.493
<v Speaker 1>she was really fun.</v>

452
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.883
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

453
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.063
<v Speaker 1>look where I live.</v>

454
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

457
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:26.601
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

458
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:27.380
<v Speaker 1>That became the thing.</v>

459
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And it also is very compartmentalized.</v>

460
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I would be like in a store.</v>

461
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember one instance in particular,</v>

462
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I was at this store at like two o'clock in the morning shopping for,</v>

463
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I was at Safeway getting some groceries and this woman walked around the corner</v>

464
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.310
<v Speaker 1>and she was big and in the way that I liked and I started.</v>

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even flirting with this woman.</v>

481
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no way she's fucking mate.</v>

482
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 1>That's go so crazy.</v>

483
00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's just cause she's big or something.</v>

484
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:09.231
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

486
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>What else could it be if it wasn't a big thing?</v>

487
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

488
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:12.104
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're right.</v>

489
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>

490
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must be right.</v>

491
00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:15.920
<v Speaker 1>That's when it would get the most pronounced.</v>

492
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty intense.</v>

493
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.611
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

494
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

495
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I've had sex where I lie,</v>

496
00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:25.490
<v Speaker 1>sold after the woman left because he thought I was rational.</v>

497
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You thought it was rational?</v>

498
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

499
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:29.150
<v Speaker 1>cause I know she was like scratching this area of her body.</v>

500
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.411
<v Speaker 1>When she left,</v>

501
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like freaked out so hard that I went into my bathroom.</v>

502
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I started life solving my legs like shape and then dish soap and then salt.</v>

503
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And the next day I,</v>

504
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.140
<v Speaker 1>speaking of 12 step meetings,</v>

505
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I went to my first and only sex addicts anonymous meeting.</v>

506
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.641
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

507
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:44.690
<v Speaker 1>something's got to change.</v>

508
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.660
<v Speaker 1>To look at your face was awesome.</v>

509
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

510
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

511
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.651
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

512
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 1>there's very little way for you to convince yourself that you're just like a</v>

513
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>young man swinging around,</v>

514
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.300
<v Speaker 1>having a good time,</v>

515
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>engaging in the regular sexuality of all human beings.</v>

516
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>When you're spraying Lysol.</v>

517
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.724
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

518
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.321

520
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:06.664
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

521
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>oh that's awesome.</v>

522
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.910
<v Speaker 1>So I went and one of the things about s sex,</v>

523
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

524
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I realized when I got to a sex addicts anonymous meeting is I</v>

525
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>may have a problem or something.</v>

526
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I may have a compulsive sexuality,</v>

527
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have what these people have.</v>

528
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

529
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>there's something else that they're talking about.</v>

530
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>What were they talking about?</v>

531
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about,</v>

532
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.551
<v Speaker 1>I'll look,</v>

533
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll start looking at pornography at 4:00 PM and then all of a sudden the sun</v>

534
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:29.734
<v Speaker 1>will be coming up.</v>

535
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

536
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

537
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.331
<v Speaker 1>I had a home,</v>

540
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>but I took all of my money and spent it on prostitutes,</v>

541
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:38.494
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

543
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And Wow.</v>

544
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 1>It was very intense.</v>

545
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.350
<v Speaker 1>It was stuff that I did not really fully relate to.</v>

546
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
