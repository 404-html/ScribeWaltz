00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much material do you think?</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you're going to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big name standup comedian,</v>

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to put out a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of specials.</v>

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you put out how many specials can</v>

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you do on your life before you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking about other shit?</v>

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 2>or five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five specials.</v>

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Just cause a lot of stuff that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember it like it was so edit time,</v>

9
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 2>like I can laugh at it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back then it was paying.</v>

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't get all drugs like my sister</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother didn't got on drugs to deal</v>

12
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 2>with bullshit that we was going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

13
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:35.641
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>sober thought he mava goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to get rid of the pain,</v>

15
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I just kept putting it in the back of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I became a comic,</v>

17
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 2>all of this shit start rushing through</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain and I have to ask my sister,</v>

18
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this real?</v>

19
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I just asked my sister the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my granddaddy ran a bootleg house.</v>

20
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>So in this bootleg house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a retarded uncle named uncle cecil</v>

21
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 2>that was crippled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my granddad would buy him pussy on</v>

22
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But me and my sister would have to go in</v>

23
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 2>there with a prostitute and hold his</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs back until he gets his dicky before</v>

24
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 2>we could go outside and play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I called her up and I said,</v>

25
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 2>is this shit real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a hold his legs back cause he's</v>

26
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 2>a cripple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how when they need so he</v>

27
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't get it in until we move this</v>

28
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking legs back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

29
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurry up probably eight.</v>

30
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh go see.</v>

31
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 3>So stop fucking smile because they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>retarded.</v>

32
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:35.211
<v Speaker 3>He's</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 3>He's so fucking off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I asked my brother,</v>

34
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:39.674
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do y'all</v>

35
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>limited shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going crazy and all.</v>

36
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on brother.</v>

37
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Last weekend I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Mama used to have this theory.</v>

38
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>She's saying when when it rains and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>signage shine,</v>

39
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>the devil was beating his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of that?</v>

40
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you say,</v>

41
00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>if it will rain and the lightning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the song was shot,</v>

42
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 2>he caught the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheeky.</v>

43
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.193
<v Speaker 2>He's all season.</v>

44
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You should be the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause she don't believe in God</v>

45
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 3>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about you crazy.</v>

46
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Somebody I used to think they stole me</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

47
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 3>And it's fucking crazy.</v>

48
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I am being distracted by how much I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to urinate.</v>

49
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day I was thinking about,</v>

50
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad gas just started man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

51
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>but I was not prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a water.</v>

52
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I drank a whole one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

53
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And then I had Andre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Stay healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>and I had a bunch of coffee this morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

56
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking yesterday,</v>

57
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>this is related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much would you weigh if you never</v>

58
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>went to the bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be dead.</v>

59
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>How quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't take long.</v>

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we had evolved to just not ever</v>

61
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a baby after just a month would</v>

62
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>be bigger than the biggest human ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do the math.</v>

63
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you need to consume.</v>

64
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your body was so efficient that you</v>

65
00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>no longer to urinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we kind of assumed that your body</v>

66
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>would need to urinate.</v>

67
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your body needs water to stay alive,</v>

68
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we assuming that it has to</v>

69
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>protest to get water waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it doesn't have one anymore?</v>

70
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Well why could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we just turn that into more hair</v>

71
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>instead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why does it have to get rid of</v>

72
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't it possible that we can</v>

73
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>become so efficient that we no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to get rid of waste and we can just</v>

74
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>sort of exist by breathing completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like self.</v>

75
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

76
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean to get to a certain size and once</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to a certain size,</v>

77
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever you evaporate off by walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around like that you have to take back</v>

79
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

80
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

81
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have,</v>

82
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots that that just dissipate heat.</v>

83
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.820
<v Speaker 1>They don't have her make a waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

84
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Your laptop doesn't create as much waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human,</v>

85
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not nearly as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

86
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

87
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways it's more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been able to make machines that</v>

88
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>can poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put food in and then it's got</v>

89
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and different pumps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reservoirs inside and it creates</v>

90
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>something that resembles completely and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smells just like a human dump.</v>

91
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one I saw was done as a piece</v>

92
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>of art as art work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an artist created this machine that</v>

93
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>could poop just like a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

94
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>now they do it ad they call it a Robo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gut.</v>

95
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a medical thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have gi problems of poop,</v>

96
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>transplant is commonly used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce the healthy bacteria and</v>

97
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>taking poop from someone else and giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the sick person,</v>

98
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>shoving it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is kind of like,</v>

99
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of possibilities for</v>

100
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection,</v>

101
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

102
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>But the Robo Gut can make just perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean poop just with the kind that you</v>

103
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

104
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>You get some artificial poop put up</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of you to fix any imbalances that</v>

106
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you have in your gut flora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fast.</v>

107
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And that crazy can have like a poop farm</v>
<v Speaker 1>of robot intestine,</v>

108
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That are just,</v>

109
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and what do you feed them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Digital digitally do burger runs for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robo guts and then they totally are.</v>

111
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be totally organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to probably,</v>

112
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it's probably just like a paste or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid.</v>

113
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like baby food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't have to taste good.</v>

114
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.710
<v Speaker 1>The robot's not going to complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eat it,</v>

116
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you remember when Jay z went to Cuban</v>
<v Speaker 1>and got in trouble and everything,</v>

118
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the media was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look it does he know that that um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

120

<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is going on?</v>

121
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest and Che Guevara</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dialing 1964 or something with a Che</v>

122
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Guevara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also went over to,</v>

123
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and Golan fought like the revolution in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

124
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's really true,</v>

125
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the perfect guy though.</v>

126
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It'd be on a tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just looked like such a great</v>

127
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that wore a Che Guevara</v>

<v Speaker 1>Guevara support that happened like,</v>

130
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>like a decade ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can know one body was really what they</v>

131
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>were talking about.</v>
