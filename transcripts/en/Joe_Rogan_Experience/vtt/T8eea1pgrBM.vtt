13
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>changed your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not real.</v>

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.220

<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

20
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I got into guns and I wanted to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching gun videos and so I wanted to </v>

21
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.841
<v Speaker 1>make a youtube channel and I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use my real name because I thought </v>

22
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.991
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't cool enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said your name wasn't cooling </v>

23
00:00:59.991 --> 00:00:59.991
<v Speaker 1>to know I didn't want to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

55
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to him to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know why he called me </v>

56
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>rapper and Houston by that name.</v>

59
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Killer corleone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

61
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if maybe he listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and then my name Collins and then </v>

63
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>called me on and so forth and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how did you get wrapped up with the </v>

65
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>NRA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should,</v>

66
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>we should cover a couple of things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin story.</v>

67
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of like a spokesperson </v>

68
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>for the NRA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not official spokesperson,</v>

69
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>not official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unofficial.</v>

70
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a member of the NRA.</v>

71
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Do they recognize you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they appreciate you?</v>

72
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>So the way it started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my had a friend of mine,</v>

77
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>a good friend of mine who called me up </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day and was like,</v>

78
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>do you want to go shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

79
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>because at the time I really wasn't pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun and this was about,</v>

80
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I was around 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 34,</v>

81
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.190
<v Speaker 1>so this is 10 years ago and I hesitate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because my background growing</v>

82
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:18.361
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't grow up with guns in the </v>

83
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:18.361
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>no one in my family had a gun and for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea and the notion of being a young</v>

85
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>black male with a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

86
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I only saw three exactly through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lens of,</v>

87
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gang Banger,</v>

88
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth and so on.</v>

89
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's the mindset I had when with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to firearms,</v>

90
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

91
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize it wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of it until I started getting </v>

92
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.760
<v Speaker 1>into this very heavy and realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

93
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like that didn't realize </v>

94
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

95
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:45.691
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I told myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I afraid of essentially what is </v>

96
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>an inanimate object?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

97
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

98
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to go,</v>

99
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

100
00:03:55.511 --> 00:04:00.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go ahead and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I remember getting to the range,</v>

101
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>we get to the range and we walk them </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the door and then I hear the </v>

102
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>door for where the actual bays are and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard a pop pop,</v>

103
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>pop go off and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>

104
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:14.371
<v Speaker 1>this is actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I kind of had this nervousness </v>

105
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:14.371
<v Speaker 1>but I'm with my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

106
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't want my friend to feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

107
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting kind of like a bitch.</v>

108
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of kept it to myself.</v>

109
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>You get to the counter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do all the paperwork that,</v>

110
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent paperwork,</v>

111
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:26.930
<v Speaker 1>like billy phones all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and he has his gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to Malmo,</v>

113
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>we go to the lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was the very last lane,</v>

114
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the range was top gun in Houston </v>

115
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and so we go to very last range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives me kind of like a brief </v>

116
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>instruction about how to shoot the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to load it,</v>

117
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>so forth and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point,</v>

118
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>remember picking up the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified not knowing what to expect,</v>

119
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>not knowing what was gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember picking it up.</v>

120
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a little tourist ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 1:11</v>

121
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>millennium in 40 caliber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a subcompact probably not </v>

122
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the best first time shooting the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

123
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gun itself was small caliber </v>

124
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of kick you.</v>

125
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my experience,</v>

126
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>anybody who watched that as a gun person</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>

127
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not gonna end.</v>

128
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

129
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So I remember standing at the bay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then taking a gun and pointing it and </v>

130
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>shooting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember just the concussive </v>

131
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explosion,</v>

132
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the gun dancing in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

133
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was terrifying.</v>

134
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>They're to shout it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

135
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:38.521
<v Speaker 1>I liked this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the weird thing is it not in a way </v>

136
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>that most people think the nerdy aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my brain kicked in,</v>

137
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

138
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm taking this project down.</v>

139
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm launching it right several feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

140
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second shot allowed me to realize </v>

141
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.231
<v Speaker 1>what just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just contained an explosion in my </v>

142
00:05:58.231 --> 00:05:58.231
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

143
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't find that amazing,</v>

144
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

145
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.100
<v Speaker 2>The thing that people are bothered by is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what comes with it and how people use </v>

146
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:13.271
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think an analogy that's a fair </v>

147
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:17.531
<v Speaker 2>analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people reject is driving cars and a </v>

148
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 2>lot of these fucking psychos that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been running over people in the street.</v>

149
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just happened again,</v>

150
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Perlin somewhere somewhere in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guy ran a bunch of people over and </v>

151
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>then blew his brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

152
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 2>it's an object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

153
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that you use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a huge car guy to Sam as well.</v>

154
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 2>I love cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if someone said we have to ban </v>

156
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 2>cars because people started running </v>
<v Speaker 2>people over with cars,</v>

157
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

158
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're dealing with a whole bunch</v>

159
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

160
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we will probably agree on.</v>

161
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we can agree on is all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mass shootings are horrific.</v>

162
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrifying.</v>

163
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an evil,</v>

164
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing that here's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

165
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>No NRA members are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that's really </v>

166
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 2>kind of fucked up about people getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry at the NRA.</v>

167
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never had a mass shooting ever </v>

168
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can recall that was done by an </v>

169
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 2>NRA member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked.</v>

170
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.711
<v Speaker 2>I tried to find one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find a mass shooting that was </v>

171
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 2>perpetrated by an MRI NRA member and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's.</v>

172
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>So the biggest problem that a lot of gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>owners,</v>

173
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:27.581
<v Speaker 2>especially NRA members have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like the conversation that's being </v>

174
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:31.211
<v Speaker 2>had is basically coloring or actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgetting the human element behind </v>

175
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 2>those three letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the NRA isn't like this demigod </v>

176
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.560
<v Speaker 2>that just sits in the cloud of Olympia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is just one big guy that just </v>

177
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>orchestrating this entire thing.</v>

178
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

179
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 2>you're talking 5 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

180
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a,</v>

181
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member,</v>

182
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I am a gun owner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

183
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:52.601
<v Speaker 2>That that's who I am along with 5 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million other people who were that way </v>

184
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:56.741
<v Speaker 2>and then there were a ton of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who think they're in our members </v>

185
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>in art and then a ton of other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who probably don't mind being an Ra </v>

186
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.321
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just haven't gotten around with </v>

187
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 2>doing it and getting the membership and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of those people.</v>

188
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying that just to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're good people.</v>

189
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I think there's quite a few good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

190
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.650
<v Speaker 2>the people that are perpetrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these mass shootings are definitely </v>

191
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>not good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's wrong with them?</v>

192
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's wrong with them.</v>

193
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Guns not guns that are wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use the guns to express what's </v>

194
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them.</v>

195
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody wants to look at the </v>

196
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:29.170
<v Speaker 2>object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I get what's easier?</v>

197
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is easier and it's something that </v>

198
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.180
<v Speaker 2>everyone's pointing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

199
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 2>why do you need an Ar 15?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need to do this?</v>

200
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are good questions.</v>

201
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I need that Fucking Samurai sword</v>

202
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:41.860
<v Speaker 2>over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

203
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing too though,</v>

204
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.270
<v Speaker 2>and I've said it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we are a victim of our own </v>

205
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.270
<v Speaker 2>success in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

206
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I do think this is the greatest country </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

207
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is is</v>

208
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.250
<v Speaker 1>this country was built on an ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation that I think it aids in that </v>

209
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.600
<v Speaker 1>our ability to be as great as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we live in a world now where people </v>

210
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>don't see the necessity for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was never,</v>

211
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.800
<v Speaker 1>that was never supposed to be seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the lens of necessity in the </v>

212
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.961
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Second Amendment doesn't give me a </v>

213
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:17.661
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It preserves something that already </v>

214
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:17.661
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is we have a culture of</v>

215
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:22.521
<v Speaker 1>people who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who look at the second amendment as a </v>

216
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:22.521
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a right there,</v>

217
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>look at it as a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why they say,</v>

218
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need that?</v>

219
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need more than 10 rounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need this?</v>

220
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

221
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reframing the entire conversation </v>

222
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>underneath when that's not what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second amendment is about.</v>

223
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a right that I've already had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural right that I had the </v>

224
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>moment that I stepped foot on this earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person.</v>

225
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>The right to self defense is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is universal.</v>

226
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people say,</v>

227
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a right,</v>

228
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but obviously there's a problem so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do something about it.</v>

229
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have to give up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

230
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the common conversation and it's</v>

231
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 2>very flippant and it's not well thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and there's no,</v>

232
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 2>no consideration whatsoever to mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health issues.</v>

233
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I think because I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the primary problem </v>

234
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this from the get go.</v>

235
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.961
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the primary problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mental health issue and </v>

236
00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:14.961
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

237
00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 2>that's simplifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

238
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

239
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>it's ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

240
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it's there's something wrong when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this many people on mental health </v>

241
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.571
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you look at the number of </v>

242
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 2>mass shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost universal.</v>

243
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Almost every single one of them is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of psychiatric medication.</v>

244
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>But that's not a part of the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a part of the conversation.</v>

245
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 2>The conversation is always get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

246
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't want crazy people to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

247
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you do either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

248
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So outside of taking away the rights to </v>

249
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 2>have guns from normal law abiding people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yourself and myself,</v>

250
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

251
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.230
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to frame the </v>

253
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.230
<v Speaker 2>conversation and into specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

254
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 2>You're a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

256
00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:08.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you understand bills and amendments </v>

257
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:08.971
<v Speaker 2>and law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

258
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I think one word lumping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire conversation in one category,</v>

259
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to talk about school </v>

260
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 1>shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about school shootings,</v>

261
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I say is,</v>

262
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>because for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in it,</v>

263
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.960
<v Speaker 1>so I'd like to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you guys just don't want any</v>

264
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 2>gun laws and you say no to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have no true.</v>

265
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.730
<v Speaker 2>But to stand up for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because all they want to do is take</v>

266
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 2>away the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.790
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take away the guns.</v>

268
00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:38.140
<v Speaker 2>You're saying we're not going to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>away the guns.</v>

269
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.060
<v Speaker 2>You guys just don't want to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns taken away.</v>

270
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

271
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:46.190
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to get their guns take </v>

272
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.131
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I get labeled a monster as a </v>

273
00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:49.531
<v Speaker 2>result of saying exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want kids to die and it's a fucking </v>

274
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Speaker 2>real sneaky conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disingenuous.</v>

275
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the odd thing about</v>

276
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it is it's you see anybody who's paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the discourse in way it's </v>

277
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially on social media.</v>

278
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who follows my twitter,</v>

279
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.510
<v Speaker 1>my twitter account knows this multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasions I've tried to have a rational </v>

280
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:12.091
<v Speaker 1>conversation with people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete opposite side of my spectrum </v>

281
00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this issue.</v>

282
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Is there any of this online or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates or anything like that?</v>

283
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

284
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tweets going back and forth.</v>

285
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do anything rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can occasionally,</v>

286
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you got the American people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>

287
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.140
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't see me flustered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to me rationally because I'm </v>

288
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.340
<v Speaker 1>had this right of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I actually have to check myself </v>

290
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.441
<v Speaker 1>about that a little bit because how am I</v>
<v Speaker 1>any better than the people on the other </v>

291
00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:43.651
<v Speaker 1>side if I had the same at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy that they have towards me.</v>

292
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've started,</v>

293
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

294
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>because I can be incredibly snarky like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can and it's partly due because of my </v>

295
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:55.540
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all assholes,</v>

296
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 1>just like all the friends I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

297
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I grew up arguing with a group of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>who when they were losing it logically,</v>

298
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.200
<v Speaker 1>they went to jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

299
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a man pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

300
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It took me a second to realize it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was the one in law school,</v>

301
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:16.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the one that was going to law </v>

302
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:16.591
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

303
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything I did was focused and </v>

304
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>center through the idea of logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

305
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.501
<v Speaker 1>logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not making any sense and you </v>

306
00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:23.260
<v Speaker 1>crack a joke and everyone's laughing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized there's some power to that.</v>

307
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

308
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you should know something about </v>

309
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little for sure.</v>

310
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I took on some of those qualities</v>

311
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>in the way that I advocate for firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.720
<v Speaker 1>because it can be a little disarming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the disarming aspect of it can be </v>

313
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.441
<v Speaker 1>beneficial because it causes people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop their guard a little bit and then </v>

314
00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 1>when you drop your guard you can take in</v>
<v Speaker 1>information more objectively,</v>

315
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.090
<v Speaker 1>more so than waiting or looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias or in instigating your</v>

316
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:56.221
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dissonance because you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear the thing that is </v>

317
00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:56.221
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what you already believe.</v>

318
00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I just think you need a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

319
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.390
<v Speaker 2>like as a person to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate reasonably on twitter and </v>

320
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>lacking that.</v>

321
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:08.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like the ability to steal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one's looking the ability to shit</v>

322
00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:11.090
<v Speaker 2>on someone with no ida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye contact,</v>

323
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.200
<v Speaker 2>no social repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No know you're not feeling anything from</v>

324
00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 2>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say something rude to them.</v>

325
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.190
<v Speaker 2>They're not in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't feel terrible saying that.</v>

326
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

327
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna lie,</v>

328
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 1>so twitter isn't dirty place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dirty place,</v>

329
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great place to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it is,</v>

330
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.590
<v Speaker 1>it has its benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

331
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.060
<v Speaker 2>There's some really good conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be had on twitter and I've had a </v>

332
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.930
<v Speaker 2>really interesting moments on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've learned a lot about things </v>

333
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.570
<v Speaker 2>where people have sent me links and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>retweeted them and I've,</v>

334
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard sometimes,</v>

335
00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:50.081
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are so many people that </v>

336
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 2>are just unreasonable and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at communicating and they're happy.</v>

337
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.500
<v Speaker 2>They're not happy people and does a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people out there that just aren't </v>

338
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:56.500
<v Speaker 2>happy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

339
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be honest with you,</v>

340
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:02.501
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it until I got to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notoriety that I am now in the space </v>

341
00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>that I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

342
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 2>you're in a weird space because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the space of defending guns,</v>

343
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm black.</v>

344
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm relatively young.</v>

345
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on there.</v>

346
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 2>And we were a lawyer and I worked well.</v>

347
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>They tend to disregard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

348
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 2>they should probably pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

349
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

350
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm advocating also with certain three </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters behind me.</v>

351
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.150
<v Speaker 2>They automatically assume as the devil </v>
<v Speaker 2>for now.</v>

352
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 2>How does the NRA feel about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

353
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have conversations with them?</v>

354
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:34.211
<v Speaker 2>Are they saying good job or they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they pleased or as far as I can </v>

355
00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:34.211
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

356
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.790
<v Speaker 2>We still have the relationship we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very much a very symbiotic </v>

357
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.971
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird one right now because it's </v>

358
00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:42.971
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I hear from the NRA.</v>

359
00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I hear colon and then I hear Ted nugent.</v>

360
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two that I hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be honest.</v>

361
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:56.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the biggest fan of Ted </v>

362
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:56.681
<v Speaker 2>techniques rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

363
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 2>but I do know where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

364
00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't grow up listening to Ted </v>
<v Speaker 2>nugent.</v>

365
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not my demographic,</v>

366
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time to a new job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still an individual and people fail</v>

367
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 2>to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

368
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may be monolithic on that,</v>

369
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.880
<v Speaker 2>on the issue of firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not monolithic in the way we go </v>

370
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:14.880
<v Speaker 2>about expressing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

371
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.121
<v Speaker 2>he's right about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because someone's outrageous </v>

372
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean they're not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever seen his,</v>

373
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

374
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 2>the debate that he had in a gun store </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Piers Morgan.</v>

375
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

376
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.140
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is to do just incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>bright.</v>

377
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 2>It is smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy as hell.</v>

378
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he's crazy.</v>

379
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only.</v>

380
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 2>You can only kill so many things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

381
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Lose your fucking marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Lives on a ranch in Texas where it's</v>

382
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>all fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just shooting all animals.</v>

383
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 2>He hunts every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a psycho and I don't,</v>

384
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 2>with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of strangle hold.</v>

385
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.680
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how,</v>

386
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.800
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the line of demarcation between </v>

387
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.081
<v Speaker 2>becoming and not hurting enough in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of becoming a crossing over that line </v>

388
00:16:59.081 --> 00:16:59.850
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into sociopath?</v>

389
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just joking.</v>

390
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really depends entirely upon </v>

391
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.220
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing with the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know he gives it to hunters for </v>

392
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.071
<v Speaker 2>the hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he gives it to neighbors and </v>

393
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:12.670
<v Speaker 2>friends and there's nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

394
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And he asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually has a,</v>

395
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:21.130
<v Speaker 2>he has an obligation to be the steward </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his land because he has a lot of </v>

396
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.740
<v Speaker 2>exotic and stuff and I'm just totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>joking around.</v>

397
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

398
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.170
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

399
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.190
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to his conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piers Morgan,</v>

400
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 2>which Piers Morgan takes that flip in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left wing knee jerk reactionary,</v>

401
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regionally paragons.</v>

402
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a cunt.</v>

403
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's on with Ted,</v>

404
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Ted just knew everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual facts.</v>

405
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 2>When you start running around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics of gun violence,</v>

406
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:50.771
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know how many of those people </v>

407
00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:50.771
<v Speaker 2>were bad guys that were shot cops?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

408
00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many of those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people that were shot when they </v>

409
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.151
<v Speaker 1>were breaking the people's homes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many of those people </v>

410
00:17:57.151 --> 00:17:57.151
<v Speaker 1>were people that were killed in self </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense?</v>

411
00:17:57.151 --> 00:17:57.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

412
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 1>how many of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say talking about gun violence,</v>

414
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 1>how many of the people were suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

415
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>

416
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind that's recent suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

417
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happened.</v>

418
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So when I started getting really deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the advocacy component of it,</v>

419
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>the everyone was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>

420
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 1>people die from gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>

421
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>people a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were running with.</v>

422
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And they were scaring all the suburban </v>
<v Speaker 1>House moms.</v>

423
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to do something about gun </v>

424
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:25.550
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to do something about guns.</v>

425
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped into the pool and I,</v>

426
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

427
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 1>something doesn't seem right about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure right now.</v>

428
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm is wrong about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed inflated.</v>

429
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It seemed inflated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>

430
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It's on a subconscious level as or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

431
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was me looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias,</v>

432
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I felt the way I did about </v>

433
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest and say that.</v>

434
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did is I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>researched a little more than I realize </v>

435
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 65 percent of that 30,000</v>

436
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.390
<v Speaker 1>suicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 percent real.</v>

437
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>He's just Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that like 18,000</v>

438
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>people a day shoot themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

439
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we say at the top of the show?</v>

440
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And people are miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

441
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking crazy number though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

442
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a Kevin Hart concerts pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>

443
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Goodnight everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's really what it is.</v>

444
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 1>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

445
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.170
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it.</v>

446
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But then it begs the question that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up before the mental health </v>

447
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

448
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

449
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many lives would we actually save if</v>

450
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:31.011
<v Speaker 1>we took the same energy we applied to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just making guns evil and trying to ban </v>

451
00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 1>guns and take that energy and put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards understanding what it is.</v>

452
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Why as a society we have a society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so eager to really not want to be </v>

453
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 1>here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

454
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Expand that a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we have all the guns in the </v>

455
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 1>universe here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

456
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Compared to any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yet our suicide rates should be </v>

457
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 1>exceedingly higher than all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that don't have as many guns.</v>

458
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

459
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You look at the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at Japan,</v>

460
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Japan has double our suicide rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it really?</v>

461
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double.</v>

462
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

463
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:10.761
<v Speaker 1>So 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people a day in Japan or whatever the </v>

464
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:10.761
<v Speaker 1>fuck per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smaller.</v>

465
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Not Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every year.</v>

466
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>per annual.</v>

467
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said that you go complaint numbers</v>

468
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

469
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Did I say a day earlier or did I say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>

470
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A day?</v>

471
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Because you owe $30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

473
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Day $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

474
00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't sound that bad because $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million people.</v>

475
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would,</v>

476
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you would think about it predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis?</v>

477
00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:33.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

478
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

479
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Annually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annually.</v>

480
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I think that?</v>

481
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've said on accident </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

482
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everyone.</v>

483
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Thirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Thirty thousand pounds in a year from </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun violence.</v>

485
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Call it gun gun fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in reality you break those numbers </v>

486
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.350
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes contact with San Francisco,</v>

487
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 1>65 percent of those are suicides in </v>
<v Speaker 1>about five percent of those are,</v>

488
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are God dammit.</v>

489
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I think justified homicides including </v>
<v Speaker 1>times when cops shoot someone in self </v>

490
00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 1>defense and it's justified right in self</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense shooting.</v>

491
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they count times when cops really</v>

492
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.870
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have shot somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did,</v>

493
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they do.</v>

495
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 1>But even then that number would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceedingly marginal comparatively.</v>

496
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have the remaining number </v>

497
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:22.700
<v Speaker 1>which are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have like three to five.</v>

498
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 15 percent of justified.</v>

499
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Three to five percent are accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three to five percent a lot.</v>

500
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

501
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's with 900 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>900 people a year.</v>

502
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

503
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and I tweeted this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said again,</v>

504
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 1>if we focused on firearm safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

505
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that number will drop in half.</v>

506
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It might be you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fix the intelligence level </v>

507
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 1>of the human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See as fucking around with guns.</v>

508
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:58.291
<v Speaker 1>That's where you underestimate the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nursemaid how those people are </v>

509
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:01.291
<v Speaker 1>dying because accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were a lot of people who </v>

510
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 1>don't understand basic gun safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

511
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Within that 900,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of them.</v>

512
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see some of the accidents that </v>

513
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.131
<v Speaker 1>happens with firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're easily mitigated by just simply </v>

514
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 1>knowing the four rules of firearm </v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership.</v>

515
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And when you get into the gun community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as a whole,</v>

516
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you follow that rabbit instance like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

517
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.120
<v Speaker 1>we're crazy about gun safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

518
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your finger on a trigger and a </v>

519
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're slaughtering you.</v>

520
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Literally,</v>

521
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>but you know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

522
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Like we're going to hold your </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>

523
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who has so many guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know how many guns.</v>

524
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 1>How many guns you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Justin.</v>

525
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I know you're listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit gun.</v>

526
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Nut and great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

527
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how many guns I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either a fucking crazy person.</v>

528
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess.</v>

529
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again I didn't shoot my first </v>

530
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

531
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Toilet Twenty three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

532
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

533
00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 1>did that just become crazy all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden?</v>

534
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I was about the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

535
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I shot one when I was real young</v>

536
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and I definitely shot one in camp when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

537
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was probably 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that I didn't count that I've </v>

538
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.150
<v Speaker 1>shot my first handgun when I first came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to California and I might've been really</v>

539
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

540
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.270
<v Speaker 1>what's ironic is it's way easier to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gun here.</v>

541
00:23:14.271 --> 00:23:16.790
<v Speaker 1>That is New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in New York too.</v>

542
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hard to get a handgun in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

543
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You legally?</v>

544
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legally or illegally?</v>

545
00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I came here it was a 1994 I </v>

547
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 93,</v>

548
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.730
<v Speaker 1>94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a gun and I was like,</v>

549
00:23:35.731 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I just buy a gun to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

550
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

551
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I bought A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about 38 special about a Walter p,</v>

552
00:23:43.591 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>P K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I bought a glock nine millimeter</v>

553
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.350
<v Speaker 2>or made a good taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan.</v>

554
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of the PDK as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

555
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a cute little gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

556
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:58.901
<v Speaker 2>when I first came to California and her </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy shit about drive by </v>

557
00:23:58.901 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>shootings and gang violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was just going to be a</v>

558
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:04.211
<v Speaker 2>fucking war zone out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a funny thing about it is it's </v>

559
00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:05.830
<v Speaker 2>your natural disposition was I need </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to protect myself.</v>

560
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's such a natural thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why we've perverted it to </v>

561
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 2>this deal where it's like something has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wrong with you.</v>

562
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:16.991
<v Speaker 2>If you had that mentality or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that haven't </v>

563
00:24:16.991 --> 00:24:17.460
<v Speaker 2>experienced real violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.540
<v Speaker 2>and then if you've experienced real </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence and you've seen what happens </v>

565
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.510
<v Speaker 2>when you have a terrible person around </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't terrible,</v>

566
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:31.770
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a reality that people don't like </v>

567
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 2>to face and they don't like to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the coin.</v>

568
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever there's an instance where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a shooter,</v>

569
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 2>the shooter gets taken out by someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a trained person who's trained </v>

570
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>with firearms and and knows tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to talk about that.</v>

571
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 2>That just gets brushed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

572
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.250
<v Speaker 2>There's not a balanced conversation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be had.</v>

573
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.280
<v Speaker 2>There isn't an interesting thing is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a group to have a group chat when </v>

574
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they write it off as just anomalies.</v>

575
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that an anomaly?</v>

576
00:24:57.921 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what exactly what it's supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be used for.</v>

577
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

578
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>confirmation bias and cognitive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>distances are,</v>

579
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bitch.</v>

580
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.970
<v Speaker 2>We all suffer from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

581
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 2>To an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

582
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you add in the component of </v>

583
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

584
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't necessarily hate guns.</v>

585
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.870
<v Speaker 2>The sequences of being shot or someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>they love being shot in.</v>

586
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 2>One of the thing about it is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

587
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 2>those people never put themselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of being the shooter.</v>

588
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 2>They always put themselves in a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being the victim of a shooting.</v>

589
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

590
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 2>why do you need that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't see it as,</v>

591
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:34.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this allows me to better defend myself.</v>

592
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>They look at it from the perspective of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

593
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.470
<v Speaker 2>if you're able to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might use that against me.</v>

594
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also the,</v>

595
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 2>the looming specter of the mass shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so fucking common these days.</v>

596
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It seems like every three or four months</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a new instance,</v>

597
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 2>how many times per cent happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perception is a bitch,</v>

598
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is the absolute reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they have happened.</v>

599
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:04.810
<v Speaker 2>They are horrific and there's more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them here than anywhere else in the </v>

600
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:04.810
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

601
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.560
<v Speaker 2>That's reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the good.</v>

602
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 2>So when you say that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the developer world,</v>

603
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.040
<v Speaker 2>correct your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's usually the caveat they </v>

604
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.171
<v Speaker 2>like to play on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no mass shootings in the </v>

605
00:26:22.171 --> 00:26:24.570
<v Speaker 2>undeveloped world is people don't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go into a fucking mall and shoot people </v>

606
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:24.570
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's windshield shade?</v>

607
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.080
<v Speaker 2>It's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very rare.</v>

608
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Where people take it happens more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>people realize.</v>

609
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.620
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't.</v>

610
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.340
<v Speaker 2>A report on how many people die in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago in a weekend,</v>

611
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.860
<v Speaker 2>over a weekend that doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>reported.</v>

612
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we live in America where we have </v>

613
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.870
<v Speaker 2>complete access to information that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

614
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's a different kind of violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's people that are actively to</v>

615
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 2>get people that are actively trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them.</v>

616
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's gang violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas school shootings are completely </v>

617
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 2>innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>School shootings are the worst,</v>

618
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:55.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a child and some fucking </v>

619
00:26:55.611 --> 00:26:58.221
<v Speaker 2>psycho decides to make the most noise </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible by going into a school and </v>

620
00:26:58.221 --> 00:26:58.221
<v Speaker 2>shooting it up.</v>

621
00:26:58.221 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the scariest and the worst for </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people.</v>

622
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 2>For most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about gang violence,</v>

623
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

624
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that's violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible that people got shot,</v>

625
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's people that are trying to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

626
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.620
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then when I tell you that the </v>

627
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 2>remaining homicides in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at 30,000</v>

628
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:18.141
<v Speaker 2>number that I gave you manually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 80 percent of that is gang </v>

629
00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:19.910
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy to think and believe it.</v>

630
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's when you see Sandy Hook,</v>

631
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:28.731
<v Speaker 2>when you see Parkland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see any that the shooting in </v>

632
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aurora in the movie theater,</v>

633
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.030
<v Speaker 2>when you see these mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are what terrify people.</v>

634
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are not necessarily terrified of </v>

635
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>the gang violence in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

636
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Chicago in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>months and not one fucking person has </v>

637
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:42.200
<v Speaker 2>brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

638
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 2>it places a warzone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>

639
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Chicago.</v>

640
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.570
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get deep dish pizza like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows your fly.</v>

641
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

642
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to the south side.</v>

643
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

644
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went to Chicago.</v>

645
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 2>It was just in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was here and they were like,</v>

646
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you locked and loaded.</v>

647
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Did you wear a vest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

648
00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got all those questions,</v>

649
00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:04.901
<v Speaker 2>but I said I was going to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the first things that people </v>

650
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:04.901
<v Speaker 2>told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

651
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:05.570
<v Speaker 2>granted I did go to south side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did feel like.</v>

652
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

653
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Would you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you nervous?</v>

654
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Were you walking around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't nervous.</v>

655
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not superman man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're walking around,</v>

656
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:14.160
<v Speaker 2>he's strapped a not in Chicago because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal for me to be.</v>

657
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:19.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy is that Chicago has </v>
<v Speaker 2>really strict gun laws and that they </v>

658
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 2>don't work at all.</v>

659
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I was driving down a road where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like six,</v>

660
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:27.081
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight dudes who jumped in front of the </v>

661
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:28.941
<v Speaker 2>car when we drove in there because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't look like we belonged there and </v>

662
00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single one of them had a gun.</v>

663
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 2>They jumped in front of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

664
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:34.290
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like little lob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies in front of the car.</v>

665
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:35.810
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

666
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 2>you said Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this unfamiliar driving down the side </v>

667
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they tried to stop you.</v>

668
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't try to stop me.</v>

669
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I think you're trying to figure out who </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell we were going over.</v>

670
00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 2>They were just trying to surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

671
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda one of those things,</v>

672
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

673
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:52.611
<v Speaker 2>when you're driving around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driving down the side street and </v>

674
00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:52.611
<v Speaker 2>south side Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go pros on the car.</v>

675
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

676
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of have that.</v>

677
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we all agree that gun violence,</v>

678
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.250
<v Speaker 2>especially in terms of mass shootings is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest problems that we have</v>

679
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like a horrific public image</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

680
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

681
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:14.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that you see in </v>

682
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.750
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I say public image,</v>

683
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I should,</v>

684
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I should phrase that what I mean as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>public perception problem.</v>

685
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it and it's just death and </v>

686
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 2>violence and children and innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we as,</v>

687
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.490
<v Speaker 2>as people I think consider the death of </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence to be one of the most </v>

688
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:34.510
<v Speaker 2>egregious and horrific deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we both agree on.</v>

689
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

690
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's 100 percent across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with any decent person.</v>

691
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 2>These mass shootings are horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in my opinion,</v>

692
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

693
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>the number one aspect of the argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not being discussed is the mental</v>

694
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 2>health aspect of it.</v>

695
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Are you opposed to more screening of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to get guns?</v>

696
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>

697
00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that,</v>

698
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:04.951
<v Speaker 2>in an ideal world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could minority report it and </v>

699
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:04.951
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who you.</v>

700
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:04.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority report.</v>

701
00:30:04.951 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean just like check to see if they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on metal,</v>

702
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 2>mental health medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean we,</v>

703
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 2>we currently have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

704
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this slippery slope with that too.</v>

705
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.650
<v Speaker 2>So what would constitute somebody being </v>
<v Speaker 2>on mental health medication that's </v>

706
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:16.650
<v Speaker 2>prohibitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I would,</v>

707
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>if I deal with anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm on Susanne's prescribed,</v>

708
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 2>is that prevent me from owning a </v>
<v Speaker 2>firearm?</v>

709
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In California for the longest time,</v>

710
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a medical marijuana card,</v>

711
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have a firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were doing that federally.</v>

712
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that there was a federal thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you had a legal medical </v>

713
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.981
<v Speaker 2>marijuana card that they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent people they were trying to </v>

714
00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:37.981
<v Speaker 2>prevent people from.</v>

715
00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to be trying to cripple</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marijuana industry because they knew</v>

716
00:30:41.531 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>that people wanted guns because to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>

717
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 2>it's intellectually dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can,</v>

718
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>if I can go to the store with a gun on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and buy alcohol,</v>

719
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

720
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:51.840
<v Speaker 2>and you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

721
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't even smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

722
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>But let's just be honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like alcohol,</v>

723
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think utilizing that as a </v>

724
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>prohibitive means to own a firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

725
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you were under the influence,</v>

726
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.110
<v Speaker 2>some of the Shit I got in the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

727
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're super paranoid.</v>

728
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't undo a gun and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say under the influence.</v>

729
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I said if I could all the all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana card.</v>

730
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Does this allow you to buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

731
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:23.581
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying that is an issue if </v>

732
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:23.581
<v Speaker 2>you're under the influence and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun,</v>

733
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:23.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

734
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm allowed to.</v>

735
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.980
<v Speaker 2>But I have you go to my house right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all types of whiskeys at home.</v>

736
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're under the influence,</v>

737
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

738
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't,</v>

739
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't carry a firearm and then drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

740
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be drunk with a gun.</v>

741
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.650
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be high as fuck when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>

742
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of those good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nor should you be driving.</v>

743
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Nor should you be driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So should you be on Xanax with a gun?</v>

744
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the question I don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to because I've never had xanax.</v>

745
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Neither.</v>

746
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that there's been people </v>

747
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that have killed people when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Xanax.</v>

748
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know that guy in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shooter in Vegas,</v>

749
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.660
<v Speaker 2>that guy was on anti anxiety medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that Chris Cornell was on </v>

750
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 2>anti anxiety medication when he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

751
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a profound effect on some </v>

752
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 2>individuals and it's not uniform the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affects you.</v>

753
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It might affect change with different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally different.</v>

754
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know,</v>

755
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I know tons of people who are on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

756
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they respond.</v>

757
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they respond to it differently.</v>

758
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:28.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know tons of people on it will </v>

759
00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:28.400
<v Speaker 2>also drink while they're on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're not supposed to.</v>

760
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

761
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.500
<v Speaker 2>that's not good either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

762
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 2>It's screening with the screening </v>
<v Speaker 2>component.</v>

763
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:40.111
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be careful because what it </v>

764
00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:40.111
<v Speaker 2>then does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

765
00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a de facto way of preventing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to own firearms arbitrarily.</v>

766
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

767
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have anxiety or even even </v>

768
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.400
<v Speaker 2>somebody who's maybe dealing with PTSD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody's dealing with PTSD is as </v>

769
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.471
<v Speaker 2>a potential murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ravenous 100 percent person who just </v>

770
00:32:55.471 --> 00:32:55.471
<v Speaker 2>want to go out and kill people.</v>

771
00:32:55.471 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with the screening component,</v>

772
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 2>that's why I say yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

773
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:04.150
<v Speaker 2>If you can find a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can find a way to establish a </v>

774
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>screw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mental screening bit,</v>

775
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.650
<v Speaker 2>even then no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's,</v>

776
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a due process aspect to it as </v>

777
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:11.730
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

778
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.770
<v Speaker 2>So you can prevent me from owning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't prevent me from exercising a </v>

779
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.521
<v Speaker 2>right if I haven't done something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolve myself from being able to do </v>

780
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:19.521
<v Speaker 2>that legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

781
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what if they come to your house and </v>

782
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.411
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you've got like a cork board </v>

783
00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:31.391
<v Speaker 2>up and you've got all these pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools and fucking arrows pointing to </v>

784
00:33:31.391 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 2>the emergency exits and plans of how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>block things off.</v>

785
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:39.671
<v Speaker 2>And then pictures of Jodie foster and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of serial killers up </v>

786
00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:44.411
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're on anti anxiety medications </v>

787
00:33:44.411 --> 00:33:44.411
<v Speaker 2>in the cops.</v>

788
00:33:44.411 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Talked to you and your fucking squirrely</v>
<v Speaker 2>as hell.</v>

789
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.160
<v Speaker 2>You haven't done anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

790
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Arrest me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if you can arrest me,</v>

791
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:51.250
<v Speaker 2>arrest can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't arrest me for,</v>

792
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 2>for a crime or possibly attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

793
00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.220
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the legal standard is like taking </v>

794
00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>substantial act to commit a crime even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though you don't do it.</v>

795
00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:04.301
<v Speaker 2>That's attempted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the kid that got </v>

796
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:04.301
<v Speaker 2>kicked out of school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

797
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>what was the school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was an Asian kid?</v>

798
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Died his hair blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started collecting bullets,</v>

799
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 2>got a semi automatic rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His friend started freaking out,</v>

800
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:14.880
<v Speaker 2>they called the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops came to visit him,</v>

801
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>he bought another rifle and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>they deported them.</v>

802
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 2>They deported him for reasons not having</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the firearms.</v>

803
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They deported him for reasons that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't actually going to anymore is on a</v>

804
00:34:25.261 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 2>green card or visa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

805
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:31.270
<v Speaker 2>But the way the sheriffs were framing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was they deported because they wanted </v>

806
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.751
<v Speaker 2>this fucking psycho out of the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think that they might've </v>

807
00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:34.751
<v Speaker 2>prevented a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably did,</v>

808
00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:39.580
<v Speaker 2>but they still had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still had to establish a legal </v>

809
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.150
<v Speaker 2>basis for deporting did all they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>

810
00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 2>that he didn't go to class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

811
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 2>that's something you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>

812
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

814
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

815
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was,</v>

816
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:53.170
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a requirement for him to </v>

817
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.170
<v Speaker 2>continue to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was really,</v>

818
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 2>it was Kinda like Kinda got like Al </v>
<v Speaker 2>Capone,</v>

819
00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:58.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got a component by tax evasion by </v>

820
00:34:58.571 --> 00:34:58.571
<v Speaker 2>way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

821
00:34:58.571 --> 00:34:58.571
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

822
00:34:58.571 --> 00:35:02.201
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he really had guns and was acting </v>

823
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.681
<v Speaker 2>crazy and that's why the kids that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends with them called and that's why </v>

824
00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 2>they acted and they just found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>loophole.</v>

825
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with someone like </v>

826
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:13.300
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

827
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had something.</v>

828
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 2>What if this kid was still going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school?</v>

829
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be pretty bad,</v>

830
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

831
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still,</v>

832
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.150
<v Speaker 2>we still have our laws for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

833
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.180
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our inherent rights for a </v>

834
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.180
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have to due process for a reason.</v>

835
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Because if we didn't have those right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone could just come up and say,</v>

836
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I saw I saw calling you on</v>

837
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>the war on instagram the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He a picture of a god and he</v>

838
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 1>was like cursing people out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making fun of him in the water </v>

839
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 1>he was drinking and so you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody needs to go check on them and </v>

840
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 1>make sure he's okay and somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take his guns away from him.</v>

841
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be through process.</v>

842
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I agree with you and,</v>

843
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate in that some people may</v>

844
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:58.580
<v Speaker 1>slip through the cracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

845
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 1>but I can arrest someone for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they haven't done yet.</v>

846
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't.</v>

847
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Well I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where we are right now.</v>

848
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:11.181
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that now we're getting to the </v>

849
00:36:11.181 --> 00:36:11.181
<v Speaker 1>complexities the hardest of the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

850
00:36:11.181 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

851
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:16.491
<v Speaker 1>How do we put something in place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch the people who do happen to fall </v>

852
00:36:16.491 --> 00:36:16.530
<v Speaker 1>between the cracks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

853
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

854
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.330
<v Speaker 1>well try to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

855
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw a hydro.</v>

856
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.880
<v Speaker 1>The complexities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

857
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex issue,</v>

858
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.710
<v Speaker 1>which is why we're not largely not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having it and we're having it here </v>

859
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.291
<v Speaker 1>because no one wants to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation on the national scene </v>

860
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard and it doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>for great sound bite and it doesn't make</v>

861
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:40.370
<v Speaker 1>for good TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

862
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Because if I hate doing cable news hits </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have two minutes to basically </v>

863
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.590
<v Speaker 1>reduce a complex issue that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>debating for decades,</v>

864
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:54.591
<v Speaker 1>almost centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst and it's also people </v>

865
00:36:54.591 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 1>talking over each other and there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or two boxes,</v>

866
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 1>one guy here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy there.</v>

867
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Usually you're not even in the same room</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go there.</v>

868
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to those earpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a delay.</v>

869
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Those things are a disaster or horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst ways to communicate,</v>

870
00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:07.570
<v Speaker 1>which is why I try to establish my </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform or my show war.</v>

871
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I try to have it as a platform that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>open to people to come on,</v>

872
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to come on and discuss this </v>

873
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By all means come to it.</v>

874
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you had anyone that's the really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strict anti-gun on.</v>

875
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had A.</v>

876
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I had an entire season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what we did in the season,</v>

877
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it was two seasons ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we brought on a young lady and a guy </v>

878
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 1>from New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

879
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 1>but he came on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were anti and so what we did was he</v>

880
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:39.891
<v Speaker 1>had a round table discussion at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of every episode of my show and we will </v>

881
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:43.281
<v Speaker 1>bring up a specific topic and we discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and so they basically was like two </v>

882
00:37:43.281 --> 00:37:46.180
<v Speaker 1>against one essentially until they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me about what their thoughts on,</v>

883
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 1>on what we talked about in the show or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular gun control issue and we had </v>

884
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.180
<v Speaker 1>that conversation had an individual.</v>

885
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I sit down with her as well when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about it and then took her to the</v>

886
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:57.610
<v Speaker 1>shooting range to shoot for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

887
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's going to be overlooked.</v>

888
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know they ignore it.</v>

889
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Well they probably aren't even aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because I wasn't aware of it.</v>

890
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you think people who need to be</v>

891
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of it because like for instance,</v>

892
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I bring this point up and it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 1>come across as if like I feel some type </v>

893
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>of way cause he didn't mention me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really that.</v>

894
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It just speaks volumes to what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing at for the longest.</v>

895
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:26.751
<v Speaker 1>They ignore rational discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Oliver did a 20 minute monologue on</v>

896
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Nra tv about NITV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

897
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how long?</v>

898
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's a long time.</v>

899
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>He didn't me once.</v>

900
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.610
<v Speaker 2>He didn't mention my shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three shows on NITV,</v>

901
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 2>three shows and I had the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>longest,</v>

902
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 2>longest running show on nitv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't mention me once.</v>

903
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 2>The level of detail that they went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>within that monologue lets me know.</v>

904
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>They watched everything on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

905
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.870
<v Speaker 2>They watched it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think you left?</v>

906
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't fit the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

907
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Also because he is a progressive guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with glasses who's white and you really </v>

908
00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you really sit and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything negative about black people?</v>

909
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's but he's not white though.</v>

910
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like me.</v>

911
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>What is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

912
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

913
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want Oliver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's white.</v>

914
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

915
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 2>If he's not white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not white.</v>

916
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.390
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irish,</v>

917
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My white.</v>

918
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is.</v>

919
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.460
<v Speaker 2>If I saw you on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in the olden days.</v>

920
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:35.461
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandparents weren't white when my </v>

921
00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:35.461
<v Speaker 2>grandparents came over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's white over white.</v>

922
00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:36.280
<v Speaker 2>He's white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White Paper,</v>

923
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.190
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>

925
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

926
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>What did you think he was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

927
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about him confused with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the daily show guy.</v>

928
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I probably am Trevor Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

929
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Speaker 2>not trevor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

930
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:50.700
<v Speaker 2>but I know about trevor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

931
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 2>he's white as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a white Englishman.</v>

932
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Minimum Racist.</v>

933
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 2>But for a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like that have dave.</v>

934
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about progressives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I like John Oliver.</v>

935
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not negative against John.</v>

936
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start doing a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

937
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I had this perspective up until this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

938
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shut off my belief system </v>

939
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.220
<v Speaker 2>and listen to you and listen to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're about to say because I haven't </v>

940
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>thought about this because I thought he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't white to this entire time.</v>

941
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.400
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

942
00:40:19.401 --> 00:40:21.030
<v Speaker 2>So now he's white as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

943
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not even above what.</v>

944
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>

945
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:29.401
<v Speaker 2>He might've found the worst examples and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you were too reasonable and it </v>

946
00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fit the narrative of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

947
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean his show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although his show has points and he </v>

948
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.551
<v Speaker 2>makes these very clear conclusions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny show.</v>

950
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:45.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing behind it is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>any girl who's dating me knows like I </v>

951
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.390
<v Speaker 2>have enough episodes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

952
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that platform.</v>

953
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You could find some stuff to make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me about Paul.</v>

954
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's the kind of </v>

955
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.631
<v Speaker 2>thing they're trying to make fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like individual personalities that say </v>

956
00:40:57.631 --> 00:41:00.931
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they're trying to do is </v>

957
00:41:00.931 --> 00:41:03.451
<v Speaker 2>point out the disingenuous narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the NRA while ignoring the </v>

958
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 2>disingenuous narrative from the anti gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocates.</v>

959
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

960
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I could possibly see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to.</v>

961
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be fair and reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my mind wants to go,</v>

962
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw he.</v>

963
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.690
<v Speaker 2>He realized that by mentioning me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

964
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:26.910
<v Speaker 2>It's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to peak curiosity with the </v>

965
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.861
<v Speaker 2>audience in which he's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think your two reasonable into </v>

966
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 2>logical in that since you're not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this redneck,</v>

967
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>he haw type character that like talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>

968
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't fit their narrative salicious</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore him because that's a trade on the</v>

969
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 2>dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it,</v>

970
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 2>but everybody was still real though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

971
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Don't have domains on all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

972
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.550
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's pretty easy to find like pro </v>

973
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 2>gun dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find quite a few of them.</v>

974
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I can pretty easy to find dummies on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side as well for sure.</v>

975
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't be looking if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that side,</v>

976
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

977
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the anti gun side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for program dummies.</v>

978
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Pro Gun dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Pro Gun dummies are easy to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are right.</v>

980
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go fucking find him on instagram</v>

981
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:13.481
<v Speaker 2>and twitter and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's dummies all over the world and </v>

982
00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:13.481
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing though,</v>

983
00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 2>the thing about what John Oliver does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing.</v>

984
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of disingenuous nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of satire and political satire.</v>

985
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the,</v>

986
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

987
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 2>the comedian plausible deniability card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

988
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can make a joke about something </v>

989
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.100
<v Speaker 2>and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

990
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 2>it has no influence because it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

991
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not saying that as he.</v>

992
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying it doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

993
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 2>What exactly he understands the </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence at wields,</v>

994
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's saying,</v>

995
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:43.330
<v Speaker 2>but he can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can always swipe the plausible </v>

996
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:43.330
<v Speaker 2>deniability card and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

997
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.541
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't making an actual political </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement like I know that there </v>

998
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:46.541
<v Speaker 2>reasonable people on the other side.</v>

999
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing a narrative that has been</v>

1000
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:51.800
<v Speaker 2>pushed for decades about an organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fights for the second amendment,</v>

1001
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

1002
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 2>the same narrative that's being pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by groups of people who say the only </v>

1003
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 2>thing standing in their way of more gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>control is the NRA.</v>

1004
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where does it to make it as power </v>

1005
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>

1006
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk out of both sides of their </v>

1007
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get the power from there.</v>

1008
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get power by their </v>

1009
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:13.810
<v Speaker 2>membership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1010
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

1011
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 2>You do your best to stifle that </v>
<v Speaker 2>membership.</v>

1012
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 2>You make it seem as unattractive as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and then you also,</v>

1013
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 2>your audience has already largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>uneducated on the issue.</v>

1014
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was already this perceived notion</v>

1015
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 2>at the Nras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a bunch of racist white rednecks.</v>

1016
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what?</v>

1017
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Then what do you do to further that </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative?</v>

1018
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:37.570
<v Speaker 2>You talk about their platform and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull out all of those things that </v>

1019
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.951
<v Speaker 2>further drive that narrative while </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoring the most popular figure on the </v>

1020
00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:41.951
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1021
00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 2>which is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so who so happens to be black.</v>

1022
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.950
<v Speaker 2>So what does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tells me that this,</v>

1023
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:53.050
<v Speaker 2>that it was deliberate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do want to agree with you and </v>

1024
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.050
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1025
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:57.910
<v Speaker 2>He's white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to be seen as attacking </v>

1026
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.910
<v Speaker 2>the black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So forth and so on.</v>

1027
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a little of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's also.</v>

1028
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 2>He's doing a show and let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1029
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Speaker 2>let me explain how the show works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a team of writers.</v>

1030
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of people back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are just trying to be funny.</v>

1031
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.490
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make points for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to find stupid shit </v>

1032
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:15.791
<v Speaker 2>that they can mock and why would they </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the guy that makes sense </v>

1033
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:16.040
<v Speaker 2>if they're looking for stupid shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they come up,</v>

1034
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:21.041
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to make a balanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable argument like maybe we would </v>

1035
00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:21.041
<v Speaker 2>do right here.</v>

1036
00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is doing a condensed,</v>

1037
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.050
<v Speaker 2>edited down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smooth,</v>

1038
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:29.230
<v Speaker 2>polished television show with that rent </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been dissected and gone over by a </v>

1039
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 2>team of writers and they have video that</v>
<v Speaker 2>corresponds it and photographs that they</v>

1040
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:35.210
<v Speaker 2>shoot go to and they have clips that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they show them.</v>

1041
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.220
<v Speaker 2>They mock the clips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a comedy show.</v>

1042
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They do have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a comedy show.</v>

1043
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they didn't go after you is </v>

1044
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 2>because maybe you're a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're articulate.</v>

1045
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you is because you're young and </v>
<v Speaker 2>black and they just don't feel like it's</v>

1046
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 2>a smart thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's because they're making a show.</v>

1047
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1048
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:59.241
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you why my panties on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruffle about it just because I </v>

1049
00:44:59.241 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 2>understand the influence of that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people make political decisions,</v>

1050
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think it's preaching to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the choir that show?</v>

1051
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

1052
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:04.200
<v Speaker 2>that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:09.201
<v Speaker 2>John Oliver show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I had to guess how many </v>

1054
00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 2>people who are watching the show are </v>
<v Speaker 2>left wing leaning,</v>

1055
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>democratic leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal leaning.</v>

1056
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a giant percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem though.</v>

1057
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 2>The number of people who come to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1058
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't deal with the NRA because </v>

1059
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 2>they're racist and there are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>white rednecks who says that?</v>

1060
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it all the time.</v>

1061
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>The evidence that they point to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just assume that they're racist.</v>

1062
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1063
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.760
<v Speaker 2>that's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in their,</v>

1064
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 2>in their attempts to just make a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1065
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.230
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with you wholeheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree with you,</v>

1066
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 2>but we can't undermine how influential </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show is at crafting people's </v>

1067
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.570
<v Speaker 2>thoughts about particular issues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies within this country.</v>

1068
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I stand back and I'm like,</v>

1069
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:56.301
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is dangerous because to meet the </v>

1070
00:45:56.301 --> 00:45:56.301
<v Speaker 2>second amendment is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1071
00:45:56.301 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the funny thing is.</v>

1072
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I thought the monologue was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Dude.</v>

1073
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Mama monologue is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give.</v>

1074
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll give him the model I'm arguing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1075
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 2>My log was funny then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't even funny dude,</v>

1076
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:12.801
<v Speaker 2>because he said that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a funny dude during that 20 </v>

1077
00:46:12.801 --> 00:46:15.351
<v Speaker 2>minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he's not to demonstrate you </v>

1078
00:46:15.351 --> 00:46:15.351
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1079
00:46:15.351 --> 00:46:16.610
<v Speaker 2>You got to demonstrate consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consistency.</v>

1080
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:21.670
<v Speaker 2>You give me some consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you drop the ball a couple </v>

1081
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.670
<v Speaker 2>times here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1082
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.910
<v Speaker 2>But as far as consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough job.</v>

1083
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Know John Oliver Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a tough job.</v>

1084
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's incredibly tough.</v>

1085
00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:31.431
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think comedians don't get enough </v>

1086
00:46:31.431 --> 00:46:31.431
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make sure it's even a real comedian.</v>

1087
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This John Oliver,</v>

1088
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:35.110
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

1089
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Is that the barometer for being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian?</v>

1090
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Stand up for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big.</v>

1091
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stand up to me,</v>

1092
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:46.701
<v Speaker 2>terrifies me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thought of ever having to keep </v>

1093
00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:49.071
<v Speaker 2>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get in front of a million people </v>

1094
00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:49.071
<v Speaker 2>and talk all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thought of Standup,</v>

1095
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.540
<v Speaker 2>see I get to quote some of my humor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriousness.</v>

1096
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's easier,</v>

1097
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do stuff here and there,</v>

1098
00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1099
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1100
00:46:55.441 --> 00:47:00.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only because it's contrasting </v>

1101
00:47:00.441 --> 00:47:00.441
<v Speaker 2>against something that's serious and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't expect to humor.</v>

1102
00:47:00.441 --> 00:47:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the way you felt before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you walked into that shooting range and </v>

1103
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:03.830
<v Speaker 2>those guns were going off and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1104
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really happening now.</v>

1105
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Think about how you feel now when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk into the range.</v>

1106
00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I go to the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I go to the range all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1108
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.480
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was rifle hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to the range least once a </v>

1109
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:17.480
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

1110
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1111
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Speaker 2>got used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

1112
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you hear the bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1113
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your headphones on.</v>

1114
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.720
<v Speaker 2>He just walk up and say hi to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you see there all the time.</v>

1115
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's super polite at the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing,</v>

1116
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:33.231
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People polite as fuck at the range </v>

1117
00:47:33.231 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 2>because everybody around you has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to kill you.</v>

1118
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>They're just not everybody around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when.</v>

1119
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in the rifle section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a 300 win mag.</v>

1120
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll blow a fucking door outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors,</v>

1121
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 2>outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1122
00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the God damn cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.460
<v Speaker 2>and everybody around you got one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things to.</v>

1124
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can kill everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

1125
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you doing?</v>

1126
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's everybody doing?</v>

1127
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Everybody super friendly but shaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

1128
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a mutual respect there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting.</v>

1129
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.860
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a weird statement that </v>

1130
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.161
<v Speaker 2>gets thrown about a lot of times that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well armed society is a polite </v>

1131
00:48:08.161 --> 00:48:08.161
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1132
00:48:08.161 --> 00:48:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were two times in my life where I </v>

1133
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 2>felt vehemently insecure the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I carried a gun out of my house and my </v>

1134
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:17.940
<v Speaker 2>first mma class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1135
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:23.010
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I was going to say is when you </v>

1136
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:26.230
<v Speaker 2>go to the gun range a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes normal comes life.</v>

1137
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what standup is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

1138
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you still can eat plates,</v>

1139
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 2>a Dick's on stage on occasion to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>south and it's terrible.</v>

1140
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst feeling good about Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking dead on and hilarious.</v>

1141
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you there?</v>

1142
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought which,</v>

1143
00:48:41.471 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 2>which bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which bit where you were basically about</v>

1144
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:48.810
<v Speaker 2>bikinis or all the Lions and tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that keep the Tigers.</v>

1145
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.600
<v Speaker 2>That shit's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically talking about we need these </v>

1146
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.301
<v Speaker 2>people without fighting wars and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have Santa Monica.</v>

1147
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:00.540
<v Speaker 2>That is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1148
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.190
<v Speaker 2>that people who've never been to Texas </v>
<v Speaker 2>do not understand.</v>

1149
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.510
<v Speaker 2>That is the America of American don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

1150
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

1151
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Texas doesn't play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the most arrogant some bitches on</v>

1152
00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also like what?</v>

1153
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:15.210
<v Speaker 2>When people think of America overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think of like these fucking crazy </v>

1154
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 2>people with guns that have jacked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks that are driving too fast.</v>

1155
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 2>The girls have big tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's a fucking crazy.</v>

1156
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what we think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Texas like this,</v>

1157
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:29.971
<v Speaker 2>not American now as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Texas is the most exaggerated form </v>

1158
00:49:29.971 --> 00:49:34.081
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas houses the most exaggerated form </v>

1159
00:49:34.081 --> 00:49:34.081
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1160
00:49:34.081 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cool people in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is way more diverse.</v>

1161
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:39.931
<v Speaker 2>People in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like super left on the Austin </v>

1162
00:49:39.931 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 2>is like California and Texas a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

1163
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a little cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's smaller,</v>

1164
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing I said about about Texas </v>

1165
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.851
<v Speaker 2>that's true is there's more tigers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>captivity in Texas than there are in all</v>

1166
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>of the wild of the world.</v>

1167
00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>More Tigers in private collections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking true,</v>

1168
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 2>and when I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1169
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:06.510
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure out a way to make this </v>

1170
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.401
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest fucking statistic I've ever </v>

1171
00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:09.740
<v Speaker 2>heard in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in people's yards.</v>

1172
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Not gonna lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up.</v>

1173
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I grew up my entire life in Texas </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to Cheetah Cheetah and they're </v>

1174
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful,</v>

1175
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just watching.</v>

1176
00:50:21.461 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is I get a cheetah and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in and put it in the yard.</v>

1177
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 2>No bigger than this room and inspect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the beauty of it running.</v>

1178
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1179
00:50:27.821 --> 00:50:32.821
<v Speaker 2>it's also fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're allowed to like </v>

1180
00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:33.410
<v Speaker 2>just feed them animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're allowed to just let</v>

1181
00:50:33.411 --> 00:50:38.411
<v Speaker 2>loose a goat and have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the Cheetah tackle the goat and </v>

1182
00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to feed them meat.</v>

1183
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1184
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 2>like already curing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to have some wild kingdom</v>

1185
00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go down in your yard.</v>

1186
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they allow them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1187
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you did say we only have three pages of </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

1188
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 2>So if it's not to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1189
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Shit about tigers ordered enough new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>order it up.</v>

1190
00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing about it is when I got </v>

1191
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.731
<v Speaker 2>into firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Texas my whole life and I </v>

1192
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 2>went 23 years without ever shooting gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>touching the gun.</v>

1193
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 2>And when I got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started the first thing I wanted to do</v>

1194
00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 2>with shoe competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1195
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And so you should competition do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

1196
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like John Wick style where you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bang,</v>

1197
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1198
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1199
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three gun,</v>

1200
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 2>they call it three guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three guns.</v>

1201
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So basically three gun consists of three</v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1202
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 2>three different platforms or rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shotgun and a handgun.</v>

1203
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:31.630
<v Speaker 2>So how does this competition work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they just set up basic set </v>

1204
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>up various courses where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilize one of those three platforms.</v>

1205
00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Some of the courses you utilize all </v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

1206
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just in there,</v>

1207
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:42.401
<v Speaker 2>you're set to a timer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to clear the courses as fast as </v>

1208
00:51:42.401 --> 00:51:42.401
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1209
00:51:42.401 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the clearing the choruses are you,</v>

1210
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.720
<v Speaker 2>is there like walls that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look behind you?</v>

1211
00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:52.820
<v Speaker 2>You're only limited by your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see that shit with Keanu </v>

1212
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>reeves was preparing for John Wick Two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>video that went viral,</v>

1216
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:03.580

<v Speaker 2>training and so I met him after the </v>

1217
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.870
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Spacey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But not in a bad way.</v>

1222
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very calm energy.</v>

1223
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Then it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't bad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a bad thing.</v>

1229
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:34.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to realize he's the matrix guy.</v>

1230
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:39.910
<v Speaker 2>That's some over the top fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit that Johnny Depp or Tom Cruise </v>

1231
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 2>level of fame and then just became this </v>
<v Speaker 2>super chill,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mellow guy that can just like go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds that kind of goes and sits on the</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:56.231
<v Speaker 2>But there's no obvious outward displays </v>
<v Speaker 2>of wealth from him and he's insanely </v>

1236
00:52:56.231 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 2>wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see him.</v>

1237
00:52:57.411 --> 00:53:02.411
<v Speaker 2>He's dressed like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got like a regular watch on and </v>

1238
00:53:02.411 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's normal as fuck man.</v>

1239
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real weird.</v>

1240
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's figured out a way to avoid like </v>

1241
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.130
<v Speaker 2>there is right there on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>subway,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1243
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:15.200

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people freak out.</v>

1245
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:17.960
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that no,</v>

1246
00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people ignore him because he's figured </v>

1247
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:24.200
<v Speaker 2>out a way to just sort of just layer in </v>
<v Speaker 2>plain sight.</v>

1248
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And then even if you talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just normal.</v>

1249
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody that I know that's met </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1250
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I said the dudes like totally look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1251
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:31.690
<v Speaker 2>He lets his chicks it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1252
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.540
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to sit down?</v>

1253
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1254
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 2>And he just stands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it,</v>

1255
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean even the ways he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no body guards,</v>

1256
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about his demeanor </v>

1257
00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and how he doesn't have this sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entitlement and I'm bringing it back,</v>

1258
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.950
<v Speaker 1>bringing it back to the gun thing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1259
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 1>The first time I carried a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1260
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:51.170
<v Speaker 1>remember I told you those are the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

1261
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.280
<v Speaker 1>the times where I felt more insecure was</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first day in mma and carrying a gun </v>

1262
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.750
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But carrying that gun for the first time</v>

1263
00:53:57.751 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 1>made me realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1264
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1265
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:07.490
<v Speaker 1>So it actually humbled me and from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint that knowing that you don't </v>

1266
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.140
<v Speaker 1>know who you're dealing with and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you carry a firearm on you,</v>

1267
00:54:10.141 --> 00:54:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to go from zero to </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 like that.</v>

1268
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you develop a respect for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1269
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:22.671
<v Speaker 1>you start to develop a respect for life </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well because you understand how </v>

1270
00:54:22.671 --> 00:54:22.671
<v Speaker 1>fragile you start to realize how fragile</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1271
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually became more docile.</v>

1272
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't get road rage because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and because I live in Texas,</v>

1273
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1274
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also know that like there's so </v>

1275
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.160
<v Speaker 1>much responsibility that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying a firearm.</v>

1276
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It's an unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1277
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:48.430
<v Speaker 1>and so for people who go out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to learn to do it and be able to </v>

1278
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.501
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a certain level of respect </v>

1279
00:54:51.501 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to have for it because it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot.</v>

1280
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:56.871
<v Speaker 1>There's certain places you can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain things you can't do things you </v>

1281
00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:56.871
<v Speaker 1>have to be cognizant of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1282
00:54:56.871 --> 00:55:01.460
<v Speaker 1>so I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually started staying away from </v>

1283
00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.771
<v Speaker 1>certain places because I knew I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun on me and I never wanted to have to </v>

1284
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:03.771
<v Speaker 1>be put in a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have to go for it.</v>

1285
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you wear a gun all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I can do it legally?</v>

1286
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>

1287
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:08.440
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And what is the idea behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like it's better to have it not </v>

1289
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 2>to need it than to need it not to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1290
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1292
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different.</v>

1293
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It's literally just a part of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>routine.</v>

1294
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch keys,</v>

1295
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallet,</v>

1296
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the chamber or no one in the </v>

1297
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:26.031
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and yeah,</v>

1298
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 1>safety on chambered the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually carry doesn't,</v>

1299
00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:30.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't have external safeties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I,</v>

1300
00:55:30.741 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I carry in the holster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you carry the holster it shouldn't</v>

1301
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 1>be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1302
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1303
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 1>So you just want to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really ready.</v>

1304
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well see he don't want to have to know </v>

1305
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1306
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's progressive.</v>

1307
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't always like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started off not caring with one in the</v>

1308
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:51.561
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just start putting one </v>

1309
00:55:51.561 --> 00:55:53.991
<v Speaker 1>in the chamber?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started understanding and </v>

1310
00:55:53.991 --> 00:55:55.581
<v Speaker 1>trusting the mechanics of a firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I started caring I knew </v>

1311
00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 1>about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't trust the mechanics.</v>

1312
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1313
00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extra step,</v>

1314
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like it's necessary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1315
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.180
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1316
00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like having A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1317
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1318
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1319
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And started training with the guns in </v>
<v Speaker 1>self defense and stuff like that.</v>

1320
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1321
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 1>so the gun isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't an end all,</v>

1322
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:22.431
<v Speaker 1>be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a tool that I carry with me </v>

1323
00:56:22.431 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly save my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still dog with a gun</v>

1324
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.910
<v Speaker 2>on me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1325
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd started weighing the </v>

1326
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>disadvantages and the advantages of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having one in the chamber.</v>

1327
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might find myself in a situation </v>

1328
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.150
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1329
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.150
<v Speaker 2>what I have time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1330
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm behind here and I have time to rack </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and do what I need to do.</v>

1331
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:45.330
<v Speaker 2>There may be other times where I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I already have a round in the </v>

1332
00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.901
<v Speaker 2>chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those times where I will have the time </v>

1333
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and not have the time won't make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference because there's already one </v>

1334
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:51.630
<v Speaker 2>of the chamber ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1336
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 2>as I got more comfortable with the gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and realize,</v>

1337
00:56:56.471 --> 00:57:01.471
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gun never just went off on its own </v>

1338
00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:01.471
<v Speaker 2>because it was an inherent fear there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1339
00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want the gun to go off while I</v>

1340
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 2>was in your pants.</v>

1341
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.900
<v Speaker 2>You have like one of them Chi decks </v>
<v Speaker 2>holsters.</v>

1342
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 2>It's form fitted gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1343
00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I have tons of holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a box for the holster show you </v>

1344
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 2>because I reviewed guns and review and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gear and stuff,</v>

1345
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.471
<v Speaker 2>so I'm constantly switching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a gift and a curse because you </v>

1346
00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:19.731
<v Speaker 2>know I never perfect any platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can you put any pretty much any </v>

1347
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 2>gun in my hand I can use decently now </v>
<v Speaker 2>when things happen,</v>

1348
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.790
<v Speaker 2>whenever there's a mass shooting or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1349
00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 2>immediately people want to blame gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>owners or people that want to protect </v>

1350
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:34.090
<v Speaker 2>gun owners and specifically NRA members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This comes down on you.</v>

1351
00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:39.091
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's always a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes down to people that want guns </v>

1352
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:46.770
<v Speaker 2>and the people that don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations and don't want additional </v>

1353
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:46.770
<v Speaker 2>screening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

1354
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've got to think about it.</v>

1355
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:51.130
<v Speaker 2>So like the figureheads when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you started talking about Wayne and</v>

1356
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 2>there people go after them clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also you have the personalities</v>

1357
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 2>of the brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is me,</v>

1358
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Dana and Dana.</v>

1359
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana last,</v>

1360
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an official spokesperson.</v>

1361
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very nice lady.</v>

1362
00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I met her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1363
00:58:05.661 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 2>And then you have mentorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cam Edwards,</v>

1364
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1365
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:13.561
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what tends to happen is I get it </v>

1366
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:15.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot via social because that's how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>built my brand.</v>

1367
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I built my brand through social and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people will when they can't </v>

1368
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.561
<v Speaker 2>descend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think Wayne Lapierre has a </v>

1369
00:58:25.561 --> 00:58:25.561
<v Speaker 2>twitter page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1370
00:58:25.561 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have an instagram account so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably in a bunker somewhere.</v>

1371
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:34.310
<v Speaker 2>He's not counting ammo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More noble than I believe you.</v>

1372
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Well you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you are is an interesting version </v>

1373
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.850
<v Speaker 2>of the NRA is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is the NRA too.</v>

1374
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a kind of a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's multifaceted.</v>

1375
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I dare anyone to go to the NRA annual </v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings and then if you can,</v>

1376
00:58:51.581 --> 00:58:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how secluded is.</v>

1377
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Go to the board meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a dinner meetings.</v>

1378
00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:00.480
<v Speaker 2>You'll be surprised they'll have I every</v>
<v Speaker 2>race you can think of different </v>

1379
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:00.480
<v Speaker 2>sexualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You name it.</v>

1380
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in the NRA forever.</v>

1381
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:07.321
<v Speaker 2>I just admired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let my membership lapse like a year and </v>

1382
00:59:07.321 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 2>a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was in the NRA because I just felt</v>

1383
00:59:09.101 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 2>like I know people that are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get rid of the guns.</v>

1384
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1385
00:59:14.171 --> 00:59:19.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to stop </v>

1386
00:59:19.171 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I ask people this all the time.</v>

1387
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I've done it on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the big red button question,</v>

1388
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1389
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>So he put a big red button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd asked him if I put a big red button </v>

1390
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you push this button,</v>

1391
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.490
<v Speaker 1>all the guns on the planet disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do it?</v>

1392
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll get various answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't do it.</v>

1393
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1394
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you not be the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence?</v>

1395
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the end of defense.</v>

1396
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're talking about </v>

1397
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:43.900
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can't,</v>

1398
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.860
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are we going to fight with </v>

1399
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:47.860
<v Speaker 2>swords and bows and arrows and shit.</v>

1400
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the interesting thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too is a lot of people are either </v>

1401
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:51.370
<v Speaker 1>side will say they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1402
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 1>The same people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you need an Ar 15?</v>

1403
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And then in an inverse when I say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second Amendment is actually not about </v>

1404
00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:01.871
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about defending ourselves from a </v>

1405
01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:01.871
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic or foreign.</v>

1406
01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:01.871
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1407
01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you think you little stupid guns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to defend against the,</v>

1408
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>against the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1409
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>well then why don't you give me the guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government has done?</v>

1410
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And then they get quiet because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized the contradiction in what </v>

1411
01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they're stating.</v>

1412
01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the government.</v>

1413
01:00:15.271 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>When you say the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like protect us against the government,</v>

1414
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:21.150
<v Speaker 2>we are the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government's filled with people like</v>

1415
01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.340
<v Speaker 2>the cops are us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

1416
01:00:23.341 --> 01:00:25.920
<v Speaker 2>is this separation of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you gave me a red button,</v>

1417
01:00:25.921 --> 01:00:30.921
<v Speaker 2>said would I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could I end all senseless violence by </v>

1418
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:31.260
<v Speaker 2>hitting that button?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say yes.</v>

1419
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And then when people say it's a gun's </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1420
01:00:32.941 --> 01:00:37.941
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know that London Past New York </v>

1421
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:38.460
<v Speaker 2>City for the first time since 1800 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>homicides,</v>

1422
01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:43.580
<v Speaker 2>and they did it with fucking nice with </v>
<v Speaker 2>knives to the point where that goofball </v>

1423
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.070
<v Speaker 2>mayor of London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Dork on his twitter page said,</v>

1424
01:00:47.071 --> 01:00:52.071
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to carry a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get caught carrying a knife,</v>

1425
01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you will be prosecuted under the fullest</v>
<v Speaker 2>extent of the law.</v>

1426
01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:57.840
<v Speaker 2>This is the fucking knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've got a knife.</v>

1427
01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh I don't have it on me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a knife on me all the time.</v>

1428
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It's the same country that the utilizes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shining example of what we should be</v>

1429
01:01:04.021 --> 01:01:05.400
<v Speaker 2>doing in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1430
01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:08.040
<v Speaker 2>And they have more murders in London </v>
<v Speaker 2>from knives.</v>

1431
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:09.660
<v Speaker 2>And here's the funny thing about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1432
01:01:09.661 --> 01:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know like in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have an uptake and acid attacks.</v>

1433
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd rather be shot.</v>

1434
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that acid.</v>

1435
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a thing that people are doing to </v>

1436
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>ex wives and shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1437
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.910
<v Speaker 2>that's ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is that is dark.</v>

1438
01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.350
<v Speaker 2>That is some human shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also will all of this stuff,</v>

1439
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 2>it comes down to like what makes a fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed person instead of looking at </v>

1440
01:01:33.751 --> 01:01:38.751
<v Speaker 2>what's available to a fully developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and what would allow fully </v>

1441
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>developed person to commit horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes.</v>

1442
01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>What turns a person into that we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be looking at it from the root to the </v>

1443
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 2>fully grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the process that allow </v>

1444
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:54.041
<v Speaker 2>someone to become a mass shooter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the process that allow them to </v>

1445
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:54.041
<v Speaker 2>throw acid in someone's face?</v>

1446
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Because I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1447
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I clearly have to frame everything to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because I know what the </v>

1448
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like even for me,</v>

1449
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>like I said it in video before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever had to pull my gun and shoot </v>

1450
01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>someone to take a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>

1451
01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to need therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1452
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because because I value life that much.</v>

1453
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I value it.</v>

1454
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have children?</v>

1455
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:12.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1456
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1457
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.310
<v Speaker 2>If he had kids and some guy was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hurt your daughter and he shot him,</v>

1458
01:02:17.311 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd sleep like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

1459
01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.940
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting you say that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to women about firearm </v>

1460
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:24.940
<v Speaker 2>ownership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1461
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.330
<v Speaker 2>like none of the girls know girls I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been in a relationship with were </v>

1462
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:29.330
<v Speaker 2>like pro gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1463
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 2>But over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1464
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>dealing with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you walk into my house and </v>

1465
01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>there's five rifles on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of just have to get acclimated.</v>

1466
01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But in dealing with women who started </v>
<v Speaker 2>off initially as anti,</v>

1467
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them talk about not wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns because they can't see themselves </v>

1468
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.481
<v Speaker 2>taking the life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the moment I asked them would they </v>

1469
01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:47.481
<v Speaker 2>take a life to protect a child?</v>

1470
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm blowing that sucker away,</v>

1471
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting how that works.</v>

1472
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:52.510
<v Speaker 2>How we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1473
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be the same way to a child and you </v>

1474
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:03.291
<v Speaker 2>know that whatever it is that turns a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child into some monster there,</v>

1475
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but school,</v>

1476
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>examined.</v>

1477
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

1478
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not a part of the discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's bringing it up.</v>

1479
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 2>All people bring up is the event </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1480
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 2>the gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we need to keep.</v>

1481
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:20.151
<v Speaker 2>Keep the tools away from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think the tools are one part of </v>

1482
01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think that you should.</v>

1483
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>If there was a way we should figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to keep psychopaths from owning </v>

1484
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.401
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you determine whether or not </v>

1485
01:03:31.401 --> 01:03:31.401
<v Speaker 2>someone's a psychopath so they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something psychopathic?</v>

1486
01:03:31.401 --> 01:03:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then someone will talk about,</v>

1487
01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Australia,</v>

1488
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:34.880
<v Speaker 2>they had one mass shooting in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>

1489
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 2>They took all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 18 people in Australia.</v>

1490
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>It's as big as the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's less people.</v>

1491
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention crime went up after they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did that,</v>

1492
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:47.510
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bottling crime went up when they did </v>

1493
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:49.251
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people don't want to talk </v>

1494
01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:49.251
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in your right,</v>

1495
01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 2>like people forget context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like two people in Australia.</v>

1496
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.710
<v Speaker 2>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about this one town in Georgia were</v>

1497
01:03:55.711 --> 01:04:00.711
<v Speaker 2>firearm ownership is mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember hearing it and they made </v>

1498
01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 2>it mandatory and violent crime and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything dropped radically.</v>

1499
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Break Ins dropped radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made it mandatory.</v>

1500
01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody was like,</v>

1501
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 2>fuck a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it.</v>

1502
01:04:09.901 --> 01:04:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I need to find a new way to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living because most dudes like,</v>

1503
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.370
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most dudes who engaged in crime,</v>

1504
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1505
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Like of course you have your Sickos who </v>
<v Speaker 2>just loved the violence,</v>

1506
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them just crimes of opportunity.</v>

1507
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.310
<v Speaker 2>So they're looking for victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for easy victims,</v>

1508
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:26.580
<v Speaker 2>easy targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to deal with someone who</v>

1509
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 2>possibly is going to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to die.</v>

1510
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Which is why you've seen a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos with these home invasions where </v>

1511
01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you watch when the actual homeowner has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a firearm.</v>

1512
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Once the shot start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the bullets start flying,</v>

1513
01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taken off.</v>

1514
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so.</v>

1515
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:46.230
<v Speaker 2>It always boggles my mind when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>

1516
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need a gun for this,</v>

1517
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>or you don't need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1518
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1519
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1520
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.640
<v Speaker 2>the chances of you ever needing it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it,</v>

1521
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly moronic.</v>

1522
01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Sure this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chances are you've gone through life </v>

1523
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.250
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however old you are,</v>

1524
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.830
<v Speaker 2>when I'm talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't been shot.</v>

1525
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 2>So the chances are 100 percent that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't need it.</v>

1526
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean you won't need any</v>

1527
01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 2>crazy conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the conversation should be</v>

1528
01:05:10.321 --> 01:05:15.321
<v Speaker 2>about the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think the conversation should </v>

1529
01:05:15.321 --> 01:05:15.321
<v Speaker 2>be about what makes a person capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

1530
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the conversation is what makes a </v>

1531
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:22.340
<v Speaker 2>person's such a fucking nut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have so many guns that they </v>

1532
01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:22.340
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1533
01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you have so many guns you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how many have is that bad?</v>

1534
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seemed like a reasonable guy.</v>

1535
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then I can only use one gonna </v>

1536
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have two hands.</v>

1537
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is like,</v>

1538
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>what if someone breaks in your house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>steals your guns?</v>

1539
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you haven't been a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody breaks in your house and</v>

1540
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>steals your gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1541
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1542
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that somebody wants to break the law</v>

1543
01:05:39.141 --> 01:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>and breaking into my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1544
01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>The idea is like access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're giving access.</v>

1545
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you eliminate limited.</v>

1546
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very different.</v>

1547
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1548
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:51.511
<v Speaker 2>But you still live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that fundamentally goes back to the </v>

1549
01:05:51.511 --> 01:05:53.851
<v Speaker 2>idea that people want to undervalue this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a constitutional right,</v>

1550
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1551
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what we ended up,</v>

1552
01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>we find ourselves doing is finding ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>to limit that ripe because of the few </v>

1553
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 2>bad people in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:09.451
<v Speaker 2>and I just think that's the wrong way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go about it because we're basically </v>

1555
01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:13.590
<v Speaker 2>evolving ourselves down to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to have any rights left </v>

1556
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:14.410
<v Speaker 2>because there are a couple of bad people</v>
<v Speaker 2>here who might do something bad with the</v>

1557
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:19.411
<v Speaker 2>rights that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the wrong way to go about </v>

1558
01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:19.411
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>

1559
01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:19.411
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

1560
01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 2>if we had no violence in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something happened,</v>

1561
01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:26.701
<v Speaker 2>human beings evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If our switch changed and there's no </v>

1562
01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:29.290
<v Speaker 2>more violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you still want to have guns?</v>

1563
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to happen for recreation </v>

1564
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:35.640
<v Speaker 2>because you enjoy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something people don't want to </v>

1566
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:38.820
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've never shot a gun,</v>

1568
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:43.540
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever gone to a gun range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should probably should because it is</v>

1569
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.280
<v Speaker 2>actually fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1570
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Now if you do that activity and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about hurting someone and </v>

1571
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 2>all you're thinking about is focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the target,</v>

1572
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 2>trigger control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

1573
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1574
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>we do it.</v>

1575
01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Do anything on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it athletic shooting.</v>

1576
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my background before I got into guns </v>

1577
01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>was sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the basketball,</v>

1578
01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran cross country track,</v>

1579
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I got a gun,</v>

1580
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:14.050
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dream was to go to the Mba when I was</v>

1581
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1582
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm clearly that didn't happen and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to.</v>

1583
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:24.240
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was at that athleticism still in </v>

1584
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.691
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we did on the show when we were </v>

1585
01:07:27.691 --> 01:07:29.911
<v Speaker 1>talking about coming up with a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting competition was how do I </v>

1586
01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:29.911
<v Speaker 1>incorporate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it,</v>

1587
01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:34.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I incorporate some of the </v>

1588
01:07:34.081 --> 01:07:34.081
<v Speaker 1>athletic athleticism into shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1589
01:07:34.081 --> 01:07:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially by and large a lot </v>

1590
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 1>of running and just shooting a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>position and so forth and so on.</v>

1591
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And so when we're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know thinking about shooting a person </v>

1592
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that's not the type of shooting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1593
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>doing target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doing target shooting with some </v>

1594
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>athleticism involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1595
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and people undervalue that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's kind of like how can you not </v>

1596
01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>see that these are other ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>firearms are used it,</v>

1597
01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>which is why I started my brand new pew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pew Life,</v>

1598
01:07:58.410 --> 01:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

1599
01:07:59.491 --> 01:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

1600
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:03.570
<v Speaker 2>predicated around the EWP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ewp for people who don't understand that</v>

1601
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.960
<v Speaker 2>people who use guns like exact firearm </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>

1602
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag Po Po.</v>

1603
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Because mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it when we were kids was </v>

1604
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>also simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1605
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like cops and robbers with gun pew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pew,</v>

1606
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Pew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pew,</v>

1607
01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1608
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>but then so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1609
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to capture the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recreation involved in playing cops </v>

1610
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.551
<v Speaker 1>and robbers as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also understanding the very </v>

1611
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>definitive and distinction between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good guys and bad guys,</v>

1612
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who live this lifestyle are good </v>

1613
01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:33.840
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy guns for recreation,</v>

1614
01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>they also understand that we live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where not everybody is good,</v>

1615
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we also own guns for our own self </v>

1616
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.651
<v Speaker 1>defense and so it's this culmination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this lifestyle that comes together and </v>

1617
01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>we appreciate guns in a way that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think is perverse,</v>

1618
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1619
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but how is it any less?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it any different than me </v>

1620
01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 1>obsessing over the Aston Martin DB?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1621
01:08:53.871 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>For the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that perverse.</v>

1622
01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a mechanical item.</v>

1623
01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The potential for violence is what,</v>

1624
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.120
<v Speaker 1>what scares people and if they mean when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy kills 86 people nice with the </v>

1625
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>truck right now.</v>

1626
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a very good point and no </v>

1627
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>one's trying out outlaw trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1628
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's this thing that we have in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country where we have more guns than we </v>

1629
01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:23.921
<v Speaker 1>have human beings and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that disturbs people yet because they </v>

1630
01:09:23.921 --> 01:09:26.260
<v Speaker 1>inherently vilify the firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I have another Hashtag that</v>

1631
01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I call still waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still waiting for what?</v>

1632
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Still waiting for my gun to jump up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own and kill somebody.</v>

1633
01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1634
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is relatively tongue in cheek,</v>

1635
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time what it does is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>transfers to focus.</v>

1636
01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a drunk driver gets behind,</v>

1637
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 1>gets behind the wheel and kill someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't blame the vehicle for it.</v>

1638
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.490
<v Speaker 1>We blame the driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1639
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.550
<v Speaker 1>So when somebody goes out and commits </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence with the firearm,</v>

1640
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.120
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we focusing on the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing good instead of focusing on </v>

1641
01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the firearm?</v>

1642
01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should certainly be focusing </v>

1643
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.641
<v Speaker 1>on the people as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should certainly be focused on </v>

1644
01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:04.030
<v Speaker 1>focusing on what happens to a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes them develop into the type of</v>

1645
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:08.780
<v Speaker 1>person that can go into a movie theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoot it up like the rural Colorado.</v>

1646
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that conversation and we don't </v>

1647
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>have honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going,</v>

1648
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of several things.</v>

1649
01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:18.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the easy answer for me is to say is it's</v>

1650
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.670
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1651
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.750
<v Speaker 1>We maybe have a culture that facilitates</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or you know,</v>

1652
01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:26.680
<v Speaker 1>we have situation where there are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do flip between the cracks.</v>

1653
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.060
<v Speaker 1>No one pays attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly some of that.</v>

1654
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And I do think there is a lack of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1655
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to everybody you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then also I think there's,</v>

1656
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 1>like I was raised by a single parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

1657
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1658
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And My mother over compensated when </v>
<v Speaker 1>raising me because she understood the </v>

1659
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:45.980
<v Speaker 1>limitations of her being a woman raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young man.</v>

1660
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was unnecessarily hard on me.</v>

1661
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.360
<v Speaker 1>My mom has zero tolerance for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

1662
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 1>absolutely zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she taught me growing up was how</v>

1663
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>to deal with adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me how to deal with failure,</v>

1664
01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>how to get past those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me how to be self assured.</v>

1665
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And so what I think we're lacking to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in this country is people not </v>

1666
01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 1>having the coping mechanisms to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with failure or to deal with rejection,</v>

1667
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1668
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>so I'm getting worse than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1669
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

1670
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 2>was definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely people that feel like</v>

1671
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:20.811
<v Speaker 2>they're outsiders and they want to flip </v>
<v Speaker 2>the board over there losing the game and</v>

1672
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:26.211
<v Speaker 2>they just want to flip the board over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems like that Parkland kid </v>

1673
01:11:26.211 --> 01:11:30.510
<v Speaker 2>mean there were kids that were worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him before this ever happened and </v>

1674
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:34.641
<v Speaker 2>that his whole thing was that his life </v>
<v Speaker 2>was shit and he wanted other people to </v>

1675
01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 2>experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1676
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is is like the hard thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it too is not a realizing that </v>

1677
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.321
<v Speaker 2>just came to my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes I don't even want to </v>

1678
01:11:45.321 --> 01:11:48.321
<v Speaker 2>talk about the mental health aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in this particular case with the </v>

1679
01:11:48.321 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 2>parking street because I just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relegate them to evil.</v>

1680
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1681
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Because it pisses me off like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking innocent lives because you</v>

1682
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:57.120
<v Speaker 2>feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go in a corner and shoot yourself.</v>

1683
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:02.420
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a romanticized version of that </v>

1684
01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people just want to take everybody</v>

1685
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:07.791
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take all the people out that you saw </v>

1686
01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:07.791
<v Speaker 2>that were doing well while you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling.</v>

1687
01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 2>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in,</v>

1688
01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:13.221
<v Speaker 2>but the world always flips and flips if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good attitude and you're a </v>

1689
01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:16.290
<v Speaker 2>healthy person like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're mentally ill and your life</v>

1690
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:21.291
<v Speaker 2>has been just tormented and abuse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health issues and you're all </v>

1691
01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1692
01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the answer is,</v>

1693
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:32.691
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that the problem lies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individuals that are capable of </v>

1694
01:12:32.691 --> 01:12:34.050
<v Speaker 2>committing that and how did they become </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1695
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Because you've got to make a great point</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you got the mindset that you have </v>

1696
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.130
<v Speaker 2>to be in a walk down the school hall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shoot people,</v>

1697
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 2>shoot kids to shoot him.</v>

1698
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It just innocently just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking.</v>

1699
01:12:45.421 --> 01:12:46.520
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's sandy hook or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any one of these things like you have to</v>

1701
01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:55.431
<v Speaker 2>be fucked up to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as and how many people are running </v>

1702
01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:56.580
<v Speaker 2>around that are like three quarters </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

1703
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 2>You only need a few bad things to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong in relatively speaking.</v>

1704
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:05.241
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 300 plus million people in this </v>

1705
01:13:05.241 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are relatively relatively few </v>

1706
01:13:08.241 --> 01:13:11.271
<v Speaker 2>people that they are capable and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually act on such terrific have a </v>

1707
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:16.550
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think can be done to </v>

1708
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 2>stop this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about it?</v>

1709
01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it all the time.</v>

1710
01:13:19.141 --> 01:13:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1711
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a harder question for me to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to come up with ways of why we </v>

1712
01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:24.710
<v Speaker 2>don't need gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1713
01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:25.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>

1714
01:13:25.111 --> 01:13:26.280
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1715
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:26.730
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1716
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Especially when I'm taking gun control </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the table because people are always </v>

1717
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:32.540
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1718
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.200
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't want to move one inch.</v>

1719
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 2>When I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1720
01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:36.900
<v Speaker 2>because we'd been moving in Itch for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last 20,</v>

1721
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:38.550
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it's a,</v>

1722
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucked up argument because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are holding the guns are not</v>

1723
01:13:43.681 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

1724
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.390
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1725
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:51.400
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to attack the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of gun owners are not </v>

1726
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:53.900
<v Speaker 2>committing crimes with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

1727
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 2>So when I think about what can we do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

1728
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:58.440
<v Speaker 2>it's different types of shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

1729
01:13:58.441 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 2>let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with the.</v>

1730
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with what types of shootings</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened the most gang violence,</v>

1731
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the statistics,</v>

1732
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:09.720
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

1733
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Americans' war zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1734
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>30,000</v>

1735
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>people a year die in an eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the vast majority of it that is </v>

1736
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>remaining is actual homicides is gang </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

1737
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:22.500
<v Speaker 1>So then we have a gang problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have a gang problem in this </v>

1738
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.291
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a socioeconomic problem in very </v>

1739
01:14:25.291 --> 01:14:25.400
<v Speaker 1>specific areas in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1740
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I just came from south side </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago where I started in high park </v>

1741
01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:35.370
<v Speaker 1>where Obama used to live and enjoy a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes into an area that looked like a </v>

1742
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:39.331
<v Speaker 1>bomb went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the violence in high </v>

1743
01:14:39.331 --> 01:14:42.481
<v Speaker 1>park that they had in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they had the same access to illegal </v>

1744
01:14:42.481 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same problem because</v>

1745
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:49.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference in economics and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one wants to do well.</v>

1746
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to address that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1747
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.680
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a kid growing up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and I'm going to a school </v>

1748
01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1749
01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:55.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a damn about me.</v>

1750
01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I looked up and was able to go to good </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

1751
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to schools where my teachers </v>

1752
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.001
<v Speaker 1>cared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to schools where teachers pushed </v>

1753
01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 1>me when I was slacking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1754
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I had the ability to take out loans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a good law school.</v>

1755
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:12.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had those abilities.</v>

1756
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:17.101
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a kid growing up in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and I can't find refuge in </v>

1757
01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:22.201
<v Speaker 1>my school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find refuge at home because my </v>

1758
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:22.201
<v Speaker 1>mom's working three or four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

1759
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 1>so she's never there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going to go find parents?</v>

1760
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I going to find that parental </v>

1761
01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.060
<v Speaker 1>influence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna find on the streets.</v>

1762
01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.660
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm on the streets being led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who grew up in the exact </v>

1763
01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 1>conditions that I grew up in and so now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1764
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I have to make money.</v>

1765
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.270
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do for money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1766
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>then there's the Naco economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very conveniently right there for me,</v>

1767
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So drugs.</v>

1768
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying on the corner selling </v>

1769
01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to protect my product,</v>

1770
01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:47.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>

1771
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.630
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna take it from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do I do?</v>

1772
01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I get a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I carry a gun.</v>

1773
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm stuck in the true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop,</v>

1774
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that feeds on itself,</v>

1775
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm stuck defending myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the guy who shooting at me,</v>

1776
01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>back at him.</v>

1777
01:16:03.581 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not because I'm trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>your stuff,</v>

1778
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but because he's trying to take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1779
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you get that violence </v>

1780
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>that comes from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from those particular areas.</v>

1781
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we would have sat back and said,</v>

1782
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:17.821
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have hyper concentrated areas in this</v>

1783
01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a widespread.</v>

1784
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It's hyper concentrated communities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country that are dealing with this,</v>

1785
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 1>that are also the result of the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of our gun violence.</v>

1786
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.100
<v Speaker 1>If we sat back and thought about it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a socioeconomic standpoint,</v>

1787
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 1>how do we fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

1788
01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:37.411
<v Speaker 1>How do we present opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying go there and just hand </v>

1789
01:16:37.411 --> 01:16:40.491
<v Speaker 1>out stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we fix this from the </v>

1790
01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 1>standpoint of improving our schools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that can drive five minutes,</v>

1791
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:45.210
<v Speaker 1>one direction and have a school that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can name and then driving</v>

1792
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>into driving the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The school has can barely have textbooks</v>

1793
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 1>to give to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

1794
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we focusing our energy on </v>

1795
01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:56.830
<v Speaker 1>building data up versus talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1796
01:16:56.831 --> 01:16:59.140
<v Speaker 1>we need to get the guns off the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did that.</v>

1797
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You had that in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have every gun law imaginable in </v>

1798
01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just outside Chicago still looks the</v>

1799
01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 1>way that it does still as a violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it does.</v>

1800
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we would,</v>

1801
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.920
<v Speaker 1>if we provide,</v>

1802
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:15.700
<v Speaker 2>when you give people something lose or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lift for they don't throw away life </v>

1803
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.360
<v Speaker 2>so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plain and simple.</v>

1804
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So if my social economic status is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dirt,</v>

1805
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>another kid down the street and shooting</v>

1806
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:27.740
<v Speaker 2>at him and taking his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything.</v>

1807
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we were to focus our attention </v>

1808
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:37.121
<v Speaker 2>and fixing that same way we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mental health issue with respect to </v>

1809
01:17:37.121 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 2>mass shootings and school shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have to worry about the guns</v>

1810
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:44.531
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have people wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do those things or have the capability </v>

1811
01:17:44.531 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 2>to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1812
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:49.220
<v Speaker 2>So then that deals with that vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of the violence that we had.</v>

1813
01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:52.190
<v Speaker 2>They're focusing that energy in fixing </v>
<v Speaker 2>those communities.</v>

1814
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this many,</v>

1815
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:59.681
<v Speaker 2>many times in the show that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to make America a better </v>

1816
01:17:59.681 --> 01:18:01.100
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best ways to do it is to make</v>

1817
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:03.380
<v Speaker 2>it easier for someone to succeed.</v>

1818
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Make it easy and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stop pretending that it's a level </v>

1819
01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.111
<v Speaker 2>playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't grow up in a level </v>

1820
01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:11.111
<v Speaker 2>playing field and I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>

1821
01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:15.461
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go to somewhere like the </v>

1822
01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 2>south side of Chicago and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that you got lucky,</v>

1823
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1824
01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you're blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1825
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.960
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want them.</v>

1826
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:22.190
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way to make America </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger?</v>

1827
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Less losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less people who lose their how did,</v>

1828
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 2>how has that will give them more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance,</v>

1829
01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.570
<v Speaker 2>give them more of an opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>give them guidance,</v>

1830
01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:32.390
<v Speaker 2>ship community centers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean up the streets,</v>

1831
01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.540
<v Speaker 2>fixed buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot of fucking money that </v>

1832
01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.151
<v Speaker 2>we're spending right now in Afghanistan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Iraq and missiles and all kinds of </v>

1833
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:42.410
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit that we're not putting any </v>
<v Speaker 2>money into that.</v>

1834
01:18:42.411 --> 01:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>But then who do we hold accountable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

1835
01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:49.780
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we like when we talk about the inner </v>

1836
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:49.780
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1837
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.080
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had been democratically run for </v>

1838
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:53.540
<v Speaker 2>ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the local leadership,</v>

1839
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 2>there's democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1840
01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>But there's no money there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there's the money's going</v>

1841
01:18:57.621 --> 01:18:59.160
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I me look at Chicago,</v>

1842
01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 2>just not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1843
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:05.531
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money's going into the areas where </v>

1844
01:19:05.531 --> 01:19:05.531
<v Speaker 2>people are wealthy and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supporting.</v>

1845
01:19:05.531 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 2>They're not supporting these </v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished areas.</v>

1846
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:09.020
<v Speaker 2>And then you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>

1847
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:15.220
<v Speaker 2>So if that's the case and we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that and you know that stop </v>

1848
01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:15.220
<v Speaker 2>selling this bullshit about gun control </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1849
01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.830
<v Speaker 2>but let's just tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just one,</v>

1850
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:19.910
<v Speaker 2>one aspect to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1851
01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>

1852
01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:27.460
<v Speaker 2>in when it comes to gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex when it comes to gang </v>

1853
01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.151
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex and I agree with you </v>

1854
01:19:31.151 --> 01:19:31.151
<v Speaker 2>that they need.</v>

1855
01:19:31.151 --> 01:19:34.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to stop that then </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix the inner cities where people are</v>

1856
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 2>just in that cycle of constant poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crime and that's all they see around</v>

1857
01:19:39.891 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes normalized.</v>

1858
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1859
01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now let's talk about mass shootings.</v>

1860
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1861
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So get rid of gun free zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to hear that.</v>

1862
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of gun free zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not going to establish a </v>

1863
01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.550
<v Speaker 2>perimeter outside of a building where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go,</v>

1864
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:00.770
<v Speaker 2>don't tell me I can't bring my gun in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1865
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>A sign on the window is not stopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody from coming into the building.</v>

1866
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 2>We've seen it time and time and time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>time again.</v>

1867
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 2>If the guns were the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have mass shooting at every gun</v>

1868
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:14.250
<v Speaker 2>show every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we don't.</v>

1869
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Why the same reason you pointed out why </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one,</v>

1870
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 2>that one place in Georgia when they said</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody had to have a gun,</v>

1871
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:21.240
<v Speaker 2>crime went down.</v>

1872
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to hear that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to hear that.</v>

1873
01:20:24.261 --> 01:20:27.530
<v Speaker 2>The answer to gun violence is everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a gun.</v>

1874
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not such a convenient answer for a guy </v>

1875
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>like you as very convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many guns can't count.</v>

1876
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the alternative.</v>

1877
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.020
<v Speaker 2>We've been living in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1878
01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that there's a problem.</v>

1879
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 2>So why are we entertaining in the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe that is the case,</v>

1880
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:49.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that like school </v>

1881
01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:51.171
<v Speaker 2>shootings for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that these teachers being </v>

1882
01:20:51.171 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 2>armed would be the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1883
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.550
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think there should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed security on the campus?</v>

1884
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I say it should be multilayered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1885
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to put things into </v>

1886
01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:04.830
<v Speaker 2>perspective and the NRA didn't add about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and people got pissed off,</v>

1887
01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's the truth.</v>

1888
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Wherever whatever school the president's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids go to,</v>

1889
01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.450
<v Speaker 2>they are guarded by guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1890
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.570
<v Speaker 2>At school was protected by guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1891
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Anything we hold valuable in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country is protected with guns.</v>

1892
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:25.010
<v Speaker 2>No one is more anti gun than Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hear about any sort of crime or</v>

1893
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:32.901
<v Speaker 2>gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wing people in Hollywood are </v>

1894
01:21:32.901 --> 01:21:36.921
<v Speaker 2>the most vocal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most virtue signaling the quickest </v>

1895
01:21:36.921 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 2>to jump on their pedestal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1896
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of their fucking movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>involve gun violence?</v>

1897
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the Academy Awards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the security at the Academy </v>

1898
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Awards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see all these left leaning liberal </v>

1899
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:55.400
<v Speaker 2>actors being protected by people of flak</v>
<v Speaker 2>jackets on carrying guns with fingers </v>

1900
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 2>outside the triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean dogs,</v>

1901
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1902
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:03.930
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a loss of touch with reality.</v>

1903
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are also insulated and protected.</v>

1904
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:09.720
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it because in their mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>their mindset goes like this.</v>

1905
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have security guards.</v>

1906
01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashians,</v>

1907
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 2>the biggest.</v>

1908
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I did a video on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did.</v>

1909
01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.950
<v Speaker 2>That was the first thing that came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegas.</v>

1910
01:22:19.951 --> 01:22:22.110
<v Speaker 2>What she biggest hypocrite on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1911
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Because she's a dumb dumb of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's.</v>

1912
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:30.081
<v Speaker 2>She also influences a ton of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unfortunate.</v>

1913
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 2>But exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Harvey hat or on family feud,</v>

1914
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:38.390
<v Speaker 2>they were on family feud that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kardashians the whether we're talking </v>

1915
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:39.720
<v Speaker 2>about how fucking stupid kid was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know this though.</v>

1916
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no incentive for her to be </v>

1917
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't.</v>

1918
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's good at making money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just show.</v>

1919
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1920
01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.680
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't fault her for that.</v>

1921
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you money.</v>

1922
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:51.420
<v Speaker 2>But we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1923
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:56.600
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still,</v>

1924
01:22:56.670 --> 01:23:00.220
<v Speaker 2>she still has access to scores of young </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential rides.</v>

1925
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unfortunate,</v>

1926
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:03.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing we can do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1927
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but other than you point out the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's</v>

1928
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>a dumb dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

1929
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not terrible person.</v>

1931
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1932
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

1933
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I've heard her talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think she's really </v>

1934
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 1>interested in expanding your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that that's something</v>

1935
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:22.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not benefits booklets her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though.</v>

1936
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:28.380
<v Speaker 1>The mindset though is there are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who we paid to carry guns,</v>

1937
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to carry them.</v>

1938
01:23:31.331 --> 01:23:36.331
<v Speaker 1>Therefore you don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying about her is that </v>

1939
01:23:36.331 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 1>she is anti gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she talks about being anti gun,</v>

1940
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 1>yet she's constantly surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have guns.</v>

1941
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolute fact.</v>

1942
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 1>So you cancel this fact so then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't turn around and tell me that.</v>

1943
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need a firearm.</v>

1944
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course you don't pitch seven foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills</v>

1945
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 1>all around you.</v>

1946
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1947
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1948
01:23:55.190 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's man.</v>

1949
01:23:57.371 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It's frustrating because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1950
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have eight dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing out here with Ar,</v>

1951
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>15 slung over their shoulders ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect me at have given notice where I </v>

1952
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>could afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pay for it,</v>

1953
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:13.610
<v Speaker 1>not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing is I still carry a gun </v>

1954
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.610
<v Speaker 1>on me because I can't always be exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I am.</v>

1955
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1956
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a paranoid way to live though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1957
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 1>What difference does it make you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

1958
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:21.040
<v Speaker 1>How much does it affect me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wake up everyday,</v>

1959
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:26.041
<v Speaker 1>put a gun on my hip and go out and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same thing I would do if I </v>

1960
01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:26.041
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't think about it.</v>

1961
01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:26.290
<v Speaker 1>So in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>

1962
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're not paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paranoid.</v>

1963
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

1964
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1965
01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.160
<v Speaker 1>no more paranoid than any than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that has a fire extinguisher in </v>

1966
01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:35.160
<v Speaker 1>their house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

1967
01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I don't walk around like,</v>

1968
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

1969
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's coming to get me?</v>

1970
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:40.830
<v Speaker 1>That's paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1971
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.840
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm doing is being prepared right </v>

1972
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:45.840
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be levels of preparedness.</v>

1973
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You start to get hit diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>returns.</v>

1974
01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Where starts to be in like it starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take away from your quality of life,</v>

1975
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.160
<v Speaker 1>but me putting a gun on my hip and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going about my business that doesn't </v>

1976
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.340
<v Speaker 1>interfere with my life enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1977
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1978
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:03.211
<v Speaker 1>It's funny what you said about humility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you like more calm and relaxed </v>

1979
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 1>since you've been involved with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens with Jujitsu.</v>

1980
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts training in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jujitsu in particular because you </v>

1981
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.110
<v Speaker 1>get strangled so much.</v>

1982
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:15.760
<v Speaker 1>My neck hurts right now because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling with a guy just before I came up</v>

1983
01:25:15.761 --> 01:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>like last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1984
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it man,</v>

1985
01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 1>it's such a beautiful sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

1986
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but it also lets you know your place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the food chain,</v>

1987
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:29.440
<v Speaker 1>especially when you first start out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to realize you really honestly</v>

1988
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>can't call out an elite human until it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>

1989
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.070
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I started,</v>

1990
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>before I started really kind of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>into mma,</v>

1991
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:44.161
<v Speaker 1>so forth and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I could spot out the guy you </v>

1992
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:44.161
<v Speaker 1>don't want to mess with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1993
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:45.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1994
01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to class and then he </v>

1995
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>knew my coach started pairing me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people and I'm like,</v>

1996
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:56.940
<v Speaker 1>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was seeing this dude was just </v>

1997
01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:56.940
<v Speaker 1>walking down the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1998
01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:56.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can handle him.</v>

1999
01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm rolled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pretzel was nuts in my face.</v>

2000
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Narrowed assassins assassins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2001
01:26:03.141 --> 01:26:04.030
<v Speaker 1>At Tenth Planet we've</v>

2002
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:06.830
<v Speaker 2>got a whole army of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would still a computer dorks,</v>

2003
01:26:06.831 --> 01:26:08.140
<v Speaker 2>no kill you with their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2004
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.850
<v Speaker 2>The wrap their legs around your neck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>choke you to sleep,</v>

2005
01:26:10.851 --> 01:26:12.360
<v Speaker 2>but you can't even stop it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

2006
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing man.</v>

2007
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:18.761
<v Speaker 2>And then my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I always get stuck and I'm going to </v>

2008
01:26:18.761 --> 01:26:18.761
<v Speaker 2>overpower him and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2009
01:26:18.761 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you better off being week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>

2010
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>the best Jujitsu is weak man's Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>

2011
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:27.551
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to learn Jiu Jitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning from a small guy because you </v>

2012
01:26:27.551 --> 01:26:27.551
<v Speaker 2>learn from a small guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2013
01:26:27.551 --> 01:26:29.350
<v Speaker 2>They've never been able to cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning they never been able to.</v>

2014
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I've always had to have perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

2015
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.130
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2016
01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally you have to have some strength</v>

2017
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:42.340
<v Speaker 2>for sure and strength with technique is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate but perfect technique is </v>

2018
01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.580
<v Speaker 2>where it's at and you get that from like</v>
<v Speaker 2>little guys like Barrett Yoshida,</v>

2019
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heuler grace of the smaller guys are the</v>

2020
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:53.030
<v Speaker 2>ones that you want to learn from because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never been the big guy.</v>

2021
01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.110
<v Speaker 2>The big guys are like top game guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smash past guys.</v>

2022
01:26:57.111 --> 01:27:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were just relying on </v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower and leg strength and shit.</v>

2023
01:27:00.171 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way to learn,</v>

2024
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to learn is to go around things.</v>

2025
01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2026
01:27:06.541 --> 01:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing about that is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know why I started doing it?</v>

2027
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Why someone said would if there took </v>
<v Speaker 2>your gun away,</v>

2028
01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one said that.</v>

2029
01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I said it to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

2030
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:16.340
<v Speaker 2>So to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't,</v>

2031
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I almost thought I was over dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because when remember the gun is a </v>

2032
01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:21.970
<v Speaker 2>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She carried a knife too.</v>

2035
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this weird space where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my jeans are kind of sorted a little too</v>

2036
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 2>tight and not so they're not quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny jeans,</v>

2037
01:27:33.441 --> 01:27:36.010

<v Speaker 2>point I have too much stuff going on in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I write all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the videos I do.</v>

2069
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I write them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you write them in?</v>

2070
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.040
<v Speaker 2>They put them on a teleprompter or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you practice it?</v>

2071
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it straight off the tops and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and teleprompter.</v>

2072
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:44.350
<v Speaker 2>It just depends what we feel is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give the communicate the best to what </v>

2073
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.350
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2074
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:45.010
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

2075
01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.150
<v Speaker 2>it shows work ethic for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2076
01:28:47.151 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a life,</v>

2077
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

2078
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.030
<v Speaker 2>All I do is work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out and eat.</v>

2079
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.290
<v Speaker 2>So is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these videos?</v>

2080
01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Is this your tired life now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the most part,</v>

2081
01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:01.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in terms of your occupation?</v>

2082
01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:02.940
<v Speaker 2>So you don't work as a lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2083
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I do a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have things with a small firm in</v>

2084
01:29:05.581 --> 01:29:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2085
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.990
<v Speaker 2>and then so other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just other investments and things that </v>

2086
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:11.990
<v Speaker 2>have gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

2087
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 2>So you're able to make a living off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these videos.</v>

2088
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 2>There was a time when you could do it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube anymore?</v>

2089
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real recent.</v>

2090
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Within the last six or seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually a gun guy started noticing</v>

2091
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:26.430
<v Speaker 2>that drop a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm talking about.</v>

2092
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:31.730
<v Speaker 2>We went from like to like half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And then now it's like 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that happened,</v>

2094
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that happened like a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2095
01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And how does that work in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they pick certain videos that are </v>

2096
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.461
<v Speaker 2>just not eligible for monetizations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have known before it was just a </v>

2097
01:29:46.461 --> 01:29:48.760
<v Speaker 2>drop in organic reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just started like it wasn't,</v>

2098
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't anything formal.</v>

2099
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:55.110
<v Speaker 2>At least that's what I picked up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I started noticing.</v>

2100
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

2101
01:29:56.070 --> 01:30:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't living off the youtube </v>

2102
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.070
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

2103
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kept my income cut in half.</v>

2104
01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:30:05.101 --> 01:30:10.101
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been some people that have </v>

2106
01:30:10.101 --> 01:30:12.350
<v Speaker 2>investigated this and there's been some </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside sources have told people that </v>

2107
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:14.940
<v Speaker 2>they actively target conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun owners,</v>

2108
01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:16.230
<v Speaker 2>redneck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it on twitter.</v>

2109
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 2>They do it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different places.</v>

2110
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2111
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.780
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's that guy?</v>

2112
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:27.770
<v Speaker 2>American provider Guy that did those </v>
<v Speaker 2>undercover investigative reports.</v>

2113
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He sent a bunch of people into like bars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk to twitter engineers.</v>

2114
01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm talking about.</v>

2115
01:30:39.721 --> 01:30:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I will say this though,</v>

2116
01:30:41.251 --> 01:30:46.251
<v Speaker 2>there are so like there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in these places that are </v>

2117
01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may not even agree with my stance,</v>

2118
01:30:46.951 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to them and they'll help</v>
<v Speaker 2>me out the best that they can.</v>

2119
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people on facebook,</v>

2120
01:30:50.731 --> 01:30:54.030
<v Speaker 2>some people youtube so and so on because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all those individuals,</v>

2121
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:59.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the column column go support is in a </v>

2122
01:30:59.031 --> 01:31:00.180
<v Speaker 2>sense because you know they can be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicit about the,</v>

2123
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2124
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:03.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have just a complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniform,</v>

2125
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:08.001
<v Speaker 2>left wing ideology at any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations are going to be some </v>

2126
01:31:08.001 --> 01:31:11.061
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they get stuck in these group think </v>

2127
01:31:11.061 --> 01:31:13.170
<v Speaker 2>environments like Google or wherever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is and they can't speak out.</v>

2128
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Which is unfortunate because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't this country?</v>

2129
01:31:16.141 --> 01:31:21.141
<v Speaker 2>This country was founded on the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having having a release,</v>

2130
01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:26.070
<v Speaker 2>undercover footage of twitter employees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and employees,</v>

2131
01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:31.730
<v Speaker 2>engineers and employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitting that twitter employees view </v>

2132
01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:35.121
<v Speaker 2>everything you post on their servers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including private sex messages and Dick </v>

2133
01:31:35.121 --> 01:31:35.780
<v Speaker 2>pics because that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't send them.</v>

2134
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen engineers also admit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that twitter analyzes this information </v>

2135
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:44.230
<v Speaker 2>to create a virtual profile of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they sell to advertisers.</v>

2136
01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:49.250
<v Speaker 2>James O'keefe has completed the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the series entitled American </v>

2137
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:53.271
<v Speaker 2>provider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fight for the truth in the era of </v>

2138
01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:53.271
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:56.930
<v Speaker 2>So this guy has sent a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to like engineers and I've seen </v>

2140
01:31:57.661 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>the videos where they're explaining how</v>

2141
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 1>they a dog a rhythm and how they make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that these people don't even know </v>

2142
01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>that people can't see their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tweets or give it all the time.</v>

2143
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:08.800
<v Speaker 1>People to send it to me all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2144
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2145
01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason youtube is forcing me to</v>

2146
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>unfollow you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like thought I followed you,</v>

2147
01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:19.621
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm not following you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of that's paranoia and </v>

2148
01:32:19.621 --> 01:32:19.621
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is,</v>

2149
01:32:19.621 --> 01:32:20.490
<v Speaker 1>some of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2150
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 1>but it still begs the question because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers don't lie.</v>

2151
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2152
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I know with facebook there was times I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was reaching millions of people but just</v>

2153
01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>to post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that got cut in half.</v>

2154
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 1>But largely that was due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetization,</v>

2155
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that was before facebook was monetizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

2156
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted to cotton now there they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to pay to get access to your </v>

2157
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.590
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

2158
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You get what I'm saying so that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

2159
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like some deep secret kind of </v>

2160
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2161
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to stifle your reach because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in it's now there may be some of</v>

2162
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 1>that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2163
01:32:52.211 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 1>So I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

2164
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.550
<v Speaker 1>like I buy ads for my merchandise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell on facebook,</v>

2165
01:32:57.551 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I just post a picture of it,</v>

2166
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.260
<v Speaker 1>my entire artist doesn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2167
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And so somebody went through facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just deleted all of our ads,</v>

2168
01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.330
<v Speaker 1>like especially toward money on ads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just delete,</v>

2169
01:33:10.331 --> 01:33:15.331
<v Speaker 1>disapproved them out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I called the contact and </v>

2170
01:33:15.331 --> 01:33:15.331
<v Speaker 1>then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2171
01:33:15.331 --> 01:33:19.951
<v Speaker 1>that should've happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it went back and put it back </v>

2172
01:33:19.951 --> 01:33:19.951
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes it's even individualized,</v>

2173
01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an individual who disagrees </v>

2174
01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:25.020
<v Speaker 1>with everything you stand for.</v>

2175
01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Who has the power to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you remember when that guy did that</v>

2176
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:28.540
<v Speaker 1>with trump is disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is twitter really did it for a couple of</v>

2177
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.590
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2178
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely people that have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of power and they abuse it.</v>

2179
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that everywhere.</v>

2180
01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:39.040
<v Speaker 1>You see that with moderators on message </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>

2181
01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:44.041
<v Speaker 1>You see that with every time people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power than you and they go,</v>

2182
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy talking about his guns.</v>

2183
01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just yank them.</v>

2184
01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:55.020
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't complain about it on my </v>

2185
01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 1>platform at all because no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:33:56.350 --> 01:34:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube started taking off taking like </v>

2187
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:04.501
<v Speaker 1>demonetizing my videos for ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it and a lot of people were </v>

2188
01:34:04.501 --> 01:34:04.501
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2189
01:34:04.501 --> 01:34:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't like those ads anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do realize I have to pay to get this</v>

2190
01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 1>stuff done.</v>

2191
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2192
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Well no one seems to care until it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and affects them because they don't </v>

2193
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 1>realize that essentially what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is they're,</v>

2194
01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.880
<v Speaker 1>they're censoring you by diminishing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money that you can make.</v>

2195
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2196
01:34:22.611 --> 01:34:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say it's not real censorship,</v>

2197
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but it is censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2198
01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much what I'm dealing with </v>

2199
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>

2200
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 1>right now my videos don't come out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>

2201
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I do good reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm known for my gun reviews.</v>

2202
01:34:33.341 --> 01:34:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I liked my grandmother used to be </v>

2203
01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:38.341
<v Speaker 1>very cinematic voiceover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put thought into them.</v>

2204
01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I write scripts out from my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is too now before where I </v>

2205
01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>could afford to hire someone to edit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2206
01:34:45.190 --> 01:34:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I can't write and I need that now more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever because now on the political </v>

2207
01:34:50.190 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 1>front of the things I'm running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling.</v>

2208
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was having my Mac book with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2209
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I have to try to find places where I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to edit a little bit and get things </v>

2210
01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:57.720
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the same people who were like,</v>

2211
01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>we don't care about</v>

2212
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.100
<v Speaker 2>the ads on your videos and you make your</v>
<v Speaker 2>money from your,</v>

2213
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:05.140
<v Speaker 2>from your videos are saint people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you making videos as much as </v>

2214
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you used to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2215
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2216
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the money to pay someone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>edit the videos in order to keep pumping</v>

2217
01:35:07.971 --> 01:35:12.971
<v Speaker 2>them out the way I was doing it before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to give you some sub </v>

2218
01:35:12.971 --> 01:35:12.971
<v Speaker 2>quality crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2219
01:35:12.971 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I could just toss a video together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just throw it out there.</v>

2220
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't listen to all those people </v>

2221
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 2>that are complaining and asking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2222
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 2>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really.</v>

2223
01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube rather is fucking up because </v>

2224
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.221
<v Speaker 2>they're opening up the door to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitor that is really invested in </v>

2225
01:35:30.221 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

2226
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

2227
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are at the.</v>

2228
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 2>They are at the mercy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisers.</v>

2229
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.790
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know people over at Youtube,</v>

2230
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:44.350
<v Speaker 2>they are deciding what they want said </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not Sacha,</v>

2231
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 2>and this is how I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought up Jordan Peterson,</v>

2232
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>this woman that worked at huge fan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she said he's a troublemaker,</v>

2233
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is he a troublemaker?</v>

2234
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:57.550
<v Speaker 2>She had no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She radical left wing but not </v>

2235
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.550
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2236
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:58.160
<v Speaker 2>not thoughtful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she.</v>

2237
01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:00.450
<v Speaker 2>She'd just have a good argument for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you did,</v>

2238
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 2>when you pushed back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's used to being the boss at work.</v>

2239
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:07.880
<v Speaker 2>She's used to just dismissing you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was pushing back with her like,</v>

2240
01:36:07.881 --> 01:36:08.870
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

2241
01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he a troublemaker?</v>

2242
01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you're telling me what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic,</v>

2243
01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:13.520
<v Speaker 2>but what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no answer to that,</v>

2244
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:18.550
<v Speaker 2>but yet able to dismissively say </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's a troublemaker when they're a </v>

2245
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:22.241
<v Speaker 2>very highly respected intellectual that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has amazing points about a lot of </v>

2246
01:36:22.241 --> 01:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>different things that resonates with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of very,</v>

2247
01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:23.810
<v Speaker 2>very smart people.</v>

2248
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the nature of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very bright guy in a,</v>

2249
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:29.120
<v Speaker 2>in a really good human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you meet him,</v>

2250
01:36:29.121 --> 01:36:34.121
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for someone just say he's a </v>

2251
01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:34.121
<v Speaker 2>troublemaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like okay,</v>

2252
01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:38.970
<v Speaker 2>no because he doesn't agree with you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's causing trouble with your </v>

2253
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:42.731
<v Speaker 2>organization because you're censoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's views and viewpoints and it's </v>

2254
01:36:42.731 --> 01:36:46.190
<v Speaker 2>so convenient to read the label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone all right or you know,</v>

2255
01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:48.980
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're dealing with today.</v>

2256
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 2>There's these hate identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It drives me insane.</v>

2257
01:36:52.521 --> 01:36:55.040
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how many people flocked to it</v>

2258
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:57.950
<v Speaker 2>too because it's intellectually easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>varies.</v>

2259
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can sit there and then you just re </v>

2260
01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.820
<v Speaker 2>just regurgitate all of the talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>points that you have.</v>

2261
01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 2>This is why I don't do well on cable </v>
<v Speaker 2>news hits because what ends up happening</v>

2262
01:37:09.771 --> 01:37:12.770
<v Speaker 2>is like on this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I intellectualize it,</v>

2263
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2264
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Like the conversation we're having now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I get the benefit.</v>

2265
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I love this because we could sit here if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to think about something.</v>

2266
01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:21.410
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

2267
01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me think about that for a little </v>

2268
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:26.640
<v Speaker 2>like on cable news and you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2269
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did this kind of platforms,</v>

2270
01:37:27.471 --> 01:37:30.410
<v Speaker 2>the best platform because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation is never interrupted.</v>

2271
01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.230
<v Speaker 2>He never stopped for ads and no one can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell someone to.</v>

2272
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here you go ahead,</v>

2273
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:37.490
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry we could wrap this up soon,</v>

2274
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wanted to get to other than not</v>

2275
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:44.130
<v Speaker 2>having gun free zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean not having everyone armed to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth and.</v>

2277
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2278
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

2279
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying if you're going to have gun</v>

2280
01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:54.740
<v Speaker 2>free zones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them real gun gun free zones.</v>

2281
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't just put a sticker on the</v>

2282
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 1>window and then say you can't bring your</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun in here and then not have physical </v>

2283
01:38:01.051 --> 01:38:06.051
<v Speaker 1>measures in place to prevent it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I'm allowed to prevent it to </v>

2284
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.300
<v Speaker 1>have like some movie theater or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2285
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.730
<v Speaker 1>If you have a movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them.</v>

2286
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:10.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it a gun free zone.</v>

2287
01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Have a metal detector and the metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>detector goes off.</v>

2288
01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You're still fucking guns in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you gonna do you have armed</v>

2289
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:18.450
<v Speaker 1>guards to keep people from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then.</v>

2290
01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 1>So then don't make it a gun free zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2291
01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you don't mean,</v>

2292
01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you have a gun free zone and you </v>

2293
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 1>have a movie theater and you put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal detectors on,</v>

2294
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 1>the only way to enforce that is to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

2295
01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to hire,</v>

2297
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:36.180
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hire armed guard to stand</v>

2298
01:38:36.181 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2299
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.560
<v Speaker 1>With the metal detectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the metal detectors are only </v>

2300
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:42.560
<v Speaker 1>as good as the person being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce it.</v>

2301
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to.</v>

2302
01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 1>We need the executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2303
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.250
<v Speaker 1>So that would be an armed guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2304
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we think about it though.</v>

2305
01:38:48.331 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>We do it at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2306
01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:55.230
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it at certain nightclubs when I </v>

2307
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:55.230
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not admitting to go into strip clubs</v>

2308
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:56.130
<v Speaker 1>where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go to strip club,</v>

2309
01:38:56.131 --> 01:38:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I get patted down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guard there.</v>

2310
01:38:57.721 --> 01:38:59.520
<v Speaker 1>There's usually three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three guys there with guns.</v>

2311
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't.</v>

2312
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Besides the people they let in who </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have them anyway,</v>

2313
01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:06.450
<v Speaker 1>she just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be cracks.</v>

2314
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2315
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:12.310
<v Speaker 1>But at at least if you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a gun free zone,</v>

2316
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 1>put up the physical preventative </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures to reinforce that.</v>

2317
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:17.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't just.</v>

2318
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just don't sticker on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window and say this is a gun free </v>

2319
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:26.001
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only people who are going to obey </v>

2320
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:26.001
<v Speaker 1>that or the people you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about anyway.</v>

2321
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about movie theaters,</v>

2322
01:39:26.341 --> 01:39:28.860
<v Speaker 1>there's movie theaters don't even say </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a gun free zone.</v>

2323
01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:33.000
<v Speaker 1>When do they say there's some movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters?</v>

2324
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Is it state to state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>

2325
01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:39.210
<v Speaker 1>like in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where um,</v>

2326
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.370
<v Speaker 1>there are some movie theaters where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can bring my gun in.</v>

2327
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:43.250
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other movie theaters that have</v>

2328
01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:45.660
<v Speaker 1>these signs that say you're not allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to carry a gun in here.</v>

2329
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it is state to state.</v>

2330
01:39:47.671 --> 01:39:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Some states they just require you to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a sign,</v>

2331
01:39:50.091 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 1>like it's business to business to it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely is.</v>

2332
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2333
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:59.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like even the courthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when I go to the courthouse </v>

2334
01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:00.510
<v Speaker 1>courthouse was a gun free zone minus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact if you were a cop.</v>

2335
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.400
<v Speaker 1>But what do you have to do when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the courthouse?</v>

2336
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You go through metal detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were cops,</v>

2337
01:40:04.111 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 1>there were people there with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about schools?</v>

2338
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like these guys that are </v>

2339
01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:13.670
<v Speaker 1>showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even,</v>

2340
01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:14.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not even students to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2341
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Like Mr Glenn Hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it like this though it.</v>

2342
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:22.680
<v Speaker 1>This is where the argument gets really </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous because it's like,</v>

2343
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:27.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to save our kids lives in </v>

2344
01:40:27.681 --> 01:40:27.681
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2345
01:40:27.681 --> 01:40:30.300
<v Speaker 1>so the inner cities have more violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we can think of.</v>

2346
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of shootings that go on </v>

2347
01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.310
<v Speaker 1>outside of the schools in their cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the last time you heard a mass </v>

2348
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.310
<v Speaker 1>shooting in the inner city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2349
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:38.370
<v Speaker 1>very rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely.</v>

2350
01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 1>If not ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the one thing that they all have?</v>

2351
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Metal detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2352
01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:47.460
<v Speaker 1>What's the one thing that Parkland </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have?</v>

2353
01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Metal detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the one thing that a lot of these</v>

2354
01:40:50.351 --> 01:40:53.320
<v Speaker 1>suburban schools that get shot up don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have metal detectors?</v>

2355
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2356
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>found too,</v>

2357
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a very strange sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

2358
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but when you deal with places that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of violence,</v>

2359
01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 1>when you deal with places that have gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence and crime,</v>

2360
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:13.470
<v Speaker 1>which you don't have in those places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the random mass shootings.</v>

2361
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>You have one on one crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one arm,</v>

2362
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:21.481
<v Speaker 1>but the tangible reality of actual gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence for whatever reason,</v>

2363
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.840
<v Speaker 1>sort of eliminates these mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mass shootings tend to occur in </v>

2364
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:30.080
<v Speaker 1>places where people think they're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2365
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like schools,</v>

2366
01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:33.440
<v Speaker 1>movie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just,</v>

2367
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:36.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a different dynamic involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2368
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna become more of an unknown </v>

2369
01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:44.921
<v Speaker 1>because if you compare the violence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner city to volunteer the suburbs </v>

2370
01:41:44.921 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 1>which present themselves and by way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings,</v>

2371
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:51.060
<v Speaker 1>if you compare the numbers as a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings account for statistics </v>

2372
01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.120
<v Speaker 1>for about one to two percent of all gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

2373
01:41:52.121 --> 01:41:52.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2374
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does exceedingly higher number of </v>

2375
01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:58.730
<v Speaker 1>percentage of gun violence in inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

2376
01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it all really goes back down to what</v>

2377
01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's by the economics.</v>

2378
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So you have a situation in the suburb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburban areas where economically </v>

2379
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:07.800
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good,</v>

2380
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:07.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2381
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's not really an incentive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just engage in random violence.</v>

2382
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a narco economy there that </v>

2383
01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that feeds on itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires you to engage in a certain</v>

2384
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 1>level of violence in order to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas on the other hand,</v>

2385
01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 1>in the inner cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have that dynamic.</v>

2386
01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.440
<v Speaker 1>So from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening though,</v>

2387
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.050
<v Speaker 1>even though there was an money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't everything,</v>

2388
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:32.070
<v Speaker 1>money doesn't care it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're still gonna have instances of </v>

2389
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:35.401
<v Speaker 1>people who slipped through the cracks </v>
<v Speaker 1>because money doesn't cure everything </v>

2390
01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and so when it does happen to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in these random acts of mass </v>

2391
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 1>shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2392
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Whereas here there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I know I'm going to school and I'm </v>

2393
01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:51.091
<v Speaker 1>going to have to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to inevitably deal </v>

2394
01:42:51.091 --> 01:42:51.091
<v Speaker 1>with the violence outside of the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2395
01:42:51.091 --> 01:42:53.470
<v Speaker 1>It almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost makes it unnecessary to engage</v>

2396
01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 1>in random acts of mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

2397
01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.820
<v Speaker 1>it's almost kind of like this perverted </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction from,</v>

2398
01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.940
<v Speaker 1>from wanting to shoot a place up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with violence on an </v>

2399
01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 1>ongoing basis every single day of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2400
01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what their point was.</v>

2401
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 1>The point was that when violence is real</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's around you all the time.</v>

2402
01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2403
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't become this attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blow up the game.</v>

2404
01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go take a leak and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll wrap this up and I'll get back.</v>

2405
01:43:17.981 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm young.</v>

2406
01:43:20.681 --> 01:43:22.810
<v Speaker 1>James is going to show me his collection</v>
<v Speaker 1>of guns while you're gone.</v>

2407
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Carries one in his pants at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strapped right next to his deck.</v>

2408
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'd ever carry a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carry.</v>

2409
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what if like what if someone came </v>

2410
01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:41.191
<v Speaker 1>in here and got us licensed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>concealed carry and said young Jamie,</v>

2411
01:43:41.441 --> 01:43:46.441
<v Speaker 1>you need to be strapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is fill out this </v>

2412
01:43:46.441 --> 01:43:46.441
<v Speaker 1>paperwork and I'm going to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

2413
01:43:46.441 --> 01:43:47.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't personally feel.</v>

2414
01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2415
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's also naivety or </v>

2416
01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:53.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever that I don't feel the need</v>

2417
01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:53.610
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2418
01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 2>most of the time you wouldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do it.</v>

2419
01:43:55.570 --> 01:43:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2420
01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were at a place like,</v>

2421
01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>

2422
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>whenever one of these things has gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a nightclub,</v>

2423
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:09.220
<v Speaker 2>let's say that gay nightclub in Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're curious and you're walking </v>

2424
01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:12.631
<v Speaker 2>around with the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love about Batman the night it came </v>

2425
01:44:12.631 --> 01:44:12.631
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:44:12.631 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>How about the Batman one or there wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>a one,</v>

2427
01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.310
<v Speaker 2>an Amy Schumer movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

2428
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:16.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a mass shooting,</v>

2429
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an amy schumer movie,</v>

2430
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:24.490
<v Speaker 2>one of our movies because she became </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this big anti-gun advocate </v>

2431
01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:25.560
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2432
01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.540
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that you would ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>find yourself in a situation where you'd</v>

2433
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 2>want a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2434
01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:33.170
<v Speaker 2>after that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2435
01:44:33.171 --> 01:44:38.171
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to movies and pictured it </v>

2436
01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:40.091
<v Speaker 2>happening and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just think about what you would do </v>

2437
01:44:40.091 --> 01:44:44.170
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know that pulling out a gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and firing back is even in my conscious </v>

2438
01:44:44.391 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

2439
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:49.830
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely in the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the guy has a gun and he's in the </v>

2440
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:53.441
<v Speaker 2>room and you see one guy shooting people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're there and he's not shot you </v>

2441
01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely in the option.</v>

2442
01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I suppose so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2443
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it depends on how long you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>

2444
01:44:56.841 --> 01:45:01.841
<v Speaker 2>If it's also whether or not you can keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit together while someone </v>

2445
01:45:01.841 --> 01:45:01.841
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2446
01:45:01.841 --> 01:45:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean keeping your shit together while </v>
<v Speaker 2>while guns are going off and.</v>

2447
01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:09.660
<v Speaker 2>But that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a normal thing for you and </v>

2448
01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:11.300
<v Speaker 2>the amount of adrenaline will be pumping</v>
<v Speaker 2>through your body.</v>

2449
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:16.450
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about if you were in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where a mass shooting was </v>

2450
01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:16.450
<v Speaker 2>going down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that think they can just pull</v>

2451
01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 2>out their gun and shoot that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might fucking hit random people.</v>

2452
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:21.830
<v Speaker 2>You might hit the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might hit the ceiling.</v>

2453
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about.</v>

2454
01:45:23.690 --> 01:45:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of experience in archery </v>

2455
01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:32.560
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people when they're shooting a live </v>

2456
01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:32.560
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they panic.</v>

2457
01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 2>A big fucking moose walks in and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might hit that moves in the Dick.</v>

2458
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.740
<v Speaker 2>You might not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even things as big as a building and you</v>

2459
01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:41.540
<v Speaker 2>might miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2460
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time.</v>

2461
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Twenty yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People missed the entire animal.</v>

2462
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's not even </v>

2463
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:53.561
<v Speaker 2>going to fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a Moose for the vegas </v>

2464
01:45:53.561 --> 01:45:53.561
<v Speaker 2>shooting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I any,</v>

2465
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:54.410
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2466
01:45:54.411 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>witness reports and anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

2467
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even video reports,</v>

2468
01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:00.980
<v Speaker 2>there's such a chaotic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday night.</v>

2469
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2470
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:03.900
<v Speaker 2>So wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2471
01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:06.110
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea?</v>

2472
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also one of those things too,</v>

2473
01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:13.001
<v Speaker 2>whereas it's real problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories because one of the </v>

2474
01:46:13.001 --> 01:46:16.241
<v Speaker 2>things that happen out of the Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation was people would show up at </v>

2475
01:46:16.241 --> 01:46:17.750
<v Speaker 2>all these different casinos and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's shooting.</v>

2476
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So they would say were the security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go,</v>

2477
01:46:20.271 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 2>there's an active shooter at circus </v>
<v Speaker 2>circus.</v>

2478
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:25.040
<v Speaker 2>There's an active shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the conspiracy theories were like,</v>

2479
01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:26.600
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooters everywhere.</v>

2480
01:46:26.601 --> 01:46:31.601
<v Speaker 2>There were shootings everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there was people everywhere that </v>

2481
01:46:31.601 --> 01:46:34.051
<v Speaker 2>were freaking out because this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy was just gunning people down from a </v>

2482
01:46:34.051 --> 01:46:35.480
<v Speaker 2>hotel room when they haven't learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being a lawyer.</v>

2483
01:46:35.481 --> 01:46:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Eye witness testimony is not reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eye witness testimony is dog shit,</v>

2484
01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people tell me about situations</v>

2485
01:46:41.691 --> 01:46:43.870
<v Speaker 2>where I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

2486
01:46:43.890 --> 01:46:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2487
01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:49.301
<v Speaker 2>that is not what fucking happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to go over it with </v>

2488
01:46:49.301 --> 01:46:49.301
<v Speaker 2>them and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2489
01:46:49.301 --> 01:46:49.301
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2490
01:46:49.301 --> 01:46:54.110
<v Speaker 2>This though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People stopping mass shootings with </v>

2491
01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:55.260
<v Speaker 2>firearms happens more than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it does happen,</v>

2492
01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's just what happens is it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>disingenuous to deny it happens.</v>

2493
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:05.030
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stories out there where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happened and people don't know </v>

2494
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>about it because they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to push it.</v>

2495
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
<v Speaker 2>So you think the elimination of gun free</v>
<v Speaker 2>zones would be the way to protect </v>

2496
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

2497
01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:13.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to clear it.</v>

2498
01:47:13.190 --> 01:47:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cleaned up a little bit.</v>

2499
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.880
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to have a gun free zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have physical preventative measures in </v>

2500
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:19.880
<v Speaker 2>order to enrich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enforce it.</v>

2501
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're not going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate them.</v>

2502
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I think they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first and foremost,</v>

2503
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 2>this will be the first thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>

2504
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:32.390
<v Speaker 2>There should be some sort of a public </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing on the use of Ssri </v>

2505
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:38.420
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psych medications and their </v>

2506
01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.940
<v Speaker 2>corresponding instances like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2507
01:47:39.941 --> 01:47:44.941
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of instances where these </v>

2508
01:47:44.941 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 2>shooters are on these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are aware.</v>

2509
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To piggyback off what you're saying,</v>

2510
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.360
<v Speaker 2>if I was diagnosed with a mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

2511
01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I first thing I would do is I would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bookstore or go online and figure </v>

2512
01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:01.671
<v Speaker 2>out every possible way that I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help my way through it because I won't </v>

2513
01:48:01.671 --> 01:48:01.671
<v Speaker 2>touch the stuff.</v>

2514
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's just as </v>

2515
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.211
<v Speaker 2>effective if not more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Google this cardio,</v>

2516
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I think exercise and running is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective to treat depression than ssrs.</v>

2517
01:48:14.590 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I am almost certain that's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the case.</v>

2518
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't doubt it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2519
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I think or you think so many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to marathons?</v>

2520
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2521
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get high.</v>

2522
01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something to it,</v>

2523
01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get high when I run for sure.</v>

2524
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I go to the official site </v>

2525
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:33.990
<v Speaker 2>that says it's not a real thing whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood official sense?</v>

2526
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:36.420
<v Speaker 2>CBI Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the NCBI?</v>

2527
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:41.530
<v Speaker 2>The like where they did a study on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is exercise a viable treatment for </v>

2528
01:48:41.530 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 2>depression or they want to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get pilled up,</v>

2529
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:48.380
<v Speaker 2>but there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are studies that have been done </v>

2530
01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 2>that show because I know Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrick was discussing it.</v>

2531
01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I have to be freaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate taking medicine like I have to be</v>

2532
01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:58.101
<v Speaker 2>on the floor before take prescribing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise before medication.</v>

2533
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:03.770
<v Speaker 2>A real big activity is shown to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective treatment for many forms of </v>

2534
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:07.011
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are so many people still on </v>

2535
01:49:07.011 --> 01:49:07.011
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2536
01:49:07.011 --> 01:49:10.371
<v Speaker 2>here's one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not to dismiss the people </v>

2537
01:49:10.371 --> 01:49:13.551
<v Speaker 2>that are depressed because I know people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are depressed and it's a horrible </v>

2538
01:49:13.551 --> 01:49:13.590
<v Speaker 2>thing and I know people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>helped by antidepressants.</v>

2539
01:49:13.591 --> 01:49:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have my good friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray.</v>

2540
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 2>He was suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got on antidepressants.</v>

2541
01:49:18.601 --> 01:49:19.380
<v Speaker 2>He's happiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2542
01:49:19.381 --> 01:49:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Now he's off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helped him.</v>

2543
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.700
<v Speaker 2>My friend Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the same thing,</v>

2544
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.500
<v Speaker 2>not the Brian that we know another </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2545
01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:28.620
<v Speaker 2>he was a Jujitsu guy that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a real fucking problem,</v>

2546
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 2>got on Ssri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned his life around,</v>

2547
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:34.230
<v Speaker 2>found a good woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got got an a great relationship.</v>

2548
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.780
<v Speaker 2>It started his own business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaned himself off of him.</v>

2549
01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:41.781
<v Speaker 2>Now he's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's sometimes people find ruts in </v>

2550
01:49:41.781 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a podcast with a guy wrote a book</v>

2551
01:49:43.411 --> 01:49:44.820
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Guy Johann Hari,</v>

2552
01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 2>who wrote a book on depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ssri for depression,</v>

2553
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:53.100
<v Speaker 1>heart failure patients not so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This study should put to rest the </v>

2554
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:57.661
<v Speaker 1>practice of starting ssrs and depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients with heart failure in an </v>

2555
01:49:57.661 --> 01:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>attempt to affect cvd outcomes would a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cvd.</v>

2556
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Cardiovascular disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2557
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2558
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>well that's with people with heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems typically,</v>

2559
01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:10.531
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with depression and heart </v>

2560
01:50:10.531 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Fucking exercise I think is is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a requirement of the human body.</v>

2562
01:50:16.670 --> 01:50:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I really agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something even my darkest times,</v>

2563
01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.610
<v Speaker 1>so I'm never at my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more.</v>

2564
01:50:23.611 --> 01:50:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm never more at my best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then actually when I'm down,</v>

2565
01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.390
<v Speaker 1>when I'm going through things because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my,</v>

2566
01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:33.160
<v Speaker 1>my response to it is what it is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tighten up.</v>

2567
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It forces you to folk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2568
01:50:35.181 --> 01:50:40.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of those things that I do is </v>

2569
01:50:40.181 --> 01:50:43.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the gym everyday for the </v>

2570
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:43.560
<v Speaker 1>last two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2571
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forces me to one of those things that</v>

2572
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:49.801
<v Speaker 1>happened that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is I start working out more </v>

2573
01:50:49.801 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 1>because of the clarity of mind I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the fact,</v>

2574
01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the sense of accomplishment and</v>

2575
01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:55.480
<v Speaker 1>then it Kinda starts me off in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

2576
01:50:55.481 --> 01:50:56.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what's next?</v>

2577
01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chasing the next thing to conquer.</v>

2578
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2579
01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2580
01:51:01.091 --> 01:51:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you wholeheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2581
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I think focusing on focusing on means </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of just prescribing pills,</v>

2582
01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:12.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like taking pills.</v>

2583
01:51:12.191 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't like things that alter my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2584
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because I'm a control freak in </v>

2585
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:22.621
<v Speaker 1>that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy with 100 guns is a control </v>

2586
01:51:22.621 --> 01:51:22.621
<v Speaker 1>freak.</v>

2587
01:51:23.650 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I have something to say about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just thinking about.</v>

2588
01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I had thought while I was using your </v>
<v Speaker 1>super toilet,</v>

2589
01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:31.690
<v Speaker 1>crazy toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2590
01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the where to go.</v>

2591
01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

2592
01:51:35.681 --> 01:51:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2593
01:51:36.091 --> 01:51:36.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should get Joe Rogan,</v>

2594
01:51:36.951 --> 01:51:41.951
<v Speaker 1>one of my guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized you can't even </v>

2595
01:51:41.951 --> 01:51:41.951
<v Speaker 1>notice it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2596
01:51:41.951 --> 01:51:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I own?</v>

2597
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you have that I can own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A was the first gun I ever.</v>

2598
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 1>The first couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>

2599
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 1>So this one just so happens to be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can see.</v>

2600
01:51:49.650 --> 01:51:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You have a company that makes him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2601
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

2602
01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did was I came out with a </v>

2603
01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:57.100
<v Speaker 1>signature series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a line of handguns.</v>

2604
01:51:57.250 --> 01:52:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one because it's not allowed </v>

2605
01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:02.250
<v Speaker 1>to California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

2606
01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:02.250
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2607
01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:04.720
<v Speaker 1>y'all have a list of guns that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to own it.</v>

2608
01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like you would have to.</v>

2609
01:52:07.450 --> 01:52:12.450
<v Speaker 1>There's this micro stamping that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>required for any gun that's not on the </v>

2610
01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 1>list and it's so prohibitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2611
01:52:12.761 --> 01:52:15.230
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is different,</v>

2612
01:52:15.250 --> 01:52:18.010
<v Speaker 1>what kind of guns are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the other?</v>

2613
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Prohibited the one that you have that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have.</v>

2614
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have him pull it up.</v>

2615
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Sorry if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean that particular gun?</v>

2616
01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.910
<v Speaker 1>What's about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this Spec state?</v>

2617
01:52:27.911 --> 01:52:32.911
<v Speaker 1>Just it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is like it's just a list of </v>

2618
01:52:32.911 --> 01:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know exactly the caliber,</v>

2619
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the semiautomatic capabilities because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there some automatic guns on the list </v>

2620
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 1>that you're allowed to own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other.</v>

2621
01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It was just arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seemed like to me.</v>

2622
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:45.110
<v Speaker 1>What kind of gun is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

2623
01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 1>He'll look it up.</v>

2624

<v Speaker 2>Usually it comes up when I'm typing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2638
01:53:37.481 --> 01:53:42.481

2642
01:53:49.050 --> 01:53:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2643
01:53:50.021 --> 01:53:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Is the advocate someone might've been no</v>
<v Speaker 2>service unavailable.</v>

2644
01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>killed it.</v>

2649
01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of take a couple hundred people </v>

2650
01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:07.620
<v Speaker 2>at it by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time that it hits youtube though,</v>

2651
01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't it a blender to latest seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty seconds to type in,</v>

2652
01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:14.590
<v Speaker 2>type in the advocate and then calling on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war and then see what that does.</v>

2653
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And in like erase tier defense though.</v>

2654
01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

2655
01:54:23.770 --> 01:54:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click on the top 10.</v>

2656
01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.930
<v Speaker 2>We killed that website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to images.</v>

2657
01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Killed that website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the gun.</v>

2658
01:54:32.710 --> 01:54:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why?</v>

2659
01:54:33.551 --> 01:54:36.490
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a normal handgun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2660
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:38.710
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck is wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I have it?</v>

2661
01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask the folks that make </v>

2662
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>leaders in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are they saying is wrong with </v>

2663
01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like specifically,</v>

2664
01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:50.791
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they make the decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make in California to be honest </v>

2665
01:54:50.791 --> 01:54:50.791
<v Speaker 2>with what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the specs of this gun?</v>

2666
01:54:50.791 --> 01:54:52.360
<v Speaker 2>What it is a nine millimeter handgun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>semiautomatic.</v>

2667
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it because it's semiautomatic or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No?</v>

2668
01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2669
01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:57.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2670
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:59.680
<v Speaker 2>just I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the basis.</v>

2671
01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the,</v>

2672
01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:05.740
<v Speaker 2>the complete basis and reasons for why </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain guns are allowed.</v>

2673
01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Handgun wines of California and others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they're going to be tons</v>

2674
01:55:09.391 --> 01:55:12.020
<v Speaker 2>of people who tell me this because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a huge audience in California.</v>

2675
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my biggest audience,</v>

2676
01:55:14.170 --> 01:55:15.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of gun owners in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

2677
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:20.950
<v Speaker 2>People people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the idea that guns in </v>

2678
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:21.490
<v Speaker 2>California or somehow or another rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

2679
01:55:21.491 --> 01:55:23.320
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is the birthplace of </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are 15,</v>

2680
01:55:23.321 --> 01:55:26.410
<v Speaker 2>wasn't California now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a weird gun.</v>

2681
01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a gun that people just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonized.</v>

2682
01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:33.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not the most powerful gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the scariest gun nut but </v>

2683
01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:39.060
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't even use it in the </v>

2684
01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:39.060
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't use it in the military.</v>

2685
01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:39.880
<v Speaker 2>But to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did,</v>

2686
01:55:39.881 --> 01:55:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd want that gun.</v>

2687
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2688
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the most effective means to</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect myself,</v>

2689
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't.</v>

2690
01:55:47.701 --> 01:55:52.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutering guns to the point where I'm </v>

2691
01:55:52.701 --> 01:55:53.780
<v Speaker 2>too new to and get to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevance or ineffectiveness.</v>

2692
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:57.630
<v Speaker 2>It's people that don't use guns that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this idea,</v>

2693
01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.790
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we're at now.</v>

2694
01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out of this conversation with </v>

2695
01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 2>you is that there's not really a clean </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

2696
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.430
<v Speaker 2>There's not a clean answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if there was,</v>

2697
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:12.600
<v Speaker 2>people would have figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like society has to continue</v>

2698
01:56:12.601 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 2>to evolve and one of the ways society </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolves is having these conversations.</v>

2699
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 2>You and I having this conversation where</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few million people are going to listen</v>

2700
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:24.741
<v Speaker 2>to it and then millions of people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own having conversations and </v>

2701
01:56:24.741 --> 01:56:26.940
<v Speaker 2>people looking at the reality and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

2702
01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're doing is important </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what a lot of people are doing is </v>

2703
01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.080
<v Speaker 2>important where they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual numbers and the actual </v>

2704
01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:36.420
<v Speaker 2>statistics and letting us get a look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2705
01:56:36.630 --> 01:56:39.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's the one thing that I try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>convey with my videos.</v>

2706
01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't care where you stand on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

2707
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I just will have a shit ton of more </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for your position if it's from a</v>

2708
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:51.300
<v Speaker 2>position of education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you actually have some knowledge.</v>

2709
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Master firearms.</v>

2710
01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Just understand the very basics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentals.</v>

2711
01:56:58.830 --> 01:57:03.740
<v Speaker 2>We have politicians pushing policy based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on things that make no sense like it.</v>

2712
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:08.950
<v Speaker 2>It actually exposes the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything about firearms and </v>

2713
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:12.741
<v Speaker 2>so it was like you're going to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy on something that you don't know </v>

2714
01:57:12.741 --> 01:57:15.081
<v Speaker 2>anything about and so it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disingenuous and an inherently </v>

2715
01:57:15.081 --> 01:57:19.251
<v Speaker 2>dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the biggest frustration I </v>

2716
01:57:19.251 --> 01:57:19.251
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

2717
01:57:19.251 --> 01:57:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I might look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to educate you and give you </v>

2718
01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:25.011
<v Speaker 2>the information that you need so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make an informed opinion about </v>

2719
01:57:25.011 --> 01:57:28.431
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If at the end of the day I take you </v>

2720
01:57:28.431 --> 01:57:30.020
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you the stats I tell you about </v>

2721
01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.350
<v Speaker 2>how guns functioned and how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you still are anti-gun,</v>

2722
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I can respect that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you get to then push </v>

2723
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:37.710
<v Speaker 2>your anti gun agenda onto me and limit </v>
<v Speaker 2>my rights because of it,</v>

2724
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but I can respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least we can walk away and say,</v>

2725
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:45.051
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think we probably got it from a </v>

2726
01:57:45.051 --> 01:57:45.051
<v Speaker 2>different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that and I think we're also</v>

2727
01:57:45.051 --> 01:57:47.940
<v Speaker 2>faced with the reality of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sheer number of guns that we have in</v>

2728
01:57:47.941 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a staggering number,</v>

2729
01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:51.490
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to just take those </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

2730
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:52.680
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to put them?</v>

2731
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's just now there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

2732
01:57:55.771 --> 01:57:57.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can devolve the number over time,</v>

2733
01:57:57.661 --> 01:58:02.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can just put these laws and they can </v>

2734
01:58:02.661 --> 01:58:04.821
<v Speaker 2>get bad for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then overtime doing that weird </v>

2735
01:58:04.821 --> 01:58:06.340
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do wear all the time,</v>

2736
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:11.390
<v Speaker 2>just anti gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be interested in sitting down </v>

2737
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>like maybe on this show if I had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antique gun advocate?</v>

2738
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I beg for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2739
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to say not,</v>

2740
01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 2>not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

2741
01:58:19.170 --> 01:58:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to get up here in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crush this person and,</v>

2742
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.750
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that to death.</v>

2743
01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do want to have the conversation,</v>

2744
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:30.210
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I've done it on my show.</v>

2745
01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:33.030
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's too easy to ignore it because of</v>

2746
01:58:33.031 --> 01:58:37.380
<v Speaker 2>the platform that you had someone on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your show that made reasonable points,</v>

2747
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:40.450
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody wanted to watch you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2748
01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:45.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sort of a debate with an gun </v>

2749
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:45.940
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a show that you could recommend</v>

2750
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that people would go watch right now?</v>

2751
01:58:47.010 --> 01:58:47.940
<v Speaker 2>That was on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2752
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.510
<v Speaker 2>On your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On my show.</v>

2753
01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:50.630
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

2754
01:58:50.631 --> 01:58:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2755
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:58.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest flaws of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were on my show that we had that </v>

2756
01:58:58.290 --> 01:59:01.801
<v Speaker 2>conversation with is you could instantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it was more of an education process </v>

2757
01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.390
<v Speaker 2>because you could tell they didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2758
01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen is that they make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point about why they believe this.</v>

2759
01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Then I would give them information and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it'd be like,</v>

2760
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2761
01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:13.150
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what I'm saying?</v>

2762
01:59:14.490 --> 01:59:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's someone out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is educated and in kids anti-gun.</v>

2763
01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have someone find them.</v>

2764
01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this.</v>

2765
01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I have a publicist will have him love </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt stags on.</v>

2766
01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Please let me know because I'd be all </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

2767
01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really would.</v>

2768
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:33.440
<v Speaker 2>There's probably someone out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's reasonable that has good points </v>

2769
01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.830
<v Speaker 2>and has a well thought out sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2770
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:38.170
<v Speaker 2>It would be interesting to listen to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to that person.</v>

2771
01:59:38.230 --> 01:59:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think one of the things we can </v>

2772
01:59:43.230 --> 01:59:45.151
<v Speaker 2>take away from this is that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a messy situation.</v>

2773
01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

2774
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting poison in the water,</v>

2775
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 2>stopped putting poison in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean up the water.</v>

2776
01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:55.740
<v Speaker 2>It is not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not super complicated.</v>

2777
01:59:55.741 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deals with mental health.</v>

2778
01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:01.120
<v Speaker 2>It deals with freedom and it deals with </v>
<v Speaker 2>law abiding.</v>

2779
02:00:01.121 --> 02:00:06.121
<v Speaker 2>People aren't doing anything wrong where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are trying to take away their </v>

2780
02:00:06.121 --> 02:00:06.121
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're enthusiasts.</v>

2781
02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:08.230
<v Speaker 2>They love guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any like,</v>

2782
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:09.370
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>

2783
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:12.550
<v Speaker 2>You are sitting here with a gun on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>

2784
02:00:12.551 --> 02:00:14.050
<v Speaker 2>What kind of gun is at ar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>

2785
02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>You have an ar 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually selfies I have.</v>

2786
02:00:17.230 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I have an archery shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could walk anywhere with this.</v>

2787
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:21.500
<v Speaker 2>No one would feel threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2788
02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill the fuck out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2789
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:27.550
<v Speaker 2>But no one would feel threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you walk around with that,</v>

2790
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.490
<v Speaker 2>people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2791
02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>you are one of those gun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you telling people you have that on </v>

2792
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2793
02:00:36.491 --> 02:00:38.830
<v Speaker 2>You warning people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a dangerous person,</v>

2794
02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2795
02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:41.230
<v Speaker 2>you're an archery enthusiasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2796
02:00:41.231 --> 02:00:43.750
<v Speaker 2>so I did archery at camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in the boy scouts,</v>

2797
02:00:43.751 --> 02:00:48.751
<v Speaker 2>we shot bows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start opening girls at the </v>

2798
02:00:48.751 --> 02:00:48.751
<v Speaker 2>bar with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2799
02:00:48.751 --> 02:00:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I shoot archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bad movie,</v>

2800
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad move.</v>

2801
02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:54.280
<v Speaker 2>So listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the conversation.</v>

2802
02:00:54.281 --> 02:00:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we got anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you can.</v>

2803
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2804
02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.760
<v Speaker 2>to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a conversation that needs.</v>

2805
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things happen in our,</v>

2806
02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.000
<v Speaker 2>in our reality that forced a specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on the part of the conversation.</v>

2807
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2808
02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:09.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we weren't going to say,</v>

2809
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long we been here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long we've been.</v>

2810
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours,</v>

2811
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been having this gun debate for </v>

2812
02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:17.590
<v Speaker 2>how long now in this country for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2813
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but I think for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the people who follow me,</v>

2814
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>they wanted me to come on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because you and I were going to come</v>

2815
02:01:23.531 --> 02:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>to an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to educate,</v>

2816
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:31.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well also to have what we have on the </v>

2817
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:32.020
<v Speaker 2>show where I try to have on the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>just discussions,</v>

2818
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:33.130
<v Speaker 2>just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2819
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And let people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let people express themselves.</v>

2820
02:01:36.131 --> 02:01:37.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think you definitely did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2821
02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>You Express yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very reasonable guy.</v>

2822
02:01:40.071 --> 02:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Anybody looks at you and says you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniacal gun nut.</v>

2823
02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>You pulling that out of your own head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:50.261
<v Speaker 2>try to find somebody will try to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody if you're open to that.</v>

2826
02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to find somebody that could,</v>

2827
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>could argue the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thank you brother.</v>
