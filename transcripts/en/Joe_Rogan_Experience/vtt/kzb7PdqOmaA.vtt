<v Speaker 1>Just trying to recall anything.</v>

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.193
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.153
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget to wash it out.</v>

11
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget to wash it.</v>

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So this is what's going on folks.</v>

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting here around waiting for Graham Hancock to get here.</v>

14
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>He was doing some sort of a seminar in Orange County.</v>

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.361
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

16
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>that's like at least an hour away.</v>

18
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So don't get an I instead of just sitting here staring at each other,</v>

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>decided to stare at each other online.</v>

20
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>So that is the,</v>

21
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.661
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

22
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the basic motivation for this podcast.</v>

24
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

25
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I ended up by getting out here.</v>

26
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:57.801
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

27
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:58.101
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

28
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I ended up in some,</v>

29
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>my gps took me in a bad direction as time.</v>

30
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 2>You're out in the middle and nowhere,</v>

31
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.181
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

32
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:06.014
<v Speaker 2>I ended up</v>

33
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

34
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>in a place that was like the surface of the moon.</v>

35
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the fuck it was.</v>

36
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 2>Spooky.</v>

37
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.301
<v Speaker 2>It was spooky.</v>

38
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Like I could have gone off a cliff and no one would have found me for a week.</v>

39
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.681
<v Speaker 2>He'd be fine too.</v>

40
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.514
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>

41
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.503
<v Speaker 2>You're tweaking.</v>

42
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.961
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

43
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:22.411
<v Speaker 2>You're tweaking,</v>

44
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:22.671
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

45
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 2>We're tweaking bro.</v>

46
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You scared of nature tariff.</v>

47
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not scared of nature,</v>

48
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but I am scared at night when I'm,</v>

49
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 2>when you're going around like winding curves through math country,</v>

50
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:38.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly like exactly comfortable those Carly's lives out there.</v>

51
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of people live out there,</v>

52
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>but my window space,</v>

53
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>they like to be away from each other.</v>

54
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I like space.</v>

55
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Why do people assume that?</v>

56
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>But there's a strange thing why people assume that when someone wants to be a</v>

57
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>way that they want the want some space between you and them,</v>

58
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>there's something creepy about him all day and you're out there and fucking</v>

59
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>cooking math and you know,</v>

60
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you're automatically assume.</v>

61
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Why is that cabin by itself?</v>

62
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Would that chimney blowing smoke?</v>

63
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are they cooking in there?</v>

64
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't look at it and go look at that guy.</v>

67
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>He's out there just doing it by himself.</v>

68
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.014
<v Speaker 1>Chopping Wood.</v>

69
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.261
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

70
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

71
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Assume automatically that some creepy thing is going on out there and if he's by</v>

72
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

73
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>when traditionally they're creepy people are the ones who live underneath you on</v>

74
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:18.414
<v Speaker 2>your apartment.</v>

75
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>There was a real creep.</v>

76
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 2>So once you're masturbating to your footsteps,</v>

77
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 2>but step fetish,</v>

78
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

79
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a documentary,</v>

80
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.731
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

81
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>vbs.tv.</v>

83
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.533
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

84
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

85
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it a documentary,</v>

86
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'd call it a a,</v>

87
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>an episode where they went and they went and visited this guy who lives in like</v>

88
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>northern eastern Alaska.</v>

89
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>He lives like way the fuck up there.</v>

90
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>They have to drop him off supplies and he lives in this little tiny shack and</v>

91
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the few people that's allowed to live there.</v>

92
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And he's been there for like 20 years.</v>

93
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>This dude never even saw nine 11.</v>

94
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>He never saw the towers go down.</v>

95
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>He'd like heard that something had happened.</v>

96
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>He's so removed from everything.</v>

97
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He's got like a little generated.</v>

98
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes he powers up a TV,</v>

99
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.661
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

100
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and he's got movies that they watch.</v>

101
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.061
<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>

102
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:15.061
<v Speaker 1>this guy's living in the woods in a tiny one room house with his wife who looks</v>

103
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of an Eskimo,</v>

104
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>type of woman and uh,</v>

106
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking happy shit up there.</v>

107
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>He says that hunting and gathering,</v>

108
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like what keeps you happy and that's what,</v>

109
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>what keeps him happy.</v>

110
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>He's out there shooting Caribou and following them.</v>

111
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

112
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>

113
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>dude loves it.</v>

114
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>He loves living up there.</v>

115
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It sounds great that he had a shoot a bear on one of the episodes because the</v>

116
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>bear had came too close to his house and the bear bear's killed her dogs and</v>

117
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:39.694
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

118
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's the middle of the night.</v>

119
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>They're running after this guy with a camera and he's running through the woods</v>

120
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking shotgun and a boom,</v>

121
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

122
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>He just blowing holes into this fucking bear and chasing it down while they're</v>

123
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>all chasing after him with cameras in the middle of the night in the woods in</v>

124
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.404
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>

125
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

126
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it's gnarly.</v>

127
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

128
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.001
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

129
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.421
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

130
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.020
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing footage too.</v>

131
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

132
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>it's such an interesting insight to someone who would choose to live that life.</v>

133
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>which seems so horrifying to us.</v>

135
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>But to him like our life is just fucking mundane.</v>

136
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to it.</v>

137
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You just can't get excited.</v>

138
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's horrifying.</v>

139
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

140
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it sounds amazing.</v>

141
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something about being self sufficient that seems like it feels so</v>

142
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 2>incredibly good to be completely off the grid.</v>

143
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 2>And now that if the,</v>

144
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 2>if everything fell apart,</v>

145
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 2>your life would barely shift at all.</v>

146
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:04:35.061 --> 00:04:35.781
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

148
00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:36.081
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

149
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:36.591
<v Speaker 1>But that's like,</v>

150
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:39.410
<v Speaker 1>is that like instincts to not join the system?</v>

151
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.491
<v Speaker 1>is that what that is?</v>

153
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that some sort of a resistance of the hive,</v>

154
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:46.130
<v Speaker 1>that would feel good to not need all these people,</v>

156
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

157
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that ridiculous?</v>

158
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Because the reason why everything is so awesome,</v>

159
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>the reason why society in general so awesome is because millions of people</v>

160
00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:56.540
<v Speaker 1>contributed to make this one colossal thing that relies on millions of people.</v>

161
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

162
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but because all these other people are involved,</v>

163
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking awesome.</v>

164
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:01.544
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

165
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>It's got some terrible parts about it too.</v>

166
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:06.410
<v Speaker 1>But the idea itself and what can be accomplished with it,</v>

167
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking amazing.</v>

168
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So why do we want to not need that?</v>

169
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want,</v>

170
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>do we want to keep the option open to be a cunt so you can just fucking fuck off</v>

171
00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>and just going to go live off Caribou in the middle of nowhere?</v>

172
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Well that's that.</v>

173
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like the argument.</v>

174
00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:21.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

175
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:24.620
<v Speaker 2>like people have that argument against monks.</v>

176
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Like when someone goes and becomes a monk,</v>

177
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.200
<v Speaker 2>it's the same argument.</v>

178
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

179
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.671
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

180
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:33.620
<v Speaker 2>You're ignoring all of society to go and do and be a monk.</v>

181
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it better to be in the world than it is to go and isolate yourself?</v>

182
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 2>How if you do go and isolate yourself or you,</v>

183
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.820
<v Speaker 2>so whatever you learn,</v>

184
00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:41.331
<v Speaker 2>you're still,</v>

185
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not applicable to people in the world,</v>

186
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.301
<v Speaker 2>but some monks,</v>

187
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they give a shit.</v>

188
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

189
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>some people they just don't care.</v>

191
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

192
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 2>they're not concerned with the society.</v>

193
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

194
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any difference to them whether they're contributing or not.</v>

195
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Like who cares?</v>

196
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

197
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I hear you man.</v>

198
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.791
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

199
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I've had that thought in my head about monks.</v>

200
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:01.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

201
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

202
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.500
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

203
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.601
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

204
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:02.711
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

205
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a loser?</v>

206
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Just where's the fucking orange robe and never beats off and just hides and</v>

207
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>chance all day.</v>

208
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

209
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.691
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You mentioned down on shit talking.</v>

219
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're missing out on astral projection.</v>

220
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't send your spirit to the higher dimensional planes to communicate with</v>

221
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the supreme gods or third eye's sealed shut.</v>

222
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.110
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea about the,</v>

223
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.380
<v Speaker 2>what it feels like to be completely in tune vibrating with the harmony of the</v>

224
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:39.160
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

225
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.993
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

226
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 2>you're just humping your leg humping down there and the city while I'm floating</v>

227
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:47.200
<v Speaker 2>around the eternal paradise,</v>

228
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.423
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

229
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.470
<v Speaker 2>outside of time and space and then like here or transcend them.</v>

230
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.313
<v Speaker 2>Bliss.</v>

231
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's a monk who could talk that good shit?</v>

232
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.540
<v Speaker 2>If there a model that you talk like that,</v>

233
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>say things like that,</v>

234
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>that guy should like be doing tours,</v>

235
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>he would recruit monks like left and right.</v>

237
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>You can change the world.</v>

238
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>If a guy could speak that way about being a monk?</v>

239
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

240
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:08.490
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

241
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.781
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

242
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:08.861
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I think what theoretically,</v>

244
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 2>what may happen is that as,</v>

245
00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:17.871
<v Speaker 2>as you evolve and begin to like open your or is up,</v>

246
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is purely theoretical,</v>

247
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think that you begin to extinguish the desire to eat,</v>

248
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.773
<v Speaker 2>to tour.</v>

249
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 2>You extinguish the desire to do,</v>

250
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.420
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

251
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>to perform.</v>

252
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do that anymore.</v>

253
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 2>You're just kind of in another place all together you've zoomed out.</v>

254
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like Google maps use zoom so far out that year.</v>

255
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that the more you would go down the road of meditation,</v>

256
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the less you would want to do standup comedy or you're saying,</v>

257
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.550
<v Speaker 1>is that what you mean by tour?</v>

258
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:45.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

260
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:45.921
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

261
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:46.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

262
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the show,</v>

263
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 2>like the uh,</v>

264
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 2>exhibitionism,</v>

265
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:49.901
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

267
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 2>the for you were saying somebody you talk like that she should tour and talk to</v>

268
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

269
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

270
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying someone who talks like that,</v>

271
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 2>and it's all a theory.</v>

273
00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.321
<v Speaker 2>It's an all,</v>

274
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a theoretical idea.</v>

275
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:01.964
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

276
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.571
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

278
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.530
<v Speaker 2>the assumption when someone becomes a renunciate I think is that they're,</v>

280
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:08.151
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

281
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>they're not experiencing happiness.</v>

282
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

283
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

284
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 2>When it may be that the thing that they're experiencing,</v>

285
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a million times better than what they were experiencing in the world.</v>

286
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

287
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that I have achieved at least bizarre states of consciousness</v>

288
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:22.831
<v Speaker 1>just from,</v>

289
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:23.664
<v Speaker 1>from yoga.</v>

290
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.081
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

291
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:24.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

292
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time,</v>

293
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

294
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York and I was real nervous.</v>

295
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.101
<v Speaker 1>I had to do,</v>

296
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

297
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the Howard stern show the next day.</v>

298
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>It was first time I ever did it and no one,</v>

299
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I was genuinely nervous and I couldn't sleep.</v>

300
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.340
<v Speaker 1>So it was in my hotel room reading off of this ancient yoga book and doing these</v>

301
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:39.951
<v Speaker 1>poses.</v>

302
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And I did yoga for like an hour and a half.</v>

303
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of it I felt fucking great.</v>

304
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just feel great.</v>

306
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I felt high.</v>

307
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I felt,</v>

308
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

309
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>my body was like,</v>

310
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I felt team goals,</v>

311
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>like a glowing tingle.</v>

312
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

313
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I did this intense yoga routine for an hour and a half.</v>

314
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>And when it was over,</v>

315
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>my body had just stretch everything out,</v>

316
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>

317
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>all the tension opened up,</v>

318
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

319
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:10.151
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

320
00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the whatever the fuck it is.</v>

321
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>You want to call it shock rose.</v>

322
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:13.720
<v Speaker 1>You want to call it senses,</v>

323
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to call it,</v>

324

00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Your ability to tune in to what's around you was all,</v>

332
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>it was just cranked to 10 and I was like,</v>

333
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:22.510
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

334

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it can feel very much like a real mild pot,</v>

337
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.070

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>like nothing.</v>

340
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that's going to make you fucking drive shitty or forget your keys.</v>

341
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes it's going to make you just a little,</v>

342
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:39.841
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

345
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little more relaxed.</v>

346
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little sensitive.</v>

347
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

348

<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>

349
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.041

353
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I felt that too from yoga and I felt that from chanting and I felt that from any</v>

354
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:54.950
<v Speaker 2>kind of ritualistic thing that has,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual undertones to it,</v>

357
00:09:57.081 --> 00:09:58.310
<v Speaker 2>which I think yoga does.</v>

358
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

359
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 1>You got deep into chanting,</v>

360
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:00.471
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

361
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>

362
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>You got at one point in time you were,</v>

363
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

365
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can chant out that fucking crazy.</v>

368
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I got deep into it.</v>

369
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.471
<v Speaker 1>What is that thing that you,</v>

370
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.304
<v Speaker 1>you busted out?</v>

371
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Bad thing is that,</v>

372
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a Hari Krishna prayer.</v>

373
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a prayer that you read before that you say before you're going to read</v>

374
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:19.430
<v Speaker 2>the Bhagavad Gita and it means,</v>

375
00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 2>are you Christians read the Bhagavad Gita?</v>

376
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

377
00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 2>That's our primary text.</v>

378
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>That and the stream on bog of a time.</v>

379
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

380
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.473
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

381
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:26.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

382
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you say that prayer.</v>

383
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.203
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

384
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 2>and they have a bunch of other texts too.</v>

385
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:30.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

386
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:31.724
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>

387
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.640
<v Speaker 2>that's how they spend most of their time is studying the Vedas.</v>

388
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

389
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.830
<v Speaker 1>So there know almost nothing about the Hari Krishna is all I know that when,</v>

390
00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

391
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.910
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

392
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:41.530
<v Speaker 1>people made fun of the Hari Krishna,</v>

393
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was like a stock joke.</v>

394
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

395
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:44.414
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

396
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

397
00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And in movies to an airplane.</v>

398
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>And so many movies they get made fun of because they would go and hang out at</v>

399
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:49.911
<v Speaker 2>the airports.</v>

400
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:53.570
<v Speaker 2>And then these guys in saffron robes with shaved heads,</v>

401
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's like he,</v>

403
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.730
<v Speaker 2>we try to sell books,</v>

404
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

405
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

406
00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:57.020
<v Speaker 2>They tried to,</v>

407
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>they tried to sell books and so there's a lot of reasons that they did get made</v>

408
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:02.534
<v Speaker 2>fun of.</v>

409
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

410
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.031
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

411
00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>what happened to me was,</v>

412
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

413
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 1>well there's also a bunch of legal cases too,</v>

414
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

415
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Weren't there like real life scenarios?</v>

416
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

417
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.060
<v Speaker 2>It's organized religion,</v>

418
00:11:13.061 --> 00:11:13.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

419
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:13.550
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

420
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.080
<v Speaker 2>and it's hardcore organized religion that recommends,</v>

421
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

422
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 2>renouncing the world.</v>

424
00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:20.161
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>

425
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:20.491
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

426
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't tip toe around the fact,</v>

427
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 2>like it's hardcore into the idea that the,</v>

428
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

429
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 2>the way to live if you really want to be happy,</v>

430
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:33.130
<v Speaker 2>is to let go of all the things of the world and start chanting,</v>

431
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:33.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

432
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>the Hari Krishna Maha Mantra and the,</v>

433
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.331
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

434
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:38.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

435
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

436
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's very important to realize that that mantra is not owned by Iskcon,</v>

437
00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 2>which is the Hari Krishna is,</v>

438
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:50.161
<v Speaker 2>that's like the Catholic Church for this sect of Hinduism,</v>

439
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.733
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

440
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>which is known Bhakti Yoga.</v>

441
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of different schools of thought in it.</v>

442
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:02.311
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very deep philosophy that has its roots in the idea that there is,</v>

443
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.724
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

444
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 2>that God,</v>

445
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 2>everything comes from God.</v>

446
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:11.971
<v Speaker 2>And so the word Krishna means translates into the reservoir of all pleasure.</v>

447
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's the idea is like all pleasure,</v>

448
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 2>all opulence,</v>

449
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 2>all happiness,</v>

450
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 2>everything springs from some source,</v>

451
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 2>like the big bang except the spiritual big bang.</v>

452
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And this is that they believe that this is an intelligent force in the universe</v>

453
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>that has specific qualities.</v>

454
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And so people are kind of born with this case of Amnesia where they've forgotten</v>

455
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>that this even exists.</v>

456
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 2>And so they begin to become attracted to these qualities and different things.</v>

457
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 2>So people are attracted to beauty,</v>

458
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 2>people are attracted to intelligence,</v>

459
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 2>people are attracted to wealth,</v>

460
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 2>people are attracted to um,</v>

461
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

462
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.530
<v Speaker 2>But they say that these are just the sort of the,</v>

463
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

464
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 2>what people are seeing as the qualities of the supreme being reflected through</v>

465
00:12:58.841 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 2>the material universe.</v>

466
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people are attracted to.</v>

467
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And so by the specific process of Bhakti Yoga,</v>

468
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you begin to turn your,</v>

469
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.280
<v Speaker 2>your senses back towards the original source of all this stuff through this</v>

471
00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:11.891
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

472
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>very strict discipline of chanting not eating meat.</v>

473
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

474
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.920
<v Speaker 2>they recommend the,</v>

475
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 2>the monks that where the rubs,</v>

476
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.010
<v Speaker 2>it's called the four regulative principles.</v>

477
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>So you don't eat meat,</v>

478
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>you don't use any intoxicants,</v>

479
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>no sex and no gambling.</v>

480
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 2>You wake up at four every morning,</v>

481
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 2>four 30 every morning.</v>

482
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 2>You chant I think 16 rounds of this mantra,</v>

483
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:39.251
<v Speaker 2>Hari Krishna,</v>

484
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:39.761
<v Speaker 2>Hari Krishna,</v>

485
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:40.061
<v Speaker 2>Krishna,</v>

486
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.361
<v Speaker 2>Krishna,</v>

487
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:40.511
<v Speaker 2>Yada,</v>

488
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:40.721
<v Speaker 2>Yada,</v>

489
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:40.931
<v Speaker 2>Yada.</v>

490
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 2>It all mounted on Ron,</v>

491
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:46.831
<v Speaker 2>Ron Manati and you study and you will live in a temple and that's how you spend</v>

492
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

493
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a,</v>

494
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 2>and you're still in the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

495
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>You're studying the Vedas,</v>

496
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.721
<v Speaker 2>the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

497
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:56.920
<v Speaker 2>and the Shreem ABOG of a Tom and all these other religious texts.</v>

498
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And you get deep,</v>

499
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

500
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 2>deep into it,</v>

501
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 2>to the point where you complete,</v>

502
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were recommend in,</v>

503
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 2>as I recall there,</v>

504
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like your fee,</v>

505
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.060
<v Speaker 2>even your family,</v>

506
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 2>your family is just a,</v>

507
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.400
<v Speaker 2>your is your Karma,</v>

508
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:12.890
<v Speaker 2>your fan,</v>

509
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 2>like your attachment to your family.</v>

510
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just your Karma.</v>

511
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

512
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 2>let go of all those attachments,</v>

513
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 2>surrender to this higher force and then you'll experience transcend the</v>

514
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:24.731
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

515
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>And the ultimate goal in life is to try to connect with God.</v>

516
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason to be alive.</v>

517
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not engaged in that activity,</v>

518
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 2>then you're miserable.</v>

519
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Then you're not really experiencing the type of happiness that,</v>

520
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 2>and even if you think you're experiencing happiness,</v>

521
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing compared to what you can obtain from a living,</v>

522
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual life and chanting this mantra and what happened to me.</v>

523
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 2>But this is what you are not saying is your opinion.</v>

524
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>You're saying</v>

525
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.530
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>

526
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:52.801
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

527
00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:53.221
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

528
00:14:53.221 --> 00:14:53.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:14:53.461 --> 00:14:54.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a summary of,</v>

530
00:14:54.331 --> 00:14:54.721
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

531
00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not my opinion,</v>

532
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.750
<v Speaker 2>but what happened to me,</v>

533
00:14:57.751 --> 00:14:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it like almost like in the first person,</v>

534
00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:00.880
<v Speaker 2>like Oh yeah,</v>

00:15:02.281 --> 00:15:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a,</v>

540
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe that though,</v>

541
00:15:04.051 --> 00:15:04.884
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

542
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.371
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

543
00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a comedian.</v>

544

<v Speaker 1>have you ever considered that?</v>

548
00:15:13.861 --> 00:15:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would be a path that you would,</v>

549
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you would get so interested in it because you are interested in all those</v>

550
00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:22.080
<v Speaker 1>principles you are interested in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>

564

<v Speaker 2>If you have an experience,</v>

565
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept that the experience happened and you have to tell the truth</v>

566
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 2>about the experience one way or the other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I was sitting in the,</v>

586
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 2>in the temple and they're like ringing bells and they have these like deities</v>

587
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 2>that they were shipped and they're pouring this,</v>

588
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

589
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:23.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

590
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I believe they pour like milk on the deities and it's like there's this,</v>

591
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 2>it's all your senses are being uh,</v>

592
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed.</v>

593
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 2>They're burning incense,</v>

594
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 2>they've got like the flowers everywhere.</v>

595
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So the whole place just garlands of flowers.</v>

596
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:40.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's just the smell of flowers and incense and monks,</v>

597
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:46.271
<v Speaker 2>like the guys with shaved heads and then necklaces that they wear and like bells</v>

599
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:46.761
<v Speaker 2>ringing.</v>

600
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 2>So your senses are completely overcome.</v>

601
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And I've never had this experience before or since,</v>

602
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.120
<v Speaker 2>but I was looking at these symbols and all of a sudden assembles.</v>

603
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It felt like I was seeing past the symbols into something deeper than what those</v>

604
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:03.771
<v Speaker 2>symbols were.</v>

605
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:08.771
<v Speaker 2>The symbols were just a human's attempt to try to embody this greater thing that</v>

606
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>exists in the universe.</v>

607
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden I felt the only way I can explain it is it felt like I was</v>

608
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.690
<v Speaker 2>sound so crazy.</v>

609
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 2>It felt like I was on a spaceship.</v>

610
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

611
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.301
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

612
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 2>this is like an advance.</v>

613
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 2>This is what an advanced intelligence is like this.</v>

614
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.720
<v Speaker 2>It felt like I was looking at something that was a billion times smarter than I</v>

615
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:29.391
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

616
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:34.391
<v Speaker 2>and that it was being somehow tuned into and this ritual that if you were</v>

617
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.240
<v Speaker 2>outside the ritual or just look like a lot of pomp and maybe some brainwash</v>

618
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:41.204
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

619
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

620
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 2>going through the motions of something.</v>

622
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 2>But in the inside of it,</v>

623
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>it felt like this incredible blast of super intelligence.</v>

624
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And that happened to me and I like it.</v>

625
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 2>It changed me for mine,</v>

626
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of my life.</v>

627
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll be changed because of that.</v>

628
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll never be the same after that.</v>

629
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it was?</v>

630
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it was a combination of anxiety?</v>

631
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Because all these people are there and do what you said you were.</v>

632
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

633
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

634
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.023
<v Speaker 2>What were you high on?</v>

635
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana g eat it or smoking it?</v>

636
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.083
<v Speaker 2>Smoked it.</v>

637
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it was?</v>

638
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.571
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

639
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you attribute this?</v>

640
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

641
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty crazy experience you're talking about.</v>

642
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

643
00:18:20.221 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I think that,</v>

644
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:21.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

645
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:23.740
<v Speaker 2>what it was the chance.</v>

646
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

647
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.103
<v Speaker 2>it's the chant.</v>

648
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:25.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

649
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>if you chant Hari,</v>

650
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Hari Krishna is you don't have to be a Om Hari Krishna to Chant</v>

651
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Hari Krishna.</v>

652
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

653
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.050
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that they always said a,</v>

654
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.030
<v Speaker 2>the thing that,</v>

655
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

656
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

657
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:37.900
<v Speaker 2>prob apart,</v>

658
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 2>the founder of the art Christian has said is just Janet,</v>

659
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 2>you have nothing to lose.</v>

660
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.461
<v Speaker 2>Chanted.</v>

661
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does it do you?</v>

662
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:47.180
<v Speaker 2>You're saying this specific sin synchronized series of sounds,</v>

663
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 2>this chant,</v>

664
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 2>how's,</v>

665
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 2>has an effect that actually puts you in a psychedelic state?</v>

666
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

667
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:52.921
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

668
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was like,</v>

669
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why all the hippies loved it,</v>

670
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:55.081
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

671

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.521
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

674
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:56.701
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

675
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:57.534
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

676
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

677
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 2>think of yoga.</v>

678
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is a,</v>

679
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

680

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

681
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 2>specific movements that you do that if you do these movements,</v>

682
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you go into like what you said,</v>

683
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:06.930
<v Speaker 2>this mild psychedelic state.</v>

684
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Well that's just one form of Hatha Yoga or whatever particular type of yoga you</v>

685
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 2>are doing.</v>

686
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 2>But in the same way the,</v>

687
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>these mantras that they have,</v>

688
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.813
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

689
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 2>induce a very specific experience that,</v>

690
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

691
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 2>if you do it enough,</v>

692
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

693
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:26.260
<v Speaker 2>it'll light.</v>

694
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.950
<v Speaker 2>The only way to explain it is it will,</v>

695
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 2>your mood will lighten.</v>

696
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.811
<v Speaker 2>You will,</v>

697
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

698
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the heavy,</v>

699
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:33.660
<v Speaker 2>that heaviness man.</v>

701
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:34.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

702
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

703
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a heaviness that people get that I get and if I'm deeply in this state</v>

704
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 2>that it's what I consider,</v>

705
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 2>like the road rage state,</v>

706
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.001
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

707
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Where I'm likely to scream in a car,</v>

708
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 2>cutting me off or something.</v>

709
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

710
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.230
<v Speaker 2>if you chant Hari Krishna or any of the other,</v>

711
00:19:48.231 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of other mantras out there,</v>

712
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

713
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

714
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>and you do it regularly just for a week,</v>

715
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.790
<v Speaker 2>then you will experience a change in your consciousness.</v>

716
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.490
<v Speaker 2>early all isn't,</v>

718
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 2>how are you attributing that mean?</v>

719
00:19:59.641 --> 00:19:59.871
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

720
00:19:59.871 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

721
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:00.571
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

722
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 2>what could possibly be?</v>

723
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

724
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.730
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific standpoint,</v>

725
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

726
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the scientific,</v>

727
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:05.671
<v Speaker 2>let's look,</v>

728
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>go to scientists might say,</v>

729
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I think as scientists would say,</v>

730
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:07.831
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

731
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:09.090

<v Speaker 2>it goes down.</v>

770
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Well what Brahm does it talked about this and said that it's like kind of the</v>

771
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:05.651
<v Speaker 2>way you,</v>

772
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Chan is just an indication of the,</v>

773
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:07.690
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>

774
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 2>where you are in life.</v>

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.031
<v Speaker 2>You know like,</v>

776
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:11.710

777
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 2>the Channing will slow down.</v>

778

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I ended up changing fast and I'll try to slow myself down,</v>

782
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.340

00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm still hearing the exhale,</v>

880
00:23:29.661 --> 00:23:33.050
<v Speaker 1>echo and then home and I can I get,</v>

881
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I get deep.</v>

882
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

883
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I go deep into crazy train town,</v>

884
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>crazy train woods,</v>

885
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.920
<v Speaker 2>the woods of the universe.</v>

886
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.640
<v Speaker 2>He wa well,</v>

887
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.241
<v Speaker 2>that's the I,</v>

888
00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>that sound is considered the original sound vibration of the universe.</v>

889
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the sound that all things emerge from.</v>

890
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:50.050
<v Speaker 2>That's like the basic primordial sound.</v>

891
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

892
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 1>It was a big bang that you went home.</v>

893
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Or when Bob fucking boom.</v>

894
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.020
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

895
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.630
<v Speaker 1>what a shitty theory that is.</v>

896
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.760
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang is the shittiest theory ever.</v>

897
00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:08.950
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not a scientist and I'm clearly,</v>

898
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:09.784
<v Speaker 1>I'm retarded,</v>

899
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

900
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.530
<v Speaker 1>and I know that there's some evidence,</v>

901
00:24:11.531 --> 00:24:14.350
<v Speaker 1>supposedly that some big explosion happened 14 billion years,</v>

902
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but th th th they have no idea why everything was smaller than the head of a pin</v>

903
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.210
<v Speaker 1>letting you talk.</v>

904
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

905
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.721
<v Speaker 7>And so wait a minute.</v>

906
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 7>We do with it.</v>

907
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 7>Everything was smaller than the head of the,</v>

908
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:27.050
<v Speaker 7>but why was it swollen that we don't know?</v>

909
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.913
<v Speaker 7>We don't know.</v>

910
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.820
<v Speaker 7>But we do believe that there was an infant point where the whole universal is</v>

911
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 7>smaller than the head of a pin.</v>

912
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know why.</v>

913
00:24:33.961 --> 00:24:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest fucking conversation ever.</v>

914
00:24:36.481 --> 00:24:38.670
<v Speaker 1>This is like someone said it best.</v>

915
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It might have been Mckenna,</v>

916
00:24:39.991 --> 00:24:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I think Terence Mckenna said,</v>

917
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

918
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>it's as if they're asking you just believe in magic only once.</v>

919
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

920
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:52.603
<v Speaker 7>Magic.</v>

921
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.180
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

922
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

923
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.500
<v Speaker 1>they've read recently figured out a way to get subatomic particles to move</v>

924
00:24:58.501 --> 00:24:59.334
<v Speaker 1>faster and light.</v>

925
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they believe they've accomplished now.</v>

926
00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

927
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it was just really a week ago the scientists were saying time travel is</v>

928
00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 1>impossible because the speed of light cannot be surpassed.</v>

929
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.670
<v Speaker 1>And then like a couple of weeks later,</v>

930
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.910
<v Speaker 1>these guys say they got subatomic particles to move faster and like time travel</v>

931
00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:15.510
<v Speaker 1>was open again.</v>

932
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's the implication.</v>

933
00:25:16.621 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

934
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>time travel was the big implication because once they figured out how to an</v>

935
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.384
<v Speaker 1>actually mean,</v>

936
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.470
<v Speaker 1>it would require an immense amount of power.</v>

937
00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:27.471
<v Speaker 1>But just thinking about what powers your cell phone today and what was like to</v>

938
00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:28.350
<v Speaker 1>have those,</v>

939
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Apollo 11 computers when they filled an entire rooms and they weren't nearly as</v>

941
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:35.850
<v Speaker 1>powerful as your cell phone and your cell phone,</v>

942
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.470
<v Speaker 1>not even plugged in anything.</v>

943
00:25:37.471 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It's in your fucking pocket.</v>

944
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain what that,</v>

945
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.303
<v Speaker 2>I know they,</v>

946
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can cause I don't understand it.</v>

947
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:43.401
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

948
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I they will blast it to neutrinos or something.</v>

949
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:50.350
<v Speaker 2>And then it trinos where they reached where there were supposed to reach a few</v>

950
00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:53.380
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds before they should have reached it or something.</v>

951
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge question.</v>

952
00:25:54.401 --> 00:25:54.791
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

953
00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:57.940
<v Speaker 2>let's look it up on Google because I'm not the person answers.</v>

954
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>And also I don't think they've totally confirmed it yet.</v>

955
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people are still saying that there's a high likelihood for some</v>

956
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:07.300
<v Speaker 2>kind of error and they experiment a course and while everybody's going to say</v>

957
00:26:07.301 --> 00:26:08.950
<v Speaker 2>that anyone when something that crazy,</v>

958
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.720
<v Speaker 2>you know when someone says,</v>

959
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>oh I figured out the time traveling bitch,</v>

960
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.380
<v Speaker 2>figure out how can we see your papers.</v>

961
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.320
<v Speaker 2>He didn't feel at that time she was a bitch.</v>

962
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:16.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

963
00:26:16.691 --> 00:26:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about time travel.</v>

964
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 2>If there really was a time traveler then they could follow somebody by walking</v>

965
00:26:22.991 --> 00:26:23.824
<v Speaker 2>in front of them.</v>

966
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.383
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

967
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

968
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.583
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

969
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.610
<v Speaker 2>cause you would know where they were going already so you could walk in front of</v>

970
00:26:30.611 --> 00:26:31.600
<v Speaker 2>them on whatever.</v>

971
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:35.070
<v Speaker 2>We would have to have like a really fucking detailed list of all the shifts</v>

972
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:36.010
<v Speaker 2>that's already gone down.</v>

973
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.820
<v Speaker 2>You have to see it,</v>

974
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to send a time pro back first to like watch and watch the whole</v>

975
00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:40.930
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

976
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Observe whoever you want it to run out of time would die.</v>

977
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.540
<v Speaker 2>You die of old age.</v>

978
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

979
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.653
<v Speaker 2>If you want it,</v>

980
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you could send,</v>

981
00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.291
<v Speaker 2>you could like,</v>

982
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:49.441
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

983
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:49.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

984
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to observe like Thomas Jefferson or something.</v>

985
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

986
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.371
<v Speaker 2>What'd you be?</v>

987
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

988
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

989
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

990
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.450
<v Speaker 2>To get real videos of the founding fathers.</v>

991
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Who would you go to if you had,</v>

992
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>if you had a just an open ticket back in time?</v>

993
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Clearly the first person I visited,</v>

994
00:27:04.901 --> 00:27:05.740
<v Speaker 2>his Jesus,</v>

995
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

996
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.083
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

997
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus or Buddha or Jesus or Buddha.</v>

998
00:27:10.071 --> 00:27:11.330
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough choice.</v>

999
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:11.991
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1000
00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:12.131
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1001
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1002
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I know the first human,</v>

1003
00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I want to visit the first human,</v>

1004
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

1005
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.420
<v Speaker 1>the first human you'd want to see cave men on the field.</v>

1006
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:20.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:27:20.891 --> 00:27:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that if,</v>

1008
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I had to have a bunch of chances,</v>

1009
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:23.331
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1010
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:24.880
<v Speaker 2>that's the first thing I'd like to see.</v>

1011
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Then I move up to Buddha</v>

1012
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.221
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1013
00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:29.054
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>

1014
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.953
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1015
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:30.441
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1016
00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:30.890
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1017
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.723
<v Speaker 1>here's what it is.</v>

1018
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.050
<v Speaker 1>The research clearly shows that when a total of 15,000 beams of neutrinos were</v>

1019
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:36.830
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>

1020
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.270
<v Speaker 1>the tiny particles traveled,</v>

1021
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the 730 kilometer,</v>

1022
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.090
<v Speaker 1>2.43 millisecond trip,</v>

1023
00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:46.910
<v Speaker 1>roughly 60 nano seconds faster than light.</v>

1024
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.943
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1025
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.091
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

1026
00:27:50.091 --> 00:27:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Because that,</v>

1027
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.111
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1028
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:51.944
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

1029
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.813
<v Speaker 1>that's period.</v>

1030
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1031
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they think so.</v>

1032
00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:56.570
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1033
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:27:56.711 --> 00:27:57.410
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1035
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.440
<v Speaker 1>By saying that this is Soren that's putting this out,</v>

1037
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.461
<v Speaker 1>so that's it.</v>

1038
00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1039
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 1>so they'll know Cerner's folks CRM,</v>

1040
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.581
<v Speaker 1>look it up.</v>

1041
00:28:04.581 --> 00:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's still the people that are responsible for the large Hadron collider,</v>

1042
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:08.650
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

1043
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.870
<v Speaker 1>the craziest scientific experiment ever that's going on right now.</v>

1044
00:28:11.871 --> 00:28:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's in Switzerland,</v>

1045
00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1046
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1047
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.010
<v Speaker 1>From Sweden underground.</v>

1048
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Fucking incredible gigantic particle collider that is supposed to uncover this</v>

1049
00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:22.810
<v Speaker 1>thing called the Higgs Boson particle,</v>

1050
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:23.560
<v Speaker 1>which they call a,</v>

1051
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me,</v>

1052
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.390
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

1053
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and people have corrected me on that.</v>

1054
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1055
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.681
<v Speaker 1>my apologies.</v>

1056
00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Boson the God particle.</v>

1057
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.290
<v Speaker 1>But now they're saying that it's 95% sure that it doesn't exist.</v>

1059
00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.813
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1061
00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>

1062
00:28:34.601 --> 00:28:34.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1063
00:28:34.991 --> 00:28:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you imagine that they built this gigantic fucking billion dollars when they</v>

1064
00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.760
<v Speaker 1>obviously finding out a bunch of other shit.</v>

1065
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll take time traveler or some stupid particle.</v>

1066
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Well who knows what that particle means.</v>

1067
00:28:44.471 --> 00:28:47.920
<v Speaker 1>They did create that cork glue on plasma shit.</v>

1068
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1069
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's one sugar cube was like 400 billion pounds or something fucking</v>

1070
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:54.964
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1071
00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:55.960
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it was.</v>

1072
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.080
<v Speaker 1>They created some incredibly negligent will amount,</v>

1073
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:28:59.321 --> 00:28:59.861
<v Speaker 1>some tiny,</v>

1075
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:00.694
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

1076
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1077
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't want a lot of that shit.</v>

1078
00:29:02.561 --> 00:29:03.394
<v Speaker 1>Lanner right.</v>

1079
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you imagine if they made like a marble sized chocolate?</v>

1080
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It just dropped the earth</v>

1081
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.960
<v Speaker 1>just shot right into the water and core like water.</v>

1082
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:17.080
<v Speaker 1>The earth would just be like a big droplet of water.</v>

1083
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1084
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much weight it would take for that to happen.</v>

1085
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.353
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1086
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>If you had a bowling ball full of this Gwar glue on Yasma Shit.</v>

1087
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.180
<v Speaker 1>That shit would just go right through the right to the earth of bowling ball</v>

1089
00:29:31.181 --> 00:29:33.040
<v Speaker 1>would have to be some insane amount of weight.</v>

1090
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:33.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:34.564
<v Speaker 2>it would be.</v>

1092
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1093
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.261
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1094
00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the weight would be.</v>

1095
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Someone should,</v>

1096
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.253
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1097
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 1>had around something.</v>

1098
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 1>There's that dense,</v>

1099
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 1>think like a fat person and you look at it like,</v>

1100
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>

1101
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1102
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 1>fat James from the container store or fat James Lovelock chain is a great guy.</v>

1103
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Calls himself fat James Fox.</v>

1104
00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We got off.</v>

1105
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1106
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.973
<v Speaker 1>it's his nickname.</v>

1107
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It's Fred James calls you up.</v>

1108
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.651
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1109
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>it's Fred James.</v>

1110
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1111
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1112
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.970
<v Speaker 1>so you think about him as a human easy,</v>

1113
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>not a tall fellow,</v>

1114
00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but he's fairly heavy and you look at it,</v>

1115
00:29:59.911 --> 00:30:00.041
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>

1116
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1117
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:00.851
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1118
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:02.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of weight right there.</v>

1119
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:02.770
<v Speaker 1>That's wonderful.</v>

1120
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Now think about if he was a cork glue on plasma,</v>

1121
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.651
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1122
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1123
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 1>even wrap your head around that.</v>

1124
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.540
<v Speaker 1>A sugar cube is 40 billion or 400 billion fucking pounds over the hell.</v>

1126
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Whatever insane mean when you say 40 billion,</v>

1128
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.271
<v Speaker 1>400 billion.</v>

1129
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's,</v>

1130
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference in those two numbers,</v>

1131
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but to me,</v>

1132
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>none of them even register.</v>

1133
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making noises with my mouth.</v>

1134
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1135
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1136
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 1>40 billion means or 400 billion means.</v>

1137
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.661
<v Speaker 1>That to me is like,</v>

1138
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 1>it's too abstract.</v>

1139
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:30.544
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>

1140
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not assimilating that.</v>

1141
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1142
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 1>but to think about fat James made out of this stuff,</v>

1143
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't even like,</v>

1144
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 1>how is that even possible that it could be two types of matter that are both</v>

1145
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:45.751
<v Speaker 1>some the so far different from each other that they could be the same size and</v>

1146
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.700
<v Speaker 1>one of them would be literally the weight of the fucking earth.</v>

1147
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Probably not that way.</v>

1148
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:50.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:51.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1150
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 2>it's insane to think about that and it's insane to think that these people are</v>

1151
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 2>down there tinkering around under Switzerland trying to make this shit.</v>

1152
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what this is creepy.</v>

1153
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Well they make only a little tiny amounts of it.</v>

1154
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:01.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1155
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:01.830
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

1156
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.090
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1157
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.520
<v Speaker 1>they've got a great sense of humor about it.</v>

1158
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:03.840
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1159
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 1>they dress up like the life dude's and they've like take pictures of them</v>

1160
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:09.350
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be the characters and halflife.</v>

1161
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Cause we don't know that the video game half life was all about scientists</v>

1163
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 1>cracking a hole in the universe and the aliens come over.</v>

1164
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.374
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everybody up.</v>

1165
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Awesome game.</v>

1166
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>What an awesome game that is.</v>

1167
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.851
<v Speaker 2>But dude,</v>

1168
00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I like to think about,</v>

1169
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.580
<v Speaker 2>one thing I like to think of APP is the large Hadron collider accident.</v>

1170
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Like what it would look like and like the way I see it,</v>

1171
00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:29.420
<v Speaker 2>it goes like this.</v>

1172
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:29.961
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1173
00:31:29.961 --> 00:31:30.950
<v Speaker 2>you're on the Internet,</v>

1174
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you look on wherever you go,</v>

1175
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.440
<v Speaker 2>CNN and it says fire large Hadron collider.</v>

1176
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing you see and you're like,</v>

1177
00:31:38.241 --> 00:31:39.021
<v Speaker 2>God that sucks.</v>

1178
00:31:39.021 --> 00:31:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Now there was an explosion underground.</v>

1179
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.050
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1180
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Then like five minutes later it's like this fire is spreading like no fire we've</v>

1181
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:46.670
<v Speaker 2>ever seen before.</v>

1182
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Like the fires just all of a sudden just racing through Switzerland.</v>

1183
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.240
<v Speaker 2>No one understands why it's spreading that fastener and like what the fuck?</v>

1184
00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.670
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing you think is what's that?</v>

1185
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.740
<v Speaker 2>You're just gone.</v>

1186
00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Cause this fucking energy beam is shot around the planet and like a millisecond</v>

1187
00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:04.400
<v Speaker 2>just wiped everything out.</v>

1188
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1189
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that's how I know I've eaten too much pot.</v>

1190
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause inevitably my mind will start going to the large,</v>

1191
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.071
<v Speaker 2>I'll start getting,</v>

1192
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:12.410
<v Speaker 2>getting nervous about the large Hadron collider.</v>

1193
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Have you eaten too much pot today?</v>

1194
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.360
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1195
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 2>You're okay?</v>

1196
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Totally fine.</v>

1197
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Totally fine.</v>

1198
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.780
<v Speaker 2>How much of that Cook you take?</v>

1199
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:18.711
<v Speaker 2>Just a crumb.</v>

1200
00:32:18.711 --> 00:32:19.544
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even open.</v>

1201
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1202
00:32:19.881 --> 00:32:20.714
<v Speaker 2>I took a crumb.</v>

1203
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Good move.</v>

1204
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:21.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:32:21.801 --> 00:32:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1206
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.331
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1207
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1208
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I've fucked up so many times.</v>

1209
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1211
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% for marijuana legalization,</v>

1212
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think you should at least have to read a book or watch a documentary</v>

1213
00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1214
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Eat one of those cookies.</v>

1215
00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1216
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck you again,</v>

1217
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I could eat a cookie.</v>

1218
00:32:36.601 --> 00:32:37.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just a cookie.</v>

1219
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:38.970
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

1220
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat the whole</v>

1221
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.840
<v Speaker 1>cookie.</v>

1222
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Those cookies are crippling sometimes.</v>

1223
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.181
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1224
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:44.871
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't know what,</v>

1225
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

1226
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no standard dose.</v>

1227
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Like when you get a cookie and it says two x,</v>

1228
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

1229
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1230
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:51.561
<v Speaker 1>two doses.</v>

1231
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Two doses for who to x is three x is,</v>

1232
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this fucking,</v>

1233
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 1>you're using a porn system for this shit.</v>

1234
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 1>You're using the porn rating system.</v>

1235
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.931
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1236
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:00.764
<v Speaker 1>I had a one,</v>

1237
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>a one bite of a very small cookie.</v>

1238
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:05.770
<v Speaker 1>This cookie was only like the size of us.</v>

1239
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Not even just slightly larger than a quarter.</v>

1240
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1241
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a small cookie.</v>

1242
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I took a little bite out of it.</v>

1243
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.901
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1244
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 1>let's just be careful.</v>

1245
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a little bite out of it.</v>

1246
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 1>An hour later,</v>

1247
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:16.671
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

1248
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>my whole body was tangling.</v>

1249
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to just lie down on the carpet and make like carpet angels.</v>

1250
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I was lit screen.</v>

1251
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean roaring,</v>

1252
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 1>roaring through the tunnels of reality clinging to the earth as it spins a</v>

1253
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 1>thousand miles an hour.</v>

1254
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.173
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1255
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>all I could think of is what the fuck would happen if I took that whole cookie.</v>

1256
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even keep my eyes.</v>

1257
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.200
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

1258
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>

1259
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:43.341
<v Speaker 1>I was just sitting.</v>

1260
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like cuddling with myself on the couch.</v>

1261
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I was blasted.</v>

1262
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.521
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1263
00:33:49.521 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 1>the phone rang and I picked up the phone.</v>

1264
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

1265
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a buddy line.</v>

1266
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1267
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 1>what's up dude?</v>

1268
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1269
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:54.494
<v Speaker 1>everything's cool,</v>

1270
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1271
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.271
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1273
00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:56.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

1274
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting some writing done.</v>

1275
00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:58.731
<v Speaker 1>All right man.</v>

1276
00:33:58.731 --> 00:33:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you a bye.</v>

1277
00:33:59.571 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Click.</v>

1278
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh right back into it.</v>

1279
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I could talk on the phone like I,</v>

1280
00:34:03.091 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

1281
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.371
<v Speaker 1>I could be okay.</v>

1282
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:05.204
<v Speaker 1>I was functioning.</v>

1283
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1284
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:06.471
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking,</v>

1285
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>what if I took that whole fucking cookie?</v>

1286
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1287
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:10.211
<v Speaker 2>That's funny though.</v>

1289
00:34:10.211 --> 00:34:12.550
<v Speaker 2>That thing you just said about how that part of your mind,</v>

1290
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:17.170
<v Speaker 2>the part of your mind that like clicks back into know like no matter how deep</v>

1291
00:34:17.171 --> 00:34:20.770
<v Speaker 2>the psychedelic experiences there is a party puts a flashlight in your eyes.</v>

1292
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1293
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:21.881
<v Speaker 2>Like dude,</v>

1294
00:34:21.881 --> 00:34:22.714
<v Speaker 2>we're cool.</v>

1295
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.063
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

1296
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange how your mind can do that no matter how far out you get.</v>

1298
00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:28.840
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1299
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1300
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a curiosity.</v>

1301
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a story about the ROM DASS talks about this lady car them cause she</v>

1302
00:34:34.841 --> 00:34:36.490
<v Speaker 2>was on orange sunshine,</v>

1303
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:40.570
<v Speaker 2>which was apparently back in the 60s it was like the ultimate LSD.</v>

1304
00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It was like this legendary acid.</v>

1305
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.720
<v Speaker 2>And she called him and said,</v>

1306
00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:47.554
<v Speaker 2>you know I've,</v>

1307
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1308
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you know I've gone,</v>

1309
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I've took too much orange sunshine.</v>

1310
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going completely insane.</v>

1311
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

1312
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.693
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1313
00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.360
<v Speaker 2>okay well can you put the person on who thought that they should call me and</v>

1314
00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 2>pick up the phone and dialed it cause that's who I want to talk to you right</v>

1315
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:04.780
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1316
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like her,</v>

1317
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:09.250
<v Speaker 2>she was a logical enough to not to dial a phone and call and talk.</v>

1318
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.110
<v Speaker 2>She was making logical decisions.</v>

1319
00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.640
<v Speaker 2>She had just decided to allow herself to be the crazy person for a second.</v>

1320
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1321
00:35:16.271 --> 00:35:16.900
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>

1322
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.410
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1323
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying is it's like there's always the observer.</v>

1324
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.630
<v Speaker 2>There's always the part of yourself that's watching you go into whatever or the</v>

1325
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:27.400
<v Speaker 2>experiences that you're going into,</v>

1326
00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:30.160
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a psychedelic experience,</v>

1327
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:32.110
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a traumatic life experience,</v>

1328
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.510
<v Speaker 2>there's always the part of you that's just kind of watching.</v>

1329
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on who you want to identify with it at any given,</v>

1330
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1331
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:38.461
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1332
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:39.181
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1333
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:40.014
<v Speaker 2>when you get angry,</v>

1334
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.390
<v Speaker 1>easier said than done though.</v>

1335
00:35:41.391 --> 00:35:43.580
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about someone going on a bad trip.</v>

1336
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Because when you go on a bad trip,</v>

1337
00:35:45.561 --> 00:35:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you could feel utterly helpless.</v>

1338
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1339
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.200
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing about psychedelics is that you have to,</v>

1340
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to release yourself to them.</v>

1341
00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:56.000
<v Speaker 1>You must submit in order to take in the experience correctly,</v>

1342
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got to submit or you got to take doses where you have no choice.</v>

1343
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1344
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:00.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1345
00:36:00.531 --> 00:36:01.100
<v Speaker 1>and those are,</v>

1346
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:01.933
<v Speaker 2>that's better.</v>

1347
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I know you said that was awesome,</v>

1348
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:10.271
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1349
00:36:10.271 --> 00:36:10.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1350
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>it is you that was as honest as you could have been.</v>

1351
00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1352
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a better thing because when you have to surrender that involves like this</v>

1353
00:36:17.181 --> 00:36:18.140
<v Speaker 2>choice to die,</v>

1354
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's still,</v>

1355
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:22.190
<v Speaker 2>the bad trips occur and the reason why the bad trips occurs because you're</v>

1356
00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:22.611
<v Speaker 2>fighting it,</v>

1357
00:36:22.611 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1358
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1360
00:36:23.961 --> 00:36:24.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1361
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are bad trips can occur for a lot of different reasons.</v>

1362
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1363
00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1364
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.210
<v Speaker 2>It's quite often it's ego death.</v>

1365
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.990
<v Speaker 2>You're desperately trying to keep yourself from blinking out of existence.</v>

1366
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1367
00:36:33.411 --> 00:36:33.980
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

1368
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.060
<v Speaker 2>your ego kicks in and does the exact same thing that happens when someone's</v>

1369
00:36:38.061 --> 00:36:38.770
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

1370
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1371
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:39.783
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

1372
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to you then that you know,</v>

1373
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you would be feeling like you're going crazy and to be terrified.</v>

1374
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

1375
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1376
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it the,</v>

1377
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 1>isn't the real problem that there's no one to guide people on these experiences?</v>

1378
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:51.751
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1379
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:56.751
<v Speaker 1>Like really seasoned professionals that measure the dose in a clinical setting</v>

1380
00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:58.561
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1381
00:36:58.561 --> 00:36:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1382
00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1383
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine how much help people could get from that sort of an</v>

1384
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.380
<v Speaker 1>environment?</v>

1385
00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:05.681
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1386
00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you've helped me.</v>

1387
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to you on the phone when I'm way too high and you've inevitably made</v>

1388
00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:12.040
<v Speaker 2>me feel better just from like talking to you,</v>

1389
00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 2>cause I'll call it out if I'm freaking out.</v>

1390
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the specific time,</v>

1391
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:22.020
<v Speaker 2>but I know that I've called you and just started talking about some terrible</v>

1392
00:37:22.391 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 2>idea I'd have about an imminent war.</v>

1393
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Something like some awful thing.</v>

1394
00:37:26.951 --> 00:37:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting paranoid about it and you're really good at being like,</v>

1395
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to happen.</v>

1396
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.440
<v Speaker 2>You're fine that everything's fine.</v>

1397
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And it just takes that it's just one confident person and be like,</v>

1398
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.491
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1399
00:37:36.491 --> 00:37:37.720
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to be really great.</v>

1400
00:37:37.721 --> 00:37:40.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about anything and you'll feel better.</v>

1401
00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:40.781
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1402
00:37:40.781 --> 00:37:41.141
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1403
00:37:41.141 --> 00:37:42.430
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be these people.</v>

1404
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Especially that's not right.</v>

1405
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Not even</v>

1406
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.270
<v Speaker 1>someone you know who knows what they're doing.</v>

1407
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That's just a friend you just called up a friend and seem normal.</v>

1408
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.690
<v Speaker 1>But if you were getting dosed up by a professional,</v>

1409
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.381
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1410
00:37:53.381 --> 00:37:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Because I think,</v>

1411
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.401
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1412
00:37:54.401 --> 00:37:54.881
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1413
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I do think that everything should be legal.</v>

1414
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:57.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1415
00:37:57.041 --> 00:38:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I think there's horrible consequences to make crack and heroin illegal.</v>

1416
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to keep those illegal,</v>

1417
00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:03.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1418
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:03.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1419
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna fight you.</v>

1420
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fight your own math.</v>

1421
00:38:05.621 --> 00:38:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to find,</v>

1422
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it should be easy to get math.</v>

1423
00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think the people make math for sure.</v>

1424
00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You should fucking put them in a cage.</v>

1425
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:12.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1427
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.331
<v Speaker 1>some asshole.</v>

1428
00:38:13.331 --> 00:38:13.511
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1429
00:38:13.511 --> 00:38:14.380
<v Speaker 1>it gives someone addictive,</v>

1430
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.490
<v Speaker 1>some horrible fucking chemical that's from cold syrup and shit and it just</v>

1431
00:38:18.491 --> 00:38:20.320
<v Speaker 1>completely fucks your world up.</v>

1432
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.420
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to other stuff,</v>

1433
00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:27.421
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like mushrooms or Iowasca or all these,</v>

1434
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.870
<v Speaker 1>these things have to be released to the public.</v>

1435
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1436
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.633
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

1437
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 1>if they don't get released to public,</v>

1438
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 1>society suffers.</v>

1439
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Society is more lost.</v>

1440
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Society is a less introspective is more plumper.</v>

1441
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Prone to patterns.</v>

1442
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1443
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:45.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like closing the library.</v>

1444
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:46.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a type of library.</v>

1445
00:38:46.651 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>You're not like letting people into not just a library,</v>

1446
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps a,</v>

1447
00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>a source of inspiration,</v>

1448
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:54.161
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge,</v>

1449
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:54.761
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom.</v>

1450
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:56.740
<v Speaker 1>It might even be another fucking life form.</v>

1451
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1452
00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:57.491
<v Speaker 1>so many,</v>

1453
00:38:57.491 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1454
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1455
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.370
<v Speaker 1>corrected me on Twitter the other day about something,</v>

1456
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.700
<v Speaker 1>but we were talking about mushrooms being plants and it was like actually</v>

1457
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.140
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

1458
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:04.781
<v Speaker 1>not a plan.</v>

1459
00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:05.501
<v Speaker 1>It's a fungus.</v>

1460
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different lights.</v>

1461
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.593
<v Speaker 1>Life source,</v>

1462
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:08.171
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1463
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:08.951
<v Speaker 1>Its own kingdom.</v>

1464
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 1>It's its own kingdom.</v>

1465
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

1466
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:11.281
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1467
00:39:11.281 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 1>they're closer to animals than they are to plants.</v>

1468
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.340
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1469
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:15.971
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1470
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:19.390
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about a giant super organisms,</v>

1471
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the whole Pacific northwest,</v>

1472
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.850
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's some giant mushroom colony and the Pacific northwest,</v>

1473
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:27.940
<v Speaker 1>it's all considered,</v>

1474
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:28.931
<v Speaker 1>it's under the,</v>

1476
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 1>it's mycelium or whatever the fuck it is considered one large organism and it's</v>

1477
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:34.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest organisms on the,</v>

1478
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

1479
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking sperm whale of mushrooms.</v>

1480
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bigger than a sperm.</v>

1481
00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:40.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1482
00:39:40.721 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's you like,</v>

1483
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:42.611
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1484
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:44.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't that miles or something?</v>

1485
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>

1486
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:47.440
<v Speaker 1>But it is a life form.</v>

1487
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And Mckenna had this rap about mushrooms that,</v>

1488
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1489
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 1>not only did he think that mushrooms were the catalysts for humans evolving from</v>

1490
00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 1>lower primates,</v>

1491
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but he also thought that mushrooms came from of their planet because the,</v>

1492
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>because the fact that spores could survive in a vacuum and it's structure of a,</v>

1493
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.200
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

1494
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.621
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

1495
00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 1>five p there's a,</v>

1496
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it's called a Fox for a [inaudible] and dimethyl trip and he said something like</v>

1497
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 1>something about that phosphorous or positions,</v>

1498
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.880
<v Speaker 1>the only one like it on the planet.</v>

1499
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like that mushroom and the planet.</v>

1500
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And yet it mimics human neuro chemistry.</v>

1501
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1502
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1503
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.280
<v Speaker 1>and dimethyltryptamine is produced in the human body and the,</v>

1504
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's in the blood brain barrier and they think it's responsible for dreams</v>

1505
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit.</v>

1506
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 1>And this stuff has it in it.</v>

1507
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>

1508
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.090
<v Speaker 1>that is part of what it is.</v>

1509
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And if it really did come from another planet,</v>

1510
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you know,</v>

1511
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>all of our ideas about intelligent life are based on the above,</v>

1512
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manipulate carbon,</v>

1513
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.390
<v Speaker 1>to build the ability to manipulate carbon matter.</v>

1514
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.480
<v Speaker 1>But what if a mushroom is a life form that has evolved so far that it doesn't</v>

1515
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>need a form anymore.</v>

1516
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to move and the way it gets you as you eat it and you can't kill</v>

1517
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:01.061
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1518
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:06.061
<v Speaker 1>it fucking fly through space on an asteroid gets knocked off of one pat planet</v>

1519
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and travels 4 billion light years to another one and lands there,</v>

1520
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1521
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and it starts up a new fucking colony and mushrooms and they grow and they grow</v>

1522
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.190
<v Speaker 1>where people are.</v>

1523
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't grow in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1524
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.770
<v Speaker 1>They're not hard to find.</v>

1525
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>They're on grass lawns.</v>

1526
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Lawns were people who always are.</v>

1527
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They're always around people,</v>

1528
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1529
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.371
<v Speaker 1>There's people,</v>

1530
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 1>there's mushrooms.</v>

1531
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>

1532
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>

1533
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.330
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's a life form a life form from another planet that came in on</v>

1534
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:34.350
<v Speaker 1>an asteroid and that that's how theory of Panspermia that,</v>

1535
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 1>that that's how life is seated throughout the unit.</v>

1536
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.513
<v Speaker 1>What's the word?</v>

1537
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Penn spirit.</v>

1538
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:39.403
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1539
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1540
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the universe is seeded by asteroid impacts hitting planets and</v>

1541
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 1>knocking off,</v>

1542
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1543
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1544
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:47.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1545
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>amino acids and the building blocks of life and in somehow or another,</v>

1546
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a chemical reaction with another plan and also comments carrying</v>

1547
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.660
<v Speaker 1>water and the water comes and in life is,</v>

1548
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1549
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1550
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 1>and it goes from one planet to the other and that's the idea is we're seated by</v>

1551
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:02.864
<v Speaker 1>asteroids.</v>

1552
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1553
00:42:03.731 --> 00:42:04.030
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1554
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1555
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>that idea I've heard,</v>

1556
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I've heard Mccain has idea and it,</v>

1557
00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.820
<v Speaker 2>and when you're tripping,</v>

1558
00:42:09.821 --> 00:42:14.821
<v Speaker 2>it definitely does seem like you are getting some kind of transmission from</v>

1559
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.170
<v Speaker 2>something you're getting.</v>

1560
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1561
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1562
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.450
<v Speaker 1>not even a transmission to me.</v>

1563
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 1>To me when I'm really gone,</v>

1564
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it feels like I'm in something or I'm a part of it,</v>

1565
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:24.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1566
00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:24.811
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1567
00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:25.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1568
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not a transmission.</v>

1569
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1570
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 1>in this amount,</v>

1571
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.010
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1572
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever your consciousness truly is outside of cells and fingernails,</v>

1573
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.130
<v Speaker 1>whenever your,</v>

1574
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:35.431
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1575
00:42:35.431 --> 00:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>your inner consciousness is,</v>

1576
00:42:36.841 --> 00:42:40.140
<v Speaker 1>this thing took me to another place.</v>

1577
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the physical body that I exist to move around,</v>

1578
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it literally didn't exist and I was inside this other place.</v>

1579
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It's an experience that's not like,</v>

1580
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a transmission,</v>

1581
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.030
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like more like a chemical gateway feeling.</v>

1583
00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:54.661
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1584
00:42:54.661 --> 00:42:57.400
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this before the podcast that it could just be your sense is</v>

1585
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking with you when you're whacked out on drugs.</v>

1586
00:42:59.161 --> 00:42:59.994
<v Speaker 1>It big.</v>

1587
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It could be that your senses,</v>

1588
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 1>everybody sends his work the same way.</v>

1589
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You take this whacked out drug and everybody gets a reaction the same way.</v>

1590
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.380
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it is.</v>

1591
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1592
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.120
<v Speaker 1>and even if it is,</v>

1593
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it's more fun to think that it's not and there's no evidence to prove</v>

1594
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.073
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1595
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.200
<v Speaker 2>facts,</v>

1596
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.900
<v Speaker 2>stick with it because it's more empowering.</v>

1597
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.763
<v Speaker 2>It's more fascinating.</v>

1598
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I like to believe in magic.</v>

1599
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:18.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1600
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to believe in too much magic,</v>

1601
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 1>but I like to believe that mushrooms are magic.</v>

1602
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I like to believe that DMTs magic.</v>

1603
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I like to believe that the wheat is magic.</v>

1604
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.201
<v Speaker 1>I really believe we,</v>

1605
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:28.034
<v Speaker 1>it is magic.</v>

1606
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It sounds stupid,</v>

1607
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.134
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

1608
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1609
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about it in a silly,</v>

1610
00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian way,</v>

1611
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's functional and easy to use without delving too deeply into what</v>

1612
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the wheat is.</v>

1613
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.380
<v Speaker 1>When I smoke weed,</v>

1614
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.030
<v Speaker 1>all the sudden I get ideas.</v>

1615
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I smoke weed and it's shit.</v>

1616
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1617
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I have ideas.</v>

1618
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1619
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 1>If that's not magic,</v>

1620
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is.</v>

1621
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.680
<v Speaker 1>All things come to you from the burning of a plant.</v>

1622
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.761
<v Speaker 1>He burned a plant.</v>

1623
00:43:52.761 --> 00:43:53.720
<v Speaker 1>You take in its essence,</v>

1624
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.993
<v Speaker 1>west</v>

1625
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.330
<v Speaker 1>introspective thoughts.</v>

1626
00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Start worrying about your own behavior,</v>

1627
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>studying yourself,</v>

1628
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:04.190
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world differently,</v>

1629
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:05.024
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

1630
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.923
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:08.840
<v Speaker 1>they're just floating above us.</v>

1634
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>There's moisture in them,</v>

1635
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1636
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.721
<v Speaker 2>Where's that coming from?</v>

1637
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Mad.</v>

1638
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.810
<v Speaker 2>That's your brain cells done.</v>

1644
00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the first time your brain cells are dying.</v>

1645
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:20.620
<v Speaker 2>As you start adding brilliant thoughts,</v>

1646
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you remember that and this is your brain on drugs,</v>

1647
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.450
<v Speaker 2>the the Ag love at any point in time to get high and debate that Guy,</v>

1648
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.410
<v Speaker 2>the Warren drive,</v>

1649
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>that commercial guy.</v>

1650
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>No nonsense guy.</v>

1651
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1652
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.963
<v Speaker 1>this is your brain.</v>

1653
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.440
<v Speaker 1>This is your brain onto a bill.</v>

1654
00:44:36.441 --> 00:44:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Hicks had a great bit about,</v>

1655
00:44:37.311 --> 00:44:37.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1656
00:44:37.521 --> 00:44:39.680
<v Speaker 1>every comic at the time had a great panel about that.</v>

1657
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks had a particularly brilliant one about that,</v>

1658
00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but how preposterous it was.</v>

1659
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1660
00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:44.840
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1661
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you remember those commercials that came on after nine 11 where a guy was a no</v>

1662
00:44:49.101 --> 00:44:52.790
<v Speaker 1>nonsense guy in a steakhouse with a suit on eating a salad.</v>

1663
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And his friend was like the silly man and his friend were like,</v>

1664

00:44:56.871 --> 00:44:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell me that.</v>

1666
00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1667
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.140
<v Speaker 1>if I smoke pot,</v>

1668
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm supporting terrorism.</v>

1669
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.983
<v Speaker 1>Yes I can.</v>

1670

<v Speaker 1>And he's eating,</v>

1671
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.400
<v Speaker 1>eating the lettuce.</v>

1672
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.233
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

1673
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.913
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

1674
00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.413
<v Speaker 1>That's a drag show.</v>

1675
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Like a no nonsense man with his suit on.</v>

1676
00:45:11.771 --> 00:45:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating a salad.</v>

1677
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you right now,</v>

1678
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.020
<v Speaker 2>most of the drugs that use or put terrorism,</v>

1679
00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.490
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>

1680
00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:19.540
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

1681
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 1>they're the most retarded.</v>

1682
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.370
<v Speaker 1>There's no logic to them.</v>

1683
00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 1>The appeal to the weakest of emotions,</v>

1684
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the desire to be this fat douchebag eating a steak salad,</v>

1685
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:29.510
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1691
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.370
<v Speaker 2>He's a disciplined business man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cause it's true.</v>

1693
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Taking any nonsense,</v>

1694
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Speaker 2>you know it's fucking tree.</v>

1698
00:45:44.861 --> 00:45:46.030

1704
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.240
<v Speaker 2>they're calling the white collar police and the blue collar police.</v>

1705
00:46:01.241 --> 00:46:04.840
<v Speaker 2>The guys in the blue suits are apparently just being policed and they're cool,</v>

1706
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're these violent kind of like a thug pigs out there who have been like</v>

1707
00:46:10.571 --> 00:46:11.750
<v Speaker 2>grabbing people.</v>

1708
00:46:11.751 --> 00:46:13.000
<v Speaker 2>You weren't doing anything.</v>

1709

1719
00:46:24.501 --> 00:46:25.570

<v Speaker 2>and then try to sneak away.</v>

1735
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.020
<v Speaker 2>They got a picture of the son of a bitch.</v>

1736
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.800
<v Speaker 2>It's on,</v>

1737
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.633
<v Speaker 2>you can look at,</v>

1738
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.750
<v Speaker 2>what's the name of that thing?</v>

1739
00:46:44.751 --> 00:46:46.130
<v Speaker 2>It's occupy Wall Street.</v>

1740
00:46:46.131 --> 00:46:46.964
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's called?</v>

1741
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1742
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.201
<v Speaker 2>On that site,</v>

1743
00:46:48.201 --> 00:46:51.560
<v Speaker 2>occupy Wall street.org I think there's a picture of the guy.</v>

1744
00:46:51.561 --> 00:46:54.350
<v Speaker 2>They got a picture of him and they're trying to find them because they've got</v>

1745
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:58.340
<v Speaker 2>lawyers who are volunteering to help the people get out of jail and help the</v>

1746
00:46:58.341 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 2>people who are like,</v>

1747
00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.980
<v Speaker 2>they've already arrested at a hundred people</v>

1748
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:02.861
<v Speaker 1>and what are they doing?</v>

1749
00:47:02.861 --> 00:47:03.820
<v Speaker 1>They're protesting what?</v>

1750
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.640
<v Speaker 2>See that's they're protesting.</v>

1751
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:09.120
<v Speaker 2>The idea is they're protesting the fact that 1% of the people on the planet</v>

1752
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 2>control the resources and they're going to Wall Street because that's a,</v>

1753
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.790
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be like the locus of all this,</v>

1754
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 2>like a greed.</v>

1755
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.160
<v Speaker 2>There's great video.</v>

1756
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:21.330
<v Speaker 2>There's video of like these really like rich people sitting out on the balcony</v>

1757
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:26.331
<v Speaker 2>drinking champagne and toasting the protest or all these like Super Richie rich</v>

1758
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 2>is out there just to watch and I'm like,</v>

1759
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 2>they're like fucking with them.</v>

1760
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1761
00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Kinda really?</v>

1762
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:31.234
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1763
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1764
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:31.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1765
00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 2>like there are novelty.</v>

1766
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like look,</v>

1767
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 2>oh look at the protesters.</v>

1768
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:36.610
<v Speaker 2>What I keep hearing,</v>

1769
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing that no one's covering this in the mainstream news.</v>

1770
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.681
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing that.</v>

1771
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 2>But then I'm looking@bloomberg.com and it's on there.</v>

1772
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's on business insider.</v>

1773
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I think they've started covering,</v>

1774
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 2>covering like they have to because people are starting to get arrested.</v>

1775
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1776
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:51.910
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1777
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1778
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.570
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know the real number of people that,</v>

1779
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>that are out there right now.</v>

1780
00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I would love to,</v>

1781
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 2>and this is fascinating.</v>

1782
00:47:58.871 --> 00:47:59.980
<v Speaker 2>This is a new movement.</v>

1783
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1784
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's happening right now.</v>

1785
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:02.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1786
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:02.441
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1787
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:03.251
<v Speaker 2>if you're in New York,</v>

1788
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:03.881
<v Speaker 2>you could go down there.</v>

1789
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm bringing him a sandwich cause they gotta be hungry,</v>

1790
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:07.151
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1791
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:07.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these kids,</v>

1792
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 2>they don't look like they don't.</v>

1793
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>They've been out there for eight days.</v>

1794
00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Nearly a hundred people have been arrested for protesting in and around Wall</v>

1795
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:14.051
<v Speaker 2>Street during what?</v>

1796
00:48:14.051 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Some are calling the Arab spring of the United States.</v>

1797
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:18.521
<v Speaker 2>Outraged.</v>

1798
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1799
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

1800
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I know you think about what's going on.</v>

1801
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>These Arab countries outrage over the way that the political and financial</v>

1802
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.441
<v Speaker 2>worlds are managed.</v>

1803
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Protesters calling themselves in 99% of gathered to share their grievances with</v>

1804
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 2>the top 1% of America and demand change.</v>

1805
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1806
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why it's illegal to protest.</v>

1807
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I thought protesting was always legal.</v>

1808
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Is it your,</v>

1809
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a permit to protest and that these people don't have permits?</v>

1810
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1811
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that they,</v>

1812
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:48.950
<v Speaker 2>they did get per,</v>

1813
00:48:48.951 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1814
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1815
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised if there was like they didn't have a permit.</v>

1816
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Seems gross that you should need to get permission to protest.</v>

1817
00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there should be some sort of a right,</v>

1818
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if you should be able to do it on someone's property.</v>

1819
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're blocking them fucking traffic.</v>

1820
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.250
<v Speaker 2>That shit's annoying mean.</v>

1822
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1823
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 2>It does seem to go counter to the idea of a protest,</v>

1824
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

1825
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 2>can I have your permission to protest?</v>

1826
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 2>You're just supposed to protest.</v>

1827
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:10.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1828
00:49:10.691 --> 00:49:10.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1829
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:11.261
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1830
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:12.410
<v Speaker 2>it's something I,</v>

1831
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I support them.</v>

1833
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.190
<v Speaker 2>They're doing something,</v>

1834
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:15.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1835
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:15.631
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1836
00:49:15.631 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>they're out there beating the drum.</v>

1837
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:17.780
<v Speaker 2>They're letting everybody know,</v>

1838
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1839
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:18.311
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1840
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 2>we are pissed off.</v>

1841
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.231
<v Speaker 2>But to say it,</v>

1842
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1843
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like an Arab spring in the United States.</v>

1844
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating what people are saying.</v>

1845
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1846
00:49:24.521 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like people,</v>

1847
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing of like 1% of the fucking population having all the shit.</v>

1848
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.693
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1849
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it's some point that that can't work anymore.</v>

1850
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're on an a,</v>

1851
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine we're on an island and one,</v>

1852
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:41.440
<v Speaker 2>there's like 10 people on the island and one person on the island has control of</v>

1853
00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 2>all the bananas.</v>

1854
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got to share the bananas,</v>

1855
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:45.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1856
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 2>You gotta pass the bananas around.</v>

1857
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how you got them.</v>

1858
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:49.151
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1859
00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that you look at the end of the day,</v>

1860
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 2>you're using up the earth's resources.</v>

1861
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.011
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

1862
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:57.460
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're talking like some big gigantic corporation,</v>

1863
00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 2>you're using up a gigantic chunk of the earth's resources,</v>

1864
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

1865
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 2>really in all fairness should be distributed equally for all the people on the</v>

1866
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:06.470
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

1867
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 2>We just don't have the technology.</v>

1868
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:08.494
<v Speaker 2>You had to do it.</v>

1869
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And also a lot of the people who have the resources would get distributed to are</v>

1870
00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 2>fucking idiots,</v>

1871
00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:13.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1872
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 2>So that is a real problem because a lot of people are not had because our</v>

1873
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:19.480
<v Speaker 2>education system is crap.</v>

1874
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.560
<v Speaker 2>So people have been being like brought up through a really crappy education</v>

1875
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:23.831
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1876
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Not all schools are terrible,</v>

1877
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:26.134
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them,</v>

1878
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.130
<v Speaker 2>they had these,</v>

1879
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 2>they have way too many kids.</v>

1880
00:50:28.521 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to teach a classroom of 60 fucking kids?</v>

1881
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Many of them in like who are living in poverty and their parents are drug</v>

1882
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 2>addicts.</v>

1883
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to do that?</v>

1884
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to be superman to pull that off.</v>

1885
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the year you're dealing with like,</v>

1886
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1887
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 2>people who haven't been educated and people who are hopeless.</v>

1888
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And so the real question is,</v>

1889
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:51.791
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine that all the 1% that these people are protesting suddenly like</v>

1890
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:52.551
<v Speaker 2>more like,</v>

1891
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:53.061
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1892
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>We're going to distribute our wealth.</v>

1893
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

1894
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Like how would you even do it anyway?</v>

1895
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the,</v>

1896
00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1897
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:59.743
<v Speaker 2>how do you solve?</v>

1898
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1899
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 1>But they're saying we have to do something.</v>

1900
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1901
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:03.320
<v Speaker 1>They're right.</v>

1902
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.711
<v Speaker 1>They're right.</v>

1903
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 1>The system is completely fucked up.</v>

1904
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

1905
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1906
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.810
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense that you,</v>

1907
00:51:07.811 --> 00:51:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1908
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you like the whole idea of the financial system.</v>

1909
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:11.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1910
00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of when you started talking about banks and economics and numbers</v>

1911
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and manipulating things.</v>

1912
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And then things get so weird when you talk about like interest rates and they</v>

1913
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 1>talk about taxes and you talk about the distribution of the money.</v>

1914
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:24.021
<v Speaker 1>Where does the tax,</v>

1915
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:24.551
<v Speaker 1>when they going,</v>

1916
00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:25.040
<v Speaker 1>or is it,</v>

1917
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.110
<v Speaker 1>when you break all these numbers down,</v>

1918
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:31.040
<v Speaker 1>then you realize that these numbers only represent numbers.</v>

1919
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't represent a fucking bag of gold somewhere.</v>

1920
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1921
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 1>They don't represent anything of real value.</v>

1922
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like number.</v>

1923
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:44.201
<v Speaker 1>So then when someone has no fucking $18 billion or something crazy,</v>

1924
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:45.971
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>

1925
00:51:45.971 --> 00:51:46.141
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1926
00:51:46.141 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you examine them and you go,</v>

1927
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

1928
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1929
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I moved numbers,</v>

1930
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I move numbers around and I made billions of dollars moving all these numbers</v>

1931
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and buying and selling numbers and agreeing and,</v>

1932
00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:58.611
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1933
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 1>and Graham Hancock's here.</v>

1934
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1935
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

1936
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.013
<v Speaker 1>All right folks.</v>

1937
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of this one.</v>

1938
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 1>And we'll be right back in about 15 minutes cause he's gonna eat some food,</v>

1939
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.323
<v Speaker 1>but thank you.</v>

1940
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
