WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500
Worst.
You know the Tommy Buns is here.

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:09.480
When you start getting tweets that say my jeans are high and tight and I'm
ready.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.840
If anybody ever started saying calling each other mommies or saying genes are

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.810
high and tight,
we'd have to drive their fucking house and beat their ass.

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.580
Said you mean you want to talk about like a niche that you guys have carved out?

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.530
Yeah.
Jeans high and tight.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.920
I know it feels silly even saying it sometimes.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.950
Like when I say it I'm like,
this sounds so crazy,

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.390
but that's your show though in the show.
It's fucking silly shit man.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.700
Your mom's house,
if you haven't heard it,
it's hilarious.

11
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:43.020
It's an awesome podcast and now you guys have a real studio now.
Yeah,
we finally,

12
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.790
we moved out of our house and got a proper proper studio and a proper office

13
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:51.000
building with real professionals who are like,
who the fuck are you?

14
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.610
It's just like what's happening to podcast meant slowly but surely podcasts are

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.180
being forced to be more and more professional.
It's crazy,
right?
So weird.

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.380
I walk out,
we walk out of our studio door in this really nice building.

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.820
There's an accountant to the right,

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
a lawyer across from me and a shrink to the left and it's like,

19
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:13.320
and they're like,
what are you guys do?
I'm like,
just farts and stuff.

20
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
Do you ever do you guys screen?
Yeah,
but here's the thing.
We go,

21
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.320
they also are like,
when are you,
like,
what kind of front is this?

22
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.170
Because we're there,
you know,
a couple times a week for a couple of hours.

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.390
We're never there.
So when they do see us,
they're like,
oh yeah,
you guys like,

24
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:35.160
you know,
yeah,
we scream sometimes and we don't go check on people.

25
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.650
But we assumed that they're like,
we don't want to know.

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.660
So do you swear like when you screamed you sweat?
Like you fucking bitch must,

27
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.980
right?
Sometimes you get crazy.
It gets crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

28
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.090
Sometimes it gets pretty loud and um,
at certainly offensive to them.

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.590
I mean for like those regular nine to fivers way,
they think that's normal.

30
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.560
A lot of them are listening right now.

31
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.940
People in those kind of offices are listening.
Oh yeah,
that shit is soul sucking.

32
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.400
It is.
I talk about it sometimes that,
do you remember,

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.210
did you ever do a an office office job?
No.
No.

34
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:13.920
I never did an office office job.
I had a job jobs,
but never in an office.

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.230
You know,
I had a lot of,
I just knew,

36
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.110
I just knew from the time was whether whatever it is,

37
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.350
add or whatever the fuck it is.
I knew there was something wrong with my brain.

38
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.300
I was like,
there's no way or something right with it.

39
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.460
I knew there's no way I'm ever going to be able to sit in an office.

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.630
I just can't do it.
Yeah.
I mean,
I think back to when I did it,

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.890
I did it for a while at different places and I realize now looking back on that,

42
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.190
how depressed I was.
It was horrible.
It was really depressing.

43
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.320
And sometimes now when I'm don't feel like doing something like for,

44
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.480
for my career now,
like I'm bummed out to go do something,
you know,
like,
uh,

45
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:53.340
I dunno.
Press or more than radiation.
Yeah.
Morning radio or some morning TV.

46
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.220
Oh,
way worse than morning radio,
way worse,
way worse.

47
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.440
It's the worst.
But when I think of that,
sometimes I'll remind myself like,

48
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.280
oh,
remember that the real job that you had to do,
you know,

49
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.130
and s and sitting in that cubicle and how it really was misery for me.
Yeah.

50
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.790
And I imagine it is for a lot of people still.
I did Labor,

51
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.070
I did a lot of construction gigs.

52
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.580
My Step Dad's an architect and so I got a lot of gigs on construction column

53
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.430
gigs,
jobs on construction sites.

54
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.440
But the worst one I ever got was from my buddy Jimmy.
He got me a job.
Uh,
we were,

55
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.470
uh,
building a knights of Columbus Hall and uh,

56
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.290
we had to build a wheelchair ramp for it.
That's what we're,
we're doing.

57
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.040
And it was just the entire time I was working for them.
I only think I,

58
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:43.360
last two weeks I was carrying cement and pressure treated lumber.

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.990
So I was getting splinters in my fingers from pressure treated lumber and

60
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.330
carrying bags of cement.
And then at the end of the day,

61
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.360
I would try to go work out.
I go to the gym and try to work out collapsed.

62
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.880
I was so tired and Pulitzer wasn't hydrating correctly.
Horse and I,
you know,

63
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.850
I was an idiot back then.

64
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.250
I was eating like fucking Pastrami sandwiches for lunch.

65
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:04.240
Like I wasn't eating healthy all the time.
Well I do too,

66
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.870
but I mean when you're working all day like you know is the eating,

67
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.500
healing yourself throughout the day.
You should,

68
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.480
if you're doing that kind of labor,

69
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.080
the amount of calories that you're burning by carrying lumber and sandbags,

70
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.240
cement bags,
terrible.
It's exhausting.

71
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.590
I remember my first first ever job was construction where it was,

72
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.620
I was a freshman in high school.
It was the summer after freshman year,

73
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.980
so I'm 14 that's how end illegal you not even supposed to be working.

74
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.690
Well here's the job.
My,
my friend's dad,
but really,

75
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.750
really shitty apartment complex and was renovating it to make it like decent.

76
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.020
So he hired us because we were like slave labor,

77
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.880
like free basically giving us,
you know,
whatever the regular rate is.

78
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.380
It's half of that.
But you're the 1415,
so you're like,
yeah,

79
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:48.430
it's a shit load of money.
Right.

80
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.060
And we were in Florida in the summer in apartments with no AC.

81
00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.610
Oh uh,
laying tile.
So you're on your hands and knees,
you know,

82
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.760
putting the grout,
laying the tile and just the heat was cooking it.

83
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:07.210
It was an oven,
you know,
like a hundred percent humidity,

84
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.960
96 degrees outside on your hands and knees sweat,

85
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:15.610
just pools of sweat and then some like actual constructive way stop sweating.

86
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.810
You're like,
I can't,
like I would tell you to stop because you're like,

87
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:20.920
you're cleaning like there you're,
you're getting to sweat in the,

88
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:21.940
in the grout and shit.

89
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.690
So then they'd come by three with towel to clean up your sweat as you're laying

90
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.560
tile on the ground.

91
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.330
I had a summer job where I was putting insulation in walls and attics in the

92
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.440
summer and so you're sweating like ass in Massachusetts.
It's hot and muggy.

93
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.980
You're sweating like a fucking pig and that shit gets in your skin.

94
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.330
It had like literally the fibers from insulation we get in your skin like you

95
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:48.230
just,
you,
it gets in your clothes,
it gets your,

96
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.780
your neck for some reason I can tracks it.

97
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.350
Like it will be always be like in here,

98
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.800
just your breathing it in you where those little stupid masks.

99
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.740
<v 1>But those things don't do Jack Shit.
No,
those little,</v>

100
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.280
I mean they might keep like a large particles from getting sucked right into

101
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:08.600
your trap.
But they come in the sides it,
you're breathing in air.
It's like,

102
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.440
or but if you could look at them unlike some sort of an infrared scan and see

103
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.680
the particles coming in and out,
like you're taking that stuff in your lungs.

104
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.870
Imagine the guy that does that for 40 years.
Oh it does to him.
You know,

105
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:23.750
it's really freaky man.
People that work in coal mines.
Have you ever watched,

106
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.020
they had a reality show for awhile about coal mines,

107
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.480
but I think they probably realized,
hey,

108
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:33.350
we better fucking not have this cause someone's going to die while we're
filming.

109
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.920
Yeah.
And then people are gonna,
you know,
be mad at us for making the show,

110
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.560
but they do live shorter lives.
Right?
They all hundred percent.

111
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.740
They get black lung,
they literally get black lung.
I mean,

112
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.670
you are 100% going to breathe in coal dust all day.

113
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.900
You're in a mine,

114
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.920
you're in a hole in the ground where they're digging and they're pulling out

115
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.220
coal.
I mean,
that's fucking nutty,
man.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's real.

116
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.340
It's really depressing to think about that.
That's that,

117
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.990
that's what you're doing every day.

118
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.480
And he'll like West Virginia and all these like really,

119
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.490
really poor places where they have these minds,

120
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.370
they get pissed when city people want to come in and shut down the mines.
Yeah.

121
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.530
Um,
Sturgill Simpson,
do you know who he is?
Country Music Star.
I know the name,

122
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.210
but brilliant,
brilliant singer,
but awesome.
Awesome.
Due to,
um,
the from there,

123
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.070
he's a,
yeah.
And um,
he has a song about it,
you know,

124
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.420
he has a song about I'm king.
It's all,
I think it's called King Cole.

125
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.260
It's so depressing.

126
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.080
But it's part of it is like that people from the cities come in,

127
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.290
they want to shut the mines down.
Like he,
and he was describing it to me.

128
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.130
He was like,
you,
you never seen poverty like this.
He's like,

129
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.810
it's just like these people don't have nothing.

130
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.500
Like in the song he talks about just welfare and pills,
but that's,

131
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.590
you ever see the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia whole believable.

132
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.410
That's what it's like.
If somebody,
if you've never seen this,

133
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.440
it's so worth theme might be the greatest white people documentary of all

134
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.750
<v 2>it is.
It is.
It's,
it's it,</v>

135
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.100
it goes toe to toe with any and like and Freddy white person that like talks

136
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:06.460
trash about like other races and like,
well you know,

137
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.260
we're just different watch the wonderful whites.

138
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.140
<v 1>West Virginia.
Yeah.</v>

139
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.870
Anybody who thinks that white people are different than anybody else.

140
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:15.240
This is what people are people are,

141
00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:19.860
is extremely malleable thinking organisms that adapt to their environment and

142
00:08:19.861 --> 00:08:24.750
when you're in dire environment is all criminals and pills and welfare and
scams.

143
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.200
You just like,
I think you just grow up in that environment.
That's,

144
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.720
<v 2>that's who you are and it shows that you really are a product of fuck.
Yeah.</v>

145
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.860
That whole family is just,
it's unbelievable how they're all,

146
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.840
they really are the same,
the same organism,
you know,
they're like this,

147
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.050
all these different people,

148
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:46.051
they're from the same family in the same area and there is no like one that's

149
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:50.850
got it together.
It's like,
it's my favorite is a girl.
Hello,

150
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 1>my name is sue sue.

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 3>one.

She in the family,</v>

152
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 2>the,
there was a there.</v>

153
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.950
They're kind of like running through the beats at the beginning.
Yeah.

154
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.970
I love that.
One of them is like talking about,
uh,

155
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.990
pills and she's like,
I think she's got like Xanax and she was like,

156
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.560
pick these up for like two bucks.
And she's like,

157
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.750
I'm run over here and sell for six.
It's a little boot scooting boogie Riley.

158
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.690
I was like,
her profit margin is a four bucks and she's thrilled about it.

159
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.230
<v 3>Yeah.
The one check,
the way she talks,</v>

160
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.960
she knit black gay is like,

161
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:31.170
you can't believe that she's a real person.
That's her right there.

162
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.950
You're doing a toned down version of sexy swine of fam.

163
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.230
See if he can fire her voice.
Jamie.
Because like when you hear a talk you like,

164
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.220
get the fuck Outta here.
That's not a real person.
Yeah,
always been.

165
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.280
It's sexy smile in the family.
Oh,

166
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.860
so,
but you know,
I used to have a buddy that when I lived in,
um,

167
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.330
<v 2>it's going to be her.
Yeah.
Uh,
I got to hear this.</v>

168
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.033
<v 4>She's</v>

169
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.090
her back then when I was saved at 18,

170
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.500
19 years old and he's somebody,

171
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.420
I'd probably say 10 to $2,000 a night.

172
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.240
And uh,
I'm always been a sexist one.
They look tired,
man.
I ones that time,

173
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.830
thousands of paper,

174
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.770
<v 3>good documentary.
It's really great.
I had his buddy who was a,</v>

175
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.890
when I lived in New York who's racist and a,
he's a good dude,

176
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:32.280
but he would say shit about black people.
I always get really mad at him.

177
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.390
We always had disagreements about race and he would go,
look,
he goes,

178
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.010
it's not racist if,
if it's everywhere you look,
he goes,
if it,
you see,

179
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.970
he goes,
it's just being honest about what you're saying.
I said,
no,

180
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:47.100
because if you grew up in that environment,
you would be them.

181
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:50.280
You dumb mother fucker.
Like you think you're something special just because you,

182
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:53.950
you grew up in Westchester County.
Yeah.

183
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.200
In some nice white neighborhood.
You know,
like all your problems.

184
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:00.210
You attribute all your problems because he had problems,

185
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.910
but he would attribute all his problems to his family and his fucked up

186
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.000
upbringing.
I'm like,
well,
think about your problems and your,

187
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.700
how mild you're fucked up.

188
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.920
Sadness was compared to these people that live in Harlem.
Yeah.

189
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.230
Are these people that live in the boogie down in the South Bronx that you're oh

190
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.820
shit.
Not like,
yeah,
dude,
if you grew up in that environment,

191
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:18.840
you wouldn't be special.

192
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.870
You wouldn't stand out as being this guy who gets it together and it's showing

193
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:25.210
up for work every day and he'd be smoking crack just like them.
Yeah.

194
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.410
You'd be doing things.
But we are a product of our environment.

195
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.990
<v 2>Well it's like people,
they don't think that,
uh,</v>

196
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.940
how they don't think about how lucky they are just to be born somewhere in a

197
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:39.830
certain circumstance.
Yeah.
I mean like I was shooting this,
uh,
uh,

198
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.030
shooting the intro to my new special we're shooting log,

199
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:47.650
we shouldn't like a one minute like short that that plays right before the

200
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:50.580
special,
you know,
like a little sketch basically.

201
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.250
And we were shooting it all over la and we ended up in

202
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v 0>uh,</v>

203
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.650
east La and Ramona gardens and the hazard projects.

204
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.140
This shit is no joke.
Right.
And as were there,
I was like,

205
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.570
just thinking about like,
man,

206
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.150
like cause all these kids came up to us because they saw the,
you know,

207
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:14.260
the cameras and the equipment,
you know,
the boom and all that.
And they were like,

208
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.000
they were just interested in what we were doing when they were young kid.

209
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.300
I mean they're teenage kids.
I just couldn't help but think about like,
man,

210
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:26.410
like this,
this funny thing that I,
cause it's still considered Los Angeles.

211
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:30.370
I was like,
when you say la to these kids,
this is what they think it is.

212
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.460
This is la to them.
Like the projects here,

213
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.050
they don't think of La as Bell Hollywood or Bel Air or,
or you know,

214
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.410
Malibu.
Like everyone's perspective on what that is,

215
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.350
is dependent on where you're from and you brought up like,

216
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:47.560
they have a really rough neighborhood man.

217
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.330
Really rough.
Like that's Mexican mafia,
you know,

218
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.310
cartel kind of shit.
Like,
you know,
it's face tattoos.
Oh fuck yeah.

219
00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:01.510
A lot men a lot.
It's scary shit.
And,
and,
and,
and those kids were just born there.

220
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.260
You know,
you just get a shit,
roll the dice.
Yeah.

221
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.900
You go to school with all those crazy kids that are dealing with whatever they

222
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:12.610
had to deal with when they're growing up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Man,
there's,

223
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
there's a real problem in our culture where,
uh,
that doesn't get addressed.

224
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.060
Like when you hear Donald Trump on TV talking about Mexicans coming over here,

225
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:23.530
they're all rapists and murderers.
Hey Dude,

226
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:27.940
we got plenty of rapists and murderers right here.
Yeah.
And then some of them,

227
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.270
I assume are good people.
Yeah.
This is,

228
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.440
I assume some of them,
some of them,

229
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.540
but the idea that nobody ever talks about like what a real issue that it was

230
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:44.470
like nobody or people will lay out like problems,
tax problems.

231
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.550
Like they'll lay out like,

232
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:48.430
here's the problem with taxes in this country and this is my plan and I want to

233
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:50.590
institute a flat tax.
I don't want to do this and don't do that.

234
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.270
But nobody ever goes like,

235
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.470
these are kids that are growing up in these environments that are fucked and

236
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:56.830
they're there.

237
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.640
The burden that they have is so much more than the burden that someone has if

238
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:05.370
they're growing up in Pasadena.
Oh yeah.
You know,
extreme poverty's,
that's a real,

239
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.551
it's a real,

240
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:10.510
real issue that affects a lot more people and we have it in this country.

241
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.500
Oh yeah.
People always think of it as,
you know,
cause it is,
you know,
more extreme,

242
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:16.870
let's say in other places.
But there's a lot,

243
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:20.290
there's millions of people as countries that live in extreme below the poverty

244
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:24.940
line.
Yeah.
And yearly income.
The cost of living is higher here.

245
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.050
So like if you compare the extreme poverty here compared to the extreme poverty

246
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:30.330
in Bangladesh.
Yeah,
yeah.

247
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.690
I'm sure Bangladesh has more extreme poverty and it's probably more extreme even

248
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.730
in the context of like even if you look at the cost of living.
Yeah.

249
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.610
But it's,
it's still no excuse.
It's like there's,

250
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.740
there's no thought at all about trying to fix those issues.
Right?
Yeah.

251
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.800
People yet they're not,
it's not on their mind.
It's fucked man.

252
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:53.780
Cause think about it like how much time do you,

253
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:57.110
have you ever met someone who had a fucked up childhood and you go,
man,

254
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:59.900
if you could just get out of your own way and you can just figure out how to get

255
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.010
out of your own way and deal with all the shit that has messed you up up until

256
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:07.940
this point you'd,
you'd have so much more opportunity.

257
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.910
You'd have so much more.
You would get things done more.

258
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.010
Sometimes they didn't even have a fucked up childhood.

259
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.080
You just meet them and you're like,
get out of your own way.
Like it's all your,

260
00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:20.790
your putting the obstacles in front of yourself.
Right.

261
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.950
I think a big problem with a lot of people have it in different facets of life.

262
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.530
It's just denial,
you know?
Yes.
And I was a big thing.

263
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:32.510
People live in denial about any number of things I can live with about,
about,

264
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.130
you know,
jobs,
about money,
about looks,
about weight,
about sex,

265
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:40.190
about everything.
But like that did not,
you can really,

266
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.650
you can sink into it and live in it for decades.

267
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.980
You'll live your whole life in denial.
Some people like that a lot.
Yeah,

268
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:49.190
you don't,
if you don't want to look at what you're doing wrong,

269
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.550
you don't want to look at what you need to clean up and it's really,

270
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:56.150
it's really that they're scared of the feelings.
Sure.
It's just a fear of like,

271
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.340
if I face that,
what will that be like?

272
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:00.590
And I think the reality is most of the time when you do,

273
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.270
it's not as bad as you thought.

274
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:05.780
It's the fear of that feeling is worse than the feeling itself.
Well,
the feeling,

275
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:07.490
even if it does suck,
once you get over it,

276
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:10.280
the feeling of overcoming that is so much better than the feeling of just

277
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:14.060
dealing with it and putting it in the box.
Yeah,
true.
You know the people that,

278
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.390
people that are ignore reality or hide from reality that you,

279
00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:21.970
you were only going to get so far with that you're only going to,

280
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.330
you're always going to have those boundaries up that you can't overcome because

281
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.420
you've put them up to protect yourself from the truth.

282
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.480
And part of what it is about being a person when you're trying to get better at

283
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:36.170
something,
you gotta be able to look at the truth and you have to be.
Yeah.

284
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.050
And if you,
if you don't look at the truth in certain aspects of your life,

285
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.450
that's going to creep into the other aspects of your life too.
Yeah.
It's,

286
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.500
it's like the whole thing of,
you know,

287
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:50.030
being organized at your desk is going to spill out to your yeah.

288
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.450
To your house and your car.
And you know what I mean?
Like you do one thing right.

289
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.240
It will,
it will spill out to the rest.
And if you do things wrong,

290
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.220
it'll spill out to yeah,
there was a,

291
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:03.170
the old saying the gym like live every minute like a champion.
Do,

292
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:06.310
do your homework like a champion.
Do you know what,

293
00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:07.460
whatever chores you have to do,

294
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:10.490
do that like a champion and you will be a champion in everything you do.

295
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:14.660
Be a champion in everything you do in life.
But I'm not,

296
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.790
I'm not doing that.
My office is a mess.
Well it's hard.

297
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:22.400
It's hard to do that.
Everything fucking problem right now.

298
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.570
I should make a video just to shame myself of my office because I get these

299
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:30.800
packages is boxes of shit that people send me in that company send me and they

300
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.560
fucking stack up to my office.

301
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.950
I sure my house looks clean cause you know I have a wife.
Yeah,

302
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.340
she's organized and stuff,
but my office looks like I'm a fucking hoarder.

303
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.120
My office was my whole house.
He'd be like cheese.
Yeah.

304
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.260
This weekend though.
All right.
I've got home.
I put,
uh,

305
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.650
I put a dent in it Thursday and another Denton and on Sunday I got rid of a lot

306
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:56.100
of shit.
It's crazy.
I feel like someone sneaks into my place and puts it there.

307
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.660
Cause I gave,
I did like a filled up eight trash bags,

308
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.680
like big ones of just clothes and shit and cords,

309
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.400
papers and then like it was like a week or two later I'm like where'd all this

310
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:11.610
shit comes?
Like there's new shit.
I feel like I haven't bought it or anything.

311
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:12.990
It's just spilling out of places.

312
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.180
I have cables that go to things that I don't even own it don't you hold onto

313
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.340
them.
What if I do get another Garmin navigation system?

314
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.480
I wouldn't put it in the of rental car.

315
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:28.140
I each time I had like three or four of these fucking stupid Garmin's all the

316
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:29.790
new ones different.
Let me get the new one.

317
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.440
This one you download the updates from the internet and you plug it in with the

318
00:18:33.441 --> 00:18:37.800
USB for sure.
Ooh,
it's exciting.
I threw away cables.
I'm like,

319
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:42.120
what is it male to male USB cable?
Do I need to do it?
No,
you don't need it.

320
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.330
If you need it,
you go to Fry's and you get a new one.
Yeah,

321
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:49.140
but I had to talk it out like,
like I was on hoarders.
My wife was like,

322
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.250
are we cool to get rid of this?
And I was like,
wait,
let me think about it.

323
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:56.700
It means something to me that in boxes the box at the shit came in.
I'm like,

324
00:18:56.701 --> 00:19:00.420
just keep those boxes.
It's like for what?
I don't know is the box.

325
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.640
It came in that box.
We should keep that box.
It's part of that from,
you know,

326
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:09.600
we were all poor.
Like we were all at one point in our life.
We were all poor.

327
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.740
And when you're poor,
you know you,
you,
you like everything is like precious.

328
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.820
You've got to keep the shit.
Is that what it is?
I think it almost goes back to,

329
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.700
I think it goes back to like Christmas,
childhood,

330
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.030
Christmas where it's like the box that the thing came in.

331
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.550
It's like it's as exciting as what's in it.

332
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.710
And it was also super important to returning things.
Like in my house,

333
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.190
my mom returned fucking everything that she bought and they got a new thing.

334
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.730
Like she was always exchanging.
So I feel like I'm almost attached to like,

335
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.740
I might have to,
I might need this for the product later,
even though I never do,

336
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.460
you know,
I've never returned.
Do you ever return things that you buy online?

337
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.600
I've only done it like once or twice out of hundred purchases.

338
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:57.510
You know,
like,
I don't,
I don't do it a lot.
My wife does it every month.
No,

339
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:01.620
I could not do that.
Every month she sends something back
again.

340
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.200
I'd be overwhelmed at the idea.
I've watched shit.
I bought shit that's like,

341
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.230
been pretty expensive.
I'm like,
I don't really like this.
And then I just keep it

342
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.910
like an asshole.
Like it just sits there and I'm like,
Eh,
you know,

343
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.030
online shopping is a real fucking problem for some people.

344
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.400
It's become more of a problem that any other kind of shopping,

345
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.660
you realize where it's going to go to.

346
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.100
Like there's going to be that there's no stores at some point.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

347
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.840
Well the stores that exist,
uh,

348
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:32.670
probably like either stores for like large appliances so that you have to

349
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:37.320
actually go and check out or maybe like,
well,

350
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.490
like small stores that are like owned by people like small.

351
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.301
Have you noticed that?

352
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:46.680
Like there's these fake like craft restaurants.

353
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.050
They're like fake meaning that like they use like,

354
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.940
like raw metal and like weathered looking wood.

355
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:58.930
It's not really weathered.
It's not really old.
Whoa.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

356
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:02.710
Like does this like trend,
it's a whole look.
Yeah.
This is like,

357
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.710
what is it called craftsman,
this trend to make everything look like,
yeah.

358
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040
Isn't it that that was the thing with closed for a long,

359
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.110
I mean it's probably still is right?

360
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:14.460
Where it's like the jeans that you buy that look like you've had them for years

361
00:21:14.461 --> 00:21:15.294
and um,
yeah.

362
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.540
And then all faded or looks like it's a natural faded look.

363
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:23.650
But actually they did it in a factory.
Like they made it look faded.
Well,

364
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:27.890
they beat him up too.
They wreck them and rub them with wire crusher.

365
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.840
We are shipping.
Yeah.
It's very weird.
It's weird that girls can still wear them.

366
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.020
Girls can still wear jeans with like all these fake holes in them.

367
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.730
Dudes can't wear that anymore.
No,
no.
There's the genes for a guy.

368
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.170
There's pretty much what?
There's pretty much three things that are acceptable.

369
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.250
You're either like a skinny Jean Dude Guy,
right?
Like that's just your look.

370
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.320
Or you can be wearing like skin tight baggy jeans or fuck it.

371
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.960
I'm like,
I'm giving up on things.
Sweatpants.

372
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.980
It's like sweat pants or it's like that dad gene,

373
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.030
like where they're kind of like,

374
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:04.150
like whitewashed almost like they're like light light,
light,

375
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:07.870
light blue where you're like,
it doesn't look that like good really on anyone.

376
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.600
They kind of where I'm a little too high.
Like the high and tight.
Tight,

377
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.130
tight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's,

378
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.520
there's certain looks that are still acceptable for women though.

379
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.540
Like women can go way further with the looks.
You,

380
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.160
they can have holes all over their genes from their pockets all the way down to

381
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.470
like their knees.
How about this?
Speaking of high and tight,

382
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:30.370
the super high waisted over the naval look where it still looks good.

383
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.670
That's a new thing,
right?
It's like it was old and it came back.
Yeah.

384
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.120
And then over the navel.
Yeah,
over the naval I've seen it.
Yeah,

385
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.170
that's unnecessary.
And you only see it on like really fit women.

386
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:44.980
Like it's not like,
you know,
like that's like a sexy look.
It's like,
you know,

387
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.930
they do that they can wear,

388
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.420
they can wear a low cut one where it sits below the waist or you can see it like

389
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.830
super low.
That's good.
That's good.
Yeah.

390
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.570
Well we like it like the smallest amount of cloth between your vagina and an
air.

391
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.430
Yeah,
that's true.
That's what we like.

392
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.950
If you're wearing like some sort of a fucking jumper suit,

393
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.150
it goes all the way up to your neck.
I mean,
I had a quarter,
Roy.
Yeah,
no I don't.

394
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:09.220
It's too much work.
And then there's like,

395
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:12.280
it's almost amazing sometimes where like you see,

396
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.050
I'm not even saying it at the beach,

397
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:19.051
like I'm in a restaurant and hotel ass cheek hanging out of those genes where

398
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:21.960
you're like,
it kind of stops you in your tracks or something,
right.

399
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.430
Where you're like,
wow,
that's a real ass cheek,

400
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.460
almost naked in this hotel lobby right now.

401
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.880
And then she's just like getting another key for the room.
Thanks a lot.

402
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:33.220
And you're like,
do you know how you're walking around right now?

403
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.440
You're talking about pants or shorts?
Shorts,
yeah.
Yeah.
You're like,
Jesus Christ,

404
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.710
half of your vagina is hanging out,
hanging out.
And then she was like,

405
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.470
could you not look at me please?
Thanks.
Yeah.
If she's climbing,

406
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:45.890
if she's stepping a stair

407
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.640
<v 3>climbing stair and then drops her keys and bends over to pick it up with one leg</v>

408
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:52.720
up,
you'll see your posting little little lips gonna fall out.
Yeah.
Yep.

409
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.080
Especially if she's got those
horse lips.

410
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.060
My can only hope.
Yeah.
And the frayed them down,

411
00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:05.630
like to get to the crunch is like so small.

412
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:10.100
It's like barely holds it all together.
We can barely,

413
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.970
yeah.
I mean,
I look,
I'm celebrating that.
Look,
I'm not critical of it,

414
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.160
but it's still is.
It's amazing that that's a choice in society,

415
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.510
right?
Like the barely clothing.
They're working hard and it's,

416
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.410
it's a girl choice.
It's like dudes can't wear daisy dukes.

417
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.740
Yes.
Unless you're trying to get some deck.
Yeah.

418
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:33.890
I mean you can get that Dick with that for sure.
You can get that deck.
Yeah guys,

419
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.580
you would wear a daisy dukes and like timberlands with like scrunchy socks.

420
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.890
That's a hell of a look.
A certain look where like,

421
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.640
unquestionably,
that dude's want to suck your deck.

422
00:24:45.641 --> 00:24:49.280
Can I got a guy with a construction hat on where a daisy dukes,

423
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:53.660
no shirt and scrunchy socks with timberlands on that dude's just sucking tech.

424
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:54.710
That's what he's here for.

425
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.640
And if you see that dude and you make eye contact and you just grabbed your
Dick,

426
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.040
he's going to come over at attack you.
Would that be all?
Yeah.

427
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.490
Fucking manly pasture here man.

428
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.600
Some dude's not into that.
They're into the 20th yeah.

429
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.780
Twinks but you can get in trouble from saint twink.
Did you know that?

430
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.520
Twinks now is that off the table?

431
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.500
The Guy who owns Bravo got in trouble for saying twink he called somebody a

432
00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:26.450
twink the Gig Andy Guy.
Andy Cohen who's out as gay as a guy can be.
Yeah,

433
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.430
he's bought with case a guy,
he's,
he's like,
I would say like perfect gay too.

434
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.650
Like he's got it all going.
Handsome,
handsome,
wealthy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He'd probably,

435
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.540
great suits.
Just gets Dick and tossed at his phone.

436
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.560
Probably runs out of batteries every five minutes because it's just vibrating.

437
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:46.790
He gets picks hired at.
Sure.
And how long can a battery,

438
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.110
how many Dick Pics can a battery get before it just dies?

439
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.060
I bet that's kind of pyramid.
Yeah.

440
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.130
Andy knows the answer and that's the name of that segment.
It's called asking.

441
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.430
She just get,
he should be the guy that they test all their iPhone batteries on

442
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.080
or like,
you know,

443
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.790
he's just so successful and he's handsome and go salt and pepper hair.
He's not,

444
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:14.930
some people don't know this.
He's not just like higher town.
He's the executive.

445
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:20.000
He makes the programming choices.
Yeah.
It's pretty remarkable.

446
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.250
Hilarious that he has all these housewives like bitching at each other.
Yeah.

447
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.450
Those fucking shows have gotten so brutal.

448
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.610
I watched the real housewives.
My wife watches the Beverly Hills one,
so it was a,

449
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:34.850
we had it on the Dvr and in the gym in the house.
So I said,

450
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:38.560
let me watch this fucking shit.
It's like,
it ain't watch the lift house wise.

451
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.260
It doesn't make you angry enough to lift.
It makes you confused me.
You,
you,

452
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.760
you feel so bad for those women.

453
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:48.090
You want to take them and like take them on a psychedelic retreat or something.

454
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.540
Like what are you doing?
I understand that this is a job and that you're,

455
00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:55.890
you're kind of getting paid to,
to be this person and this,

456
00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.030
it becomes intoxicating because you get all this intention and then you got to

457
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.690
kind of get caught up in the momentum of being on the cover of these magazines.

458
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:06.570
And this girl's got a feud with that girl and I won't work with her and Blah,

459
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:10.890
blah blah.
But when you watch them scream and yell at each other and Oh my God,

460
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:14.310
I can't watch that after awhile.
I can't watch the um,
like when they,

461
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.740
cause those shows,
they,
they ride on that.
Like the,

462
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.120
the fuel of that show is confrontations and after you watch,
you know,

463
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.540
so many people argue and insult and get like just meet and shitty.

464
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.120
Like after one commercial break,
after the other,

465
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.670
there's a certain point where I tap out,
I can't do it.

466
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.040
You know what's also for nothing,
right.
You always vote,

467
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.980
but nothing of substance is argument.
Yeah.

468
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.980
It's not like somebody robbed someone in some sort of a business deal.

469
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.570
Tell Cathy that my party was Friday and she said she was bringing them out and I

470
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:49.080
was like,
you can't fucking bring them out.
It's not your party bitch.

471
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.640
I can't believe it.
Then that's,

472
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:55.910
that is the episode is that Cathy is bringing Ramon to the fucking party without

473
00:27:56.401 --> 00:28:00.690
asking you just get off those fucking pills.
You had no bad bitch.

474
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.280
These girls were,
one of them was going on.
She said something about,
uh,
you know,

475
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.320
everybody knows about your husband.

476
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:09.750
You bring my fucking husband up you fucking bed.

477
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.900
She throws a drink at her and throws a glass at her and like,

478
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.530
we don't even know what they know and might not even be real.

479
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.240
I mean they might orchestrate it.
Sure.

480
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.090
I mean they might've said she's going to bring up your husband and you're going

481
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:24.120
to freak out.
So when she brings up your husband,
there's the fuck out.

482
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.240
Just freak the fuck out.
Throw glass.
And she threw a glass,

483
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.140
but she threw it kind of inner direction like at the ground,

484
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.670
like if you're throwing a glass at somebody,
it's already assault.
Okay.
If you,

485
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:37.470
if you hit someone in the glass,
the glass breaks.

486
00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:41.820
I think that's assault with a dangerous weapon because it's just,
it means glass.

487
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.440
Are you going fuck someone's face up?

488
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.840
If someone's really trying to hurt you with the glass,

489
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:48.330
they throw it at you but they're not throwing it at you.

490
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:50.520
She's like throwing it like sort of at the ground,

491
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:54.270
like in front of you to make a point.
It's a dramatic and fake.

492
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.010
Took all those bitches and bring them to that projects that you went to.
Oh,

493
00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.470
bringing in West Virginia.
Make them hang out with a real housewives,

494
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.330
real housewives.
How it's been.
It's actually mine and mine.
Oh,

495
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:09.560
you fucking,
what are you talking about?
Hashtags sexy.
Look at how that

496
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.960
one was an ex four books and just opening up her lips and stuff and trouts in
it.

497
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.070
Cal Fish plumping her lips up with just fish guts,

498
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.930
zip beaking a Dick's.

499
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.190
Did you already talk about that guy with the button now?

500
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:28.300
The biggest dick in the world.
We haven't talked about it.

501
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.490
The Mexican gentleman that has an 18 inch 20 pound dick.
Yeah,
we're,

502
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:34.200
the circumference of the head is 10 inches.

503
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.440
That Dick Pic,
that would get Andy moist.
It makes not really,

504
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:44.420
I think nobody wants an ass that's trashed out.
Plus.
That's like a Horse Dick.

505
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.870
That's like the guy who fucking death by the horse.
It's a horse.

506
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.170
It's way bigger than all wars.
Tick.
No,
no,
it's not.
We get on,
well,

507
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.680
the Horse Dick was like literally like an arm.
This is pretty close.

508
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.530
He said it's ruined his life.
He said,
he's like,

509
00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.100
I don't know why it affected work,
but he,
you know,
effective jobs.

510
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:03.490
He said no woman's wants to be with them.
Yeah,
but he's probably,

511
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:06.990
you're a fucking loser anyway.
Yeah.
Okay.

512
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.680
What do you think he's having fun listening to this episode.

513
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:15.490
He's like this Mexican.
Yeah.
He can't speak English.
We don't could,

514
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:18.220
we're not going to stop Mexicans from download your podcast.
They're rapists.

515
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:21.880
But why don't I say that?
That's bullshit.
Every time I go it was the San Diego.

516
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:24.500
I'm surprised at how many people come to my show that are from Tijuana.

517
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.440
I really to come up.
Yeah,
you can come up like this is like illusion.
You know,

518
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:30.700
like people have this idea that you,

519
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.910
it's impossible to like visit the United States from Mexico.

520
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:37.330
You could totally visit.
Yeah,
sure do.
You can come up all the time.

521
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:39.280
Like people come up from t one all the time.

522
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.510
Like whenever I do shows down in San Diego,
I do either.

523
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:46.390
I do the part.
What does that fucking place?
Not the parlor.

524
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.040
What does that shit hole?
Uh,
I dunno.
I only do,

525
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.220
I'm doing the Balboa theatre next time I'm there,
but every time I go,

526
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:57.880
I always meet people from Tijuana about both.
How big is Baba?
It's pretty big.

527
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.610
2000.
So it's pretty big.
It's a good spot to do the clubs ever gives them to,

528
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.690
sometimes I do American comedy club.
I did that before that small.
I do.

529
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.340
I used to do,
um,
La Jolla Camidge store.
Oh right.
That's really nice.
Right.

530
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.830
It's fucking great.
I used to do that spot,

531
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.870
but then I didn't do the store for like seven years.

532
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:16.390
But now that I do the store again,
I'm like do that.
I would be into doing it.

533
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.450
I love that place.
You're going to get a call that day about that shit too.

534
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:20.320
Fond spot,
man.

535
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:24.480
It's one of the Nick Depalo a recorded one of his cds there and the lawyers.

536
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.850
Yeah,
I think it's first CD recorded down there.
It's a great spot.

537
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.600
It's like the comment you see,
oh,
are in the comedy store,
but it's in La Jolla,

538
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.780
which is a fucking great neighborhood by the way.
It's a nice neighborhood.

539
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.060
That's not the hazard projects.
No.

540
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.360
The lawyer though is tricky if you're raising kids.

541
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:45.100
Cause I have a friend who grew up in La Jolla and she's like,
it's all just,

542
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:49.600
everyone's fucked up on drugs.
Like those kids are on Ahcccs in high school.

543
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.200
There's Norton math and they're doing all kinds of crazy shit.

544
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.630
It's like everybody's ignored by their parents.

545
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.560
There's like no real sense of community is rampant materialism.

546
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:04.510
There's like these,
these a re Oh,
poor baby.
Well,

547
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:06.790
you grill when up to rich.
I'm not saying that,

548
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.070
but what I am saying is everybody's got their problems.

549
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.410
There's a comfortable medium somewhere,

550
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.400
but the rich people that ignore their kids and they're just constantly focused

551
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:20.350
on just making money.
That's,
that develop some fucked up kids.
Man.
It reminds me,

552
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:23.560
everything you're describing reminds me of like the rich kids of Miami.
Oh yeah.

553
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.700
It's like something about the beach,
you know,

554
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.030
sat like the Southern Beach Culture,
uh,

555
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:34.480
of with lots of money where it was like,
just so like,

556
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.200
kids grew up way too fast.
I think in Miami you can grow up way too fast.
Yeah.

557
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.250
With sex stuff.

558
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.690
<v 0>With drugs,
it's like,
dude,
what you're having sex,
you're fucking 12 like,</v>

559
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:48.110
this is so crazy.
Well,
I had to get into concept,
so I had to suck some Dick.

560
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.390
Okay,
okay.
Okay.
Yes sir.
Yeah,
it is dangerous man.

561
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.550
The but those cultures like where you have the rampant materialism in Miami is

562
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:01.710
one of the biggest show east culture.
So we have and shine.

563
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.500
When you drive down the street,

564
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.940
you're going to see people that have these crazy cars and they have like neon

565
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:10.190
under the car.
It's like having a Ferrari is not good enough.

566
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:14.120
You have to have Ferrari with neon underneath it and you have to have big giant

567
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:18.110
wheels.
There was a fucking,
this guy had a BMW.

568
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:22.850
I was in Miami recently flew from Costa Rica to Miami and I put a picture of the

569
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:25.280
car on my Instagram page cause it was so ridiculous.

570
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.370
He had a BMW with like 35 inch wheels,
like wagon wheels on it.

571
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.230
It was so stupid.
It didn't even seem real.

572
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:36.710
Like I couldn't believe that those were the real wheels he had on his car.

573
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.990
That was in Miami.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The Guy,

574
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.960
the guy who was a driver told us what it was that,
what they call it.

575
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:43.190
They have like a name for it.

576
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.420
They call it like when you put giant wheels on your car down there.
Super Black,

577
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.000
Puerto Rican.
I Dunno if it's super,

578
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.370
is that super black?
Is that a black move?
I mean I think it's always,

579
00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.290
I've always associated it with black stuff.
Sure.
Yeah.
That culture down there,

580
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.260
there's something about that Miami Swag.
Yeah.

581
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.310
There's something about our culture that is also not quite there it is.

582
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.050
Look at the wheels on that.
Come on.
Yeah.

583
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.520
Well get the fuck wheels on that thing.
So stupid.
That's just stupid.

584
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.980
Well this is the size of those things.
I mean that is a four wheel drive.

585
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.960
Like looking we'll let should be on sweet ride.
Man.
That's a nice car.

586
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.240
It's a nice BMW.
Fucked it all up with that.
Yeah.

587
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.700
It looks like they're probably three or four sizes too big.

588
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.960
At least
fucking stupid.

589
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:39.320
And it's got the like the deep dish that like that doesn't go with that car at

590
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:40.220
all.
Yeah.

591
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:44.240
What is it about like having bigger wheels that anybody would ever think would

592
00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:47.900
be good that took off?
I want to say that took off in the,

593
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.650
I feel like in the 90s is everybody,

594
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:55.400
the whole thing was to get twenties and then I remember the first time I heard

595
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.670
some,
like somebody in a rap song was like,
I'm sitting on 22 cause I was like,

596
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.170
oh shit.
He went up to inches like this dude.
That was a thing.

597
00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:05.180
And then it just must have just taken out where it was.

598
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.250
It's always about trumping that,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.
What do you got and know?

599
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.930
I'm sitting on 30 fives man.
That's so crazy.

600
00:35:11.931 --> 00:35:16.010
Do you remember when they used to have the dub thing by the front front fender

601
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.040
that would show like it would have like the number 26 oh right.

602
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:24.350
I'm going to show you that.
Show you what I'm riding on the dog.

603
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.180
You know like a boss for 27 those old mustangs,
right.

604
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.430
Would have it on the fender to let you know what was under the hood.
Right,
right.

605
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:35.300
It would put that next to the front fender wheel,
the wheel size leg.

606
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:38.460
You know why non Zam dubs

607
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.130
<v 3>and dubs means twenties right?
Yeah.
That's 20s.
Yeah.</v>

608
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.100
So the magazine Dub is all about twenties,
twenties,

609
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:48.480
man dubs sac.
It's 20 sack.
Yeah.

610
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.860
That's all about the
coffee culture.
Yeah.

611
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.220
But then Miami culture on top of that has the echoes of the cocaine import

612
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.700
business because when,
when I was in Miami,

613
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.120
I had my buddy Steve Graham did his residency.
Um,

614
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.680
he went to a Ma,
I think it went either went to medical school down there,

615
00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:13.310
but he did his residency down there and,
uh,
he's,

616
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.250
he's an ophthalmologist and he worked in the emergency room and he would show me

617
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:22.050
these crazy fucking pictures of dudes with like light bulbs stuffed up the Ras.

618
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:25.590
There's like so many people that come through the emergency room with things and

619
00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:30.060
they're stuck in their ass.
The guy had a gun stuck in his ass.

620
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.540
He had a gun,
a gun stock loaded his ass.

621
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.770
Fuck man,
it's so crazy.

622
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.120
Like a 22 stuffed in his ass hole.

623
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.970
Do you think that that's,
that's uh,
about like showing up someone who's like,

624
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:50.840
hey man,
you know,
I had a fucking light bulb in my ass.
He's like,

625
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.770
you think you're,
you think you're fucking tough shit.

626
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.720
And then he just grabs a gun and shoved it in his ass.
Bitch,
I'll show you.

627
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.500
I'll show you where I keep my gun pitch,

628
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.810
but you see how raw and you want to know how real I am.
Like Ah,

629
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.040
it spits on his gun.
Just shoves it right down there.
Roland dog edge,
all the,

630
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:11.860
like the hard edges of them metal,
you know,
it's not a smooth,
like,

631
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.080
like oval shape,
some damage.
God,

632
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.340
I'd be scared of fingernails.
I forgot about it.
Fucking gone.

633
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.250
Remember the guy you saw the,
you saw the one guy,

634
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.630
one cup one John saw Jesus Christ.
That's terrifying.

635
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:28.620
And it breaks and he's like,

636
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:33.480
he's dance breaks and cuts him open and then just start shitting out these

637
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:37.830
chunks of glass.
Like could clink,
clink,
clink.
You don't hear him whimper at all?

638
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.700
No,
he didn't even,
he probably wanted to be hurt.
Yeah.

639
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.960
There's certain people that they believe have a different sensors.

640
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.500
Like they have a different sensitivity to pain.
Like literally they're,

641
00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:53.200
they don't feel pain the way other people feel pain.
And,
uh,

642
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.910
they think that that's like a lot of folks that are extremely into piercing.

643
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.740
They get real nutty with tattoos and piercings and lips.

644
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:06.060
Eyes.
Yeah.
And then self mutilation,

645
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.370
you know,
like they say that some,

646
00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.820
some of those folks like they can't feel they don't like,

647
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.120
and then also it has something to do with some of them.

648
00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:15.960
Obviously not all of them,

649
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:19.680
but some of them it has something to do with emotional pain.
Yeah,

650
00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:22.730
that makes sense to me.
I didn't have,
I also have heard about like the uh,

651
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.780
that sensory receptors in our brains and some people can get overlapped where

652
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.080
things that are supposed to be like a pleasure receptor goes to pain and pain

653
00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:36.010
goes to pleasure,
you know,
so it's something that that's

654
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.810
<v 0>supposed to hurt you,
ends up feeling good.
I want the fuck.
Yeah.</v>

655
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.230
Something that's supposed to be like,
uh,

656
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.840
you know that your brain supposed to tell you don't do that.

657
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:49.210
And something like this is good.
Put a gun in your house,

658
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.130
put a gun and you're all the way in your ass.
It's such a crazy thing to do.

659
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:59.600
Number that bitten on?
Um,
uh,
it's a jackass when he has the,
the car in his ass,

660
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.490
the little toilet guy.
That's one of my favorites.

661
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:06.580
And what was that one or two?
I think that's in one.
That's,
no,

662
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.590
I've never watched all,
don't put it up.
I've never watched all of jackass.

663
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.270
Really?
No.
I only watched like a couple stents from like one of them.
I can't,

664
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.450
there's something about those guys doing that shit even though I know they're

665
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:21.200
alive because they already did it.
Yeah.

666
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.510
There's something about that that I don't like and one of the things that I

667
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:27.910
don't like is because I've been around dudes like that,

668
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.080
not to the extreme that those guys take it,
cause those guys go too far,

669
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.250
but I'm always like,

670
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.090
you guys are going to get fucked up and then it's not going to be funny anymore.

671
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.250
Right.
Like what you're doing now is adorable.

672
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:44.020
If you don't get killed or maimed or paralyzed route,
the thing every time,

673
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.850
basically every segment,
someone should be hurt.
Main paralyzed or killed.

674
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.150
Yeah.
Every time.
Yeah,
without question.
Yeah.
It's so crazy what they do.

675
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:57.160
And the idea that you're getting attention for this is crazy because now other

676
00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.690
kids are going to get attention for the same fucking thing and they're going to

677
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.930
try to up you.

678
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.540
Everyone tries to up everybody and he gets to this point where it's,

679
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.220
it's,
you know you're going to hit a wall and you're gonna fucking die.
Yeah.
No,

680
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.940
it's crazy.
I mean,
well the one guy did I not doing it with,

681
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.770
he was drunk driving and driving.
Yeah,

682
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.100
but I think that had to have something to do with the way they were living.

683
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:21.460
They live crazy.
Dude's push each other.
Right.

684
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.240
And if in you're in that environment where Mikey's,
he's so sick,

685
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.840
he's the sickest.
You think your Schick,
what do you mean Mikey and then Mike,

686
00:40:29.841 --> 00:40:33.550
he's like,
I'm going to do a flip off this building.
Don't like Mikey.
Mikey.

687
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.960
I'm going to put a gun in my ass right now.
Like you're tough shit.
I'm crazy.

688
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.880
I can't watch those.
I can't watch this.
This bit is actually though.
This is the,

689
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.240
it's the funniest and the least like crazy as it and there's,
there's nothing,

690
00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:47.230
you don't see anything being done.

691
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.040
You just see the guy go to the doctor and he goes to a Spanish speaking doctor

692
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.890
and they do an x ray and there's a twit card.
Is that,

693
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.490
and so it's the doctor just talking to them and he's like,

694
00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.870
and he's speaking Spanish the whole time and he's like,
ah,
I'm not to party.

695
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:07.520
Like telling somebody else that this guy was partying and he's like [inaudible]

696
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.230
cooler.
It's hilarious.
He told me it's a little car.
Rico,

697
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.760
is it cut ito?
It's like,
yeah.
Not like Carlito's way.
No,
no.

698
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.310
Got gotta eat those little call.
He,
here's a little card and his ass.

699
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.650
It's a toy car.
Does that,

700
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.930
that doesn't bother me as much as like when Johnny Knoxville after it was a

701
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:33.560
movie star movie star,
right.
He's doing fucking major motion pictures.
Yes.

702
00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.100
Puts

703
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.710
<v 3>a blindfold on and lets a bull,
it's crazy.</v>

704
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.200
Charge him and flip him through the air.
It's so crazy.

705
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.700
I know you the whole time you're like,
it is crazy that they're alive.
Fuck man,

706
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:46.460
that bull,
when that bowl launches him and you know,

707
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:48.020
he doesn't know where the ground is.
I mean,

708
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:51.580
I guess like you have a sense of gravity but he can't see you.

709
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.280
He's got a blindfold on so he literally has no idea.
And that bull,

710
00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:00.550
just by sheer luck doesn't stomp and madame or shove a horn through his ass hole

711
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:04.790
or,
or how about when he got,
I think of one of those,
you know,

712
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.280
it's one of these things mean,
you know,
it probably better than anybody.

713
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.810
He let's it,
he goes into like a
dude and like just,

714
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:16.700
let's like just let him unload and like get butter bean is not,

715
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:20.090
um,
obviously a super fit guy,

716
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:25.091
but he can throw fucking hammers and he's just punching him in the head.

717
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:30.380
Everything he's got bouncing off of and he's punching them into walls and shit,

718
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.170
you know.
And it was legal.

719
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.350
They did it because I need butter bean did one with them or he beat one of the

720
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:40.210
guys up.
I forget which one it was.
He knocked the guy out who was,

721
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.110
I don't know if it was John.
I don't think it was Johnny.

722
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.360
I don't think it was what was Johnny?
Knoxville.

723
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.230
And then there was the one where they had another guy go in with a female Moy

724
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.280
Thai fighter.
She was fucking fuck.
Goddamn too.

725
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.300
I'll take that over.
Butter bean me to butterbeans.
Goddamn terrifying.

726
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.150
That fucking dude hits hard.
Yeah.
He's fat as fuck.

727
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:03.710
But he's also a giant dude,
you know?
And if you stand right in front of them,

728
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.950
just,
you know how strong you have to be just to carry around all that weight.

729
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.310
Yeah.
Like if Ralphie may lost all that weight,

730
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.850
do you know how strong his legs would be?
Yeah,
he'd be,
cause he,
he's,

731
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.720
every time he stands up,
he's squatting,
whatever that entire,
yeah.

732
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.150
He's carrying 500 pounds and he walks down the street.

733
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.230
He's carrying 500 pounds.
You know,
that's the,

734
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.350
the amount of muscle strength that's required to do that.
I mean,

735
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:31.230
the pressure on his joints and his knees and crazy ankles and oh,

736
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.700
it's amazing that guys like that can even walk.
Yeah.
You know,

737
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.530
like when you see those,
I was at Disneyland recently and uh,
there,

738
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.930
there's people in the scooters like everywhere,
like everywhere you look,

739
00:43:41.931 --> 00:43:42.890
there's people in these scooters.

740
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:46.790
They're just overflowing on the sides of the scooters and you're like,

741
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.720
these people have just committed to eating so much.
And they're like,

742
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:54.410
you know what?
Fuck it.
I just,
I'm just going to motor around everywhere I go,

743
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.800
my joints,
they're just not designed for this.
My back's not designed for this,

744
00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.990
but I'm not going to fix anything.
I'm just going to keep eating.

745
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.440
I think they get overwhelmed by how far gone they are.
Yeah.

746
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.250
Because it's too hard to stop.
Too hard to stop.
It's too hard to stop.

747
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.280
And also part of the problem is that all your pleasure now comes from that.

748
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.610
Your pleasure comes from food.
Like I get a lot of pleasure from food.
Yeah,
sure.

749
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:17.081
You know,
it's,

750
00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:21.770
it's hard to pass up on some yummy food when someone like you pass by a hot dog

751
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:25.840
stand and you know,
you see the Sauerkraut and you smell the dogs,
he's like,
ah,

752
00:44:25.841 --> 00:44:27.080
I should go for one of those right now.

753
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.100
One of those sweet buns or smushy white bread bonds.
You,
it's all dog

754
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.530
<v 0>shits all terrible.
You know what you got me into,</v>

755
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.540
I blame you but it's not there anymore.

756
00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.400
But I did it with you a couple of times and I was like this.

757
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.980
And then I started to do it without you and pretend I'm you like,
uh,

758
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.070
when we would get back on flights from in the Delta terminal and that place that

759
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:50.940
used to have that chocolate croissant,
I'm talking about the one,

760
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.770
it's gone like that place shut down.

761
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:58.220
But we would go there on return flights and get a chocolate croissant and it was

762
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:02.520
like super rich,
like flaky.
It was buttery.
It was really buttery.

763
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.610
It was like a real good croissant.
Like the,
the,
the,
the,

764
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.600
the pastry part of it is very fluffy and buttery.
Yeah.

765
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.010
And the chocolate was,
you always get the most dog shit croissants on the planet.

766
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.600
Who?
Starbucks.
You said it right when I was saying it.
You knew I knew God.

767
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:22.890
Their croissants are dogs and they just,
they change.
They were even worse.

768
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.800
They up their game recently.
How recently?

769
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.220
Well I mean what was the last time you had one?
A couple months ago.
Oh really?

770
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:31.170
And that was the worst.
Horrible.
Oh Wow.

771
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:35.400
Cause if you had what they had last year it would be even more dramatically dog

772
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:35.700
shit.

773
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.700
This is Russian bakery that I go to and their croissants are fucking banging a

774
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:46.230
great buttery rich chocolate one.
This,
this place.
They make their own.

775
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.200
Yeah.
That's the key.
You have Starbucks,
they,

776
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.330
it comes in this little plastic thing and they open it up.

777
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.080
They hire a company that it become corporatized.
Like you don't have to do that.

778
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:59.370
Like you could make it in house or at least heat them up in house.

779
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:01.290
Like you have some delivered to you.

780
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:04.710
This Russian place I go do they sell coffee to and they have chocolate

781
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:07.740
croissants there.
I'll take you.
If you want to go,
oh,
I want to go.

782
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.880
We'll go after this.
I want to go take you.
It's not that far.
It's so good.

783
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.480
They're the best chocolate croissants I've ever had in my life.
Really?
Oh,

784
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.090
I'm so into it.
I go to a place near my place that,

785
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.100
that they bake them there and they can lay the chocolate and then it's like,

786
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.710
yeah,
it's these Russians.
They take it to another level.

787
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.910
They take it to another level.

788
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:27.020
They also put chocolate chips on top of the croissants,

789
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:30.120
stop it so they feel the inside of the croissant with chocolate chips.

790
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:33.330
It's melted down when they cook the croissant and then they put chocolate chips

791
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:37.830
on the top and then it's like a shiny glaze.
You bite into it.
It's like,
Oh,

792
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:39.750
Christ,
next level.

793
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.650
Next level from the place that was in the Delta terminal,

794
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.740
which was also a next level.
Yeah,
that was great,
man.
That was great.
You know,

795
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:51.510
and the thing is about,
but eating that rich food too is that now,
like for me,

796
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.340
I love food too.
I always get,

797
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:57.390
I get so much pleasure from food if I work out the way I've been working out now

798
00:46:57.391 --> 00:47:00.360
where I'm doing like pretty hard workouts.

799
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.410
I feel that thing where it's like your reward.
Oh yeah.
I can eat anything.

800
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:08.280
You know,
which I can but I do one yourself,
Tom?
Yeah.

801
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:14.090
Oh he was 16 he's a 26 ounce rib eye right now and it's waiting

802
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.770
butter butter on your buy.
I bought a little butter.
Oh yeah,
the garlic butter.

803
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:24.450
Yep.
Let it melt in there.
Cut into that flesh and have that butter.

804
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:29.160
Dip It in the buttocks.
Lobster,
Mac and cheese with truffle oil.

805
00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.040
Brand

806
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.960
<v 3>crumble.
How about different kinds of cheese too?
Oh yeah.</v>

807
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.790
Multiple different cheeses.
Yeah,

808
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.020
a good Mac and cheese,
like a really like tastefully done.

809
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:44.770
Gourmet Mac and cheese is fucking hard to pass up on where when you pull them

810
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:48.850
the Mac up the cheese strings,
the melted cheese is like clinging to the fork.

811
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:50.740
It's like,
oh one of those

812
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.840
<v 2>TLC did one of those shows where you know like the,</v>

813
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.180
the best Mac and cheese

814
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.250
<v 3>places in the car.</v>

815
00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:03.250
I almost checked off one like it was so good like it was so I was,

816
00:48:04.651 --> 00:48:09.570
I was so stuck on w I,
I couldn't feel my eyes away from the show.
So good.

817
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:14.430
It is places that just do Mac and cheese.
I bet they do.
Fox,

818
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.720
I get taste it right now.

819
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.020
What do we die?
What I was gluten free.

820
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.740
Those are the things that I missed was pasta.
I miss linguine with clams.

821
00:48:25.741 --> 00:48:29.010
Like a good linguine with clams is like,

822
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.080
that's how you know if her restaurants for real legit Italian spot.
Right.

823
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:37.230
They legit Italian restaurant has the linguine with clams.
It's not a soup.
Right,

824
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.860
okay.
Yeah.
It's just like a little,
it's a mild sauce,

825
00:48:40.861 --> 00:48:43.840
a white sauce with the Linguini just,

826
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.540
well you can chew the linguine.
It's got a little bit of a little chew to it.

827
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:48.960
Yeah.

828
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.960
And then the fucking clams have to be fresh and his little garlic and olive oil

829
00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:58.810
and old.
It was good.
I've been on this foodie kick

830
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.300
<v 2>on the road lately where I've been going to you just trying to find the best</v>

831
00:49:01.301 --> 00:49:05.620
restaurants in cities and every place seems to have a grilled octopus dish now

832
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.240
and I tear it up every time.
Grilled octopus is very good.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan.

833
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:13.330
I'm a big fan of it.
Yeah.
I've ordered two and one point I was like,

834
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.193
bring it another way.

835
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.710
<v 3>I'm sorry.
I'm like,
bring it out again.
That's,</v>

836
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.180
well that's one of the things though.
You're doing really well now.

837
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.800
You started making a lot of money on the road.

838
00:49:22.801 --> 00:49:25.110
You're doing very well and that's when the things you go,
you know what,

839
00:49:25.111 --> 00:49:28.060
I'm going to treat treatment.
Oh yeah,
it's bad.
I don't want to cheat myself.

840
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.200
<v 2>Upped my workouts and much more.
Yeah,
you were used to working out with Jesus.</v>

841
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.920
I am working out with just working out with them today to see that it,

842
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.000
<v 3>Tommy has a,
um,</v>

843
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.800
a trainer that will literally tell him how God wants him to work him out.

844
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.100
God wants me to push you to like tell me the time.
Then when he came in,

845
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:49.300
you were sick,
dude.
It's so bizarre.

846
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:50.740
So

847
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.810
<v 2>bizarre.
He's got it.
Dials it back.</v>

848
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:56.320
Sometimes I'll forget about it and then come up and I'll be like,
what?
Like,

849
00:49:56.321 --> 00:50:00.670
so this time I was,
I,
he's one of those people to,
you know,

850
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.770
the person that makes you feel like you're lying when you're not.
Yes.

851
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.690
Like he's one of those people where like I,

852
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.350
we had a workout scheduled and I could feel like,

853
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:15.100
like a respiratory thing coming on and I started to feel pretty bad.

854
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.400
So I called them and I go,
hey,
I don't thought,

855
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.440
I don't think we should work out tomorrow because I'm starting to,

856
00:50:22.441 --> 00:50:24.370
I'm starting to come down with something.
So it would be,

857
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.800
we could do it like later in life.
I should take a rest for a couple of days.

858
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.950
Well,
I mean,
like you're sick.
I'm like,
well,

859
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:34.670
I'm just feeling like I'm getting sick.
Hmm.
Yeah,
I mean,
you know,

860
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:39.620
maybe just like Kinda gargle some,
uh,
some like sea salt and that's what I do.

861
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.470
And then,
you know,
just get some sleep and then there's,
you know,

862
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:47.180
if you just don't want to do anything,
I'm like,
like,
like I'm not making this up.

863
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:51.710
You know,
like I,
I,
that sort of tone,
it's a tone of like accusatory.

864
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.580
It's like an accusatory.
Yeah.
It's an accusatory tone of like,
I mean,

865
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.880
are you just a quitter?
He like,
that's what's like behind it and you're like,

866
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.110
dude,
all right.

867
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.640
So the next day I ended up coming and I go,

868
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.710
Hey,
I think,
uh,
you know,
I,
you could hear it,
my voice,
like I,
you know,

869
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.250
is it my chest?
I go,
I think we should just like stick to weights today.

870
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.770
And he's like,
yeah,
cause he like your lungs.
I go,
yeah.

871
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:18.890
So we keep like my from breathing really hard,
you know,

872
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:23.030
cause I really doesn't feel good.
I didn't feel well at all.
And he's like,

873
00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:27.560
all right,
so we start off with some weights and then,
I don't know,

874
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:29.840
like 10 minutes in,
he's like,
bear,

875
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:34.841
crawl over to there and then bear crawl back and then do some burpees.

876
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:40.130
And I'm like,
all right,
I just start doing it and you know,
then I'm like,

877
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.740
I'm breathing heavier.
Right.
Cause you're like doing cardio stuff.

878
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.240
I'm starting to breathe heavier.
They didn't make me run downstairs.

879
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:50.030
It's like hit a heavy bag and then it's like just,
just ups the workout.

880
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:53.060
And so like 40 minutes into it,
I'm like,
yeah,

881
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:56.630
so much for like keeping the cardio down today.
Huh.
And he was like,
well,

882
00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.493
you know,

883
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:03.130
I was doing that first and then I kind of started to push you a little bit and

884
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:05.810
you could do it.
And then I,
you know,
the Holy Spirit,

885
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:07.990
you kind of like tap me and was like,
you know,
like,

886
00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:10.430
like a little tap on the shoulder like,
you know,
right now,

887
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:12.560
just pull back a little bit.
So he'll let me know if I,

888
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:15.380
if I'm ever going to far like it'll,
it'll just give me a,

889
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:17.630
he'll give me like a warning and I was like,

890
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.800
<v 3>all right man,
like I don't even know this guy in your act yet.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

891
00:52:22.801 --> 00:52:27.380
yeah,
yeah.
When am I,

892
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.590
when can I see you again next?

893
00:52:28.591 --> 00:52:32.160
I haven't seen your act in probably like when's the last time you worked

894
00:52:32.161 --> 00:52:35.840
together?
Six months.
No,
cause we did.
Um,
we did,
we did this house.

895
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.690
We did ice house,
but we did Vegas not too long.
That's right.
That's right.

896
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.820
That's right.
But those are weird cause like you're always,

897
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:44.220
everyone gets distracted like offstage.
Right.

898
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.870
Does I didn't see your set that time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I mean I just,
you know,

899
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.110
that's also a place where you can't see.
That's the coffee at her.
I couldn't get,

900
00:52:52.111 --> 00:52:55.140
just did it.
Right.
I just did it last Friday.
How was it?
It was great.

901
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:59.130
Crazy drunks crazy.
Oh my God.
It was fun.
It's always fun,

902
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.630
but there's a lot of fucking maniacs and the audience's time this really crazy.

903
00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:06.210
Yeah,
it was pretty crazy.
Um,
yeah that started right away.

904
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.870
Ian Edwards went on stage and like the first thing they do,
they just started,

905
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.100
it was like a few people that were just hecklers.
You're just,
they,

906
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:16.740
you know what it was too.
It was a light weekend for the fights.

907
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.890
It wasn't that many people there and it was a light weekend for my show and they

908
00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:23.340
gave away some comps and when they give away comps,
that's never good.

909
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:26.040
It doesn't matter if it's 2000 or a hundred

910
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.240
<v 2>seat place cops when they say what places?
Yeah,
they w w the gay boy,</v>

911
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.270
a couple of hundred free tickets.
Wow.
That's all you need to do.

912
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.660
Then it goes crazy.
You're going to have a Leech 20 animals.

913
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.310
You give away a hundred free tickets,
you got 10 animals now,
oddly enough,
the um,

914
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:46.020
the last,
the Mcgregor fight weekend that,
that was awesome.

915
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.430
That was beyond us and we were preparing for,
for massacre.

916
00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.560
Like I really,
yeah,

917
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:58.650
they were great,
but also like it fed itself.

918
00:53:58.651 --> 00:54:01.980
The nervousness was like we talked about,
I think it was just a real brief,

919
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:05.070
like could be real crazy tonight and that's all I needed to hear.

920
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:08.940
And like I was just imagining 2000 Irish drugs,
like fuck,

921
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.530
like just screaming at me.
And so I was really like prepared for like,
oh,

922
00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:17.070
this can be bad.
You know,
I went into it like that,
which maybe is why it was,

923
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.890
I felt so good because it was the opposite of that.

924
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:23.310
Well that was a great crowd though.
They were really,
they were a remarkable,

925
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:24.144
we're so good.

926
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.960
I mean it just like you would never have imagined there was 2000 people in that

927
00:54:27.961 --> 00:54:30.660
room in 2000 plus or whatever the fuck it seats.
It will,

928
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:34.500
it seemed like it was intimate.
Like they were,
they were great.

929
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.670
Oh they were just excited about that weekend.

930
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.440
Do you know what the Jesus trainer also did recently was a,
we were doing,

931
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.020
well there's a,
there's a type of rack where you can squat,

932
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:46.020
but it also has arms that go out this way so you can,

933
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.740
it basically puts it at hip level and do like power cleans and stuff off of it.

934
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.450
So it's on there.
The bars on there and he's having me change out,

935
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.540
go up by tens so it's like 10 on each side and then 20 and 30 and 40 50 and I

936
00:54:59.771 --> 00:55:03.180
was like,
should I use the bigger weights?
Cause we're just adding tens.

937
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.590
And he's like,
no.
Okay.
And then he's like,
you know what,

938
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:12.210
take them all off and now start putting on bigger ways.
I'm like,
all right,

939
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.670
so I have six tens like on each side.

940
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.700
So I take those all off and I put 45 and then 25.
Then he's like,

941
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.640
and then after a while he's like,
how's that good,
we keep going up.
And he's like,

942
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.080
yeah,
yeah,
I go,
what?
And he's like,
Holy Spirit was,
uh,

943
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.433
told me that like

944
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.410
to have you use the bigger weights for your risks.

945
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:38.820
I know sometimes you have problem with your risks.

946
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.150
So I think by you moving around those heavier weights,

947
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:43.080
it's better for your wrist.

948
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:46.980
But it was the holy spirit that told him to have me stop doing the lighter

949
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:51.360
weights and use the bigger way you risk get sore sometimes.
Like sometimes,

950
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:55.710
you know,
um,
my wrist,
I think,
I feel like I have like just weak wrists,

951
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.970
like in general.
So I have sometimes I have some pain there.
Or,
um,

952
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.210
like with w with power cleans,
you know,
instead of like having them underneath,

953
00:56:03.211 --> 00:56:06.360
like I have like maybe a limited range with them,

954
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.300
but as far as like how far it goes back.
Yeah.
So it,

955
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:14.100
it hurts sometimes and I'll have like suggested maybe I should get,
you know,

956
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.270
those traps [inaudible] traps or something.
What we should,

957
00:56:17.271 --> 00:56:20.660
we just had conversations about it,
but you know,
um,
what,

958
00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.860
what can help as well is,
um,
there's

959
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.120
<v 1>some mobility exercises to stretch out your risks.</v>

960
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:30.040
That could help a lot for most people.
If you,

961
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:33.440
if you live your life up to a certain point and you've never really,
uh,

962
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:38.200
pushed him,
they have a limited range of motion,
which is based on it,
but you can,

963
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.280
you could change that range of motion with stretching.
Um,

964
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.100
but another thing that can help the strength of them is,
uh,

965
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:48.240
do you ever have a roller?
Do you know what that is?
Like you have a,
a,

966
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:52.060
a stick and there's a long string on the bottom of it and then you put a weight

967
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.160
at the bottom of the string and then you roll it up.
I've seen those.
Yeah.

968
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:58.780
It's a great for strengthening the wrist and strengthening the forearm as well.

969
00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.860
Those are really good for that.

970
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.400
If you ever read that forearm strength is hereditary isn't,

971
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.550
that's what I've read.
I don't know if it's,
if it's true or not.
I mean,

972
00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:07.960
obviously you can work on it,
but,
but you know,

973
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:11.950
some people just have that like natural,
incredible strength,

974
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.050
like forearm strength,
like with a grip.
Yeah.

975
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:16.370
Well it's also the size of the hands.
Yeah.
You know,

976
00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:19.480
that that has a big factor because if you have small hands,

977
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.020
very difficult to have.
Strong forearms are strong hands.
If they're small,

978
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.040
they're small.
Well,
it's like there's leverage in having a larger hand,

979
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:29.520
like guys have like this big Kareem Abdul Jabbar,

980
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.740
like Shaquille O'Neal must have like a grip of death.
Like I,

981
00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.450
she shaked Shaquille O'Neal's hand,

982
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.200
my hand disappears in his hand and it becomes like a little child saying,
yeah,

983
00:57:38.201 --> 00:57:42.040
yeah.
I noticed even in like his stature is not as big.
You know,

984
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:46.780
he's only like five,
nine or 10 but that with,
with Tyson.
Oh yeah.
His,
his,

985
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.910
his hand went around my hand.
Well he's got a fucking hammer.
Fists,

986
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:56.410
you know.
And when you have a thicker,
like longer fingers,

987
00:57:56.411 --> 00:57:58.000
it's like in Jujitsu,

988
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.810
one of the things that a is a big advantage is having a longer limbs.

989
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.630
Like guys who are long like this,
this Guy Heidrick Gracie,

990
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:09.220
he's long and tall and he finishes a lot of guys with arm armbars and triangles

991
00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:13.450
and he has all this extra leverage because he has length and for chokes,

992
00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.470
guys with long arms are really good a lot of times and getting chokes off their

993
00:58:17.471 --> 00:58:21.550
back like triangle chokes and chokes from because they have more length of their

994
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:23.740
bone.
They have like a longer,
there's a long,

995
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.700
there's more leverage and get around.
So it makes sense with hands too.

996
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:30.940
Like someone would like longer hands.
It's more,
they can crush you more.

997
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:35.500
There's more there.
But like little hands,
like you're fucked.
Like,

998
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:39.250
like people with little hands,
very difficult for them to generate power.

999
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:42.520
You can be fast and there's a certain amount of power involved in speed.

1000
00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:44.590
But like a George Foreman,

1001
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.500
one of the things that people like apparently George Foreman,

1002
00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:50.950
I never shook his hand,
but it's like shaking it canned ham.
Oh.

1003
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.870
Cause I was just fucking monstrous again.
Club have a hand.
Well he was just,

1004
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.960
that was just a fucking sledgehammer that would come on.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

1005
00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:02.650
That's one of the reasons why,
but the human body like vary so much.

1006
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:07.250
I mean there's so many different things that are definitely genetically like it

1007
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.160
there advan advantageous.

1008
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:12.940
It's one of the weird things about the argument when it comes to steroids are no

1009
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:16.580
steroids or a performance enhancing drugs.
Yeah.

1010
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:21.800
Like there are advantages to being born with certain genetics for giant

1011
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.300
<v 3>advantages.
I have small ions.
They're not tiny.
They're not tiny,</v>

1012
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:28.940
but they're pretty small.
It's pretty average.

1013
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:35.620
I think it's might be like we might fit the actual measurements of the National

1014
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:39.400
American Societies for Sig meetings now for average Dick for average.
Yeah.

1015
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.150
Not like that Mexican dude.
How big you think his hands are?
How,
how if you could,

1016
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.320
if you,
if you had his dick,
it wouldn't be good.
Right.

1017
00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:48.290
But his hands are like those big phone number ones.

1018
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:55.100
Would you want a Dick like that?
No,
but if you can shape the perfect Dick,

1019
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:59.060
listen,
what measurements would,
my Dick could have been a disaster.

1020
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:01.790
Everybody's Dick could have been designed and we've all met people with birth

1021
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:06.590
defects,
all sorts of,
I'm very happy with my deck,
but if you could shape wicked,

1022
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.680
I won't even enter this conversation when enter the conversation.
Great.
Yeah.

1023
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:14.380
I'm a fan.
I like mine.
I like the worst man.
Yeah.

1024
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.930
Of Micro Dick's and there's not a goddamn thing in the world they can do about

1025
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:20.840
that.
And that's,
and that is really fucking sad.

1026
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.530
It's so sad and it's real and there's,
there's nothing they do.

1027
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.990
There's nothing they can do.
We've all seen,

1028
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.600
like I went to see this guy once in a concert.

1029
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:32.450
He took his pants off and he's called,

1030
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.480
he calls himself extreme Elvis and part of his gag was that he has the tiny

1031
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:40.070
stick you've ever seen.
I mean,
his Dick is like,

1032
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:45.290
and I'm not bullshitting his dick is like the bottom two digits on my pinky.

1033
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.700
Really?
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's,

1034
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.980
it's so small and this guy would take off his clothes and he would,

1035
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.180
he was owning it.
Right.
He was trying to just own it up.
Yeah.
That was his,

1036
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:56.930
that sucks.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1037
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:01.040
He's fucking talented as shit to really like really good singer,
great band.

1038
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:04.490
And uh,
it was a crazy show.
He would,
um,

1039
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.430
he would take off his clothes and he would piss on the audience.

1040
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:11.840
He would pee on people.
Um,
he would,
uh,
pice is GG Allen now.

1041
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:14.570
He had this girl that he was,
uh,
his,
uh,
his was,

1042
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.530
she was a singer and she would take her top off Chad,
great tits to,
she's pretty,

1043
01:01:18.531 --> 01:01:19.341
and she was talented.

1044
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:22.700
She was like a talented musician and he would pee in her mouth.
He's like,
oh.

1045
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.400
He was like,
who wants to drink for King's pissed?
She's like,
I do.
I do.

1046
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:29.510
Any pissing her mouth.
What?
What's his name?
Extreme Elvis.
Jesus man.

1047
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.560
Because GC you've seen tangible stuff,
right?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1048
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:37.340
He would smear shit on people.
He had a little Dick.
Yeah.
And he didn't happen.

1049
01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:40.400
Parade.
That should around.
Yeah.
Maybe that's where all the rage came from.

1050
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:44.780
I bet it has something to do with it.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
for sure.

1051
01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:45.740
It has something to do with it.

1052
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.280
A lot of people's rage comes from being fucked with and from.

1053
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:53.660
Also feeling the inequality.
You know,
you feel like you got fucked.

1054
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:57.550
Like you've got a shitty hand.
Goddamn.
And look at these fucking two ones.

1055
01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:01.040
This motherfucker's got a full house.
Yeah,
that's true.

1056
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:06.200
I think my best hands fucking bullshit.
God dammit.
God dammit.

1057
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.230
That's life micro Dick,
my crowd deck.

1058
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.650
And there's not as a whole damn thing they could do about it for now.

1059
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.060
But the day they fix it,

1060
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:18.290
oh we're going to have a lot of those Mexican dudes around.
Oh dear.
She had been,

1061
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:21.880
I did used to do about big Dick Pills.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've seen it.
I've seen it.
Yeah,

1062
01:02:21.881 --> 01:02:25.200
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Little my best bits.
Yeah.
That was great.
Big Dick Pills.
Yeah,

1063
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:30.590
but that,
that is more doing big Dick Surgery at Wichita.

1064
01:02:30.591 --> 01:02:33.390
But I saw a thing one time,

1065
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.160
a video on it where like that shit looked.
So what happened on the video?

1066
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:42.810
I saw the guy got like the,
the injections and everything.
It just looked um,

1067
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.770
like a,
like a rubber sleeve,
but there were no veins in anymore,
you know,

1068
01:02:47.771 --> 01:02:51.000
it was just like,
and I don't think it got hard,
it just was,

1069
01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.200
it was big and doughy and,
and like,
like half full.

1070
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.270
It was like a bigger limp dick,
but it looked fucking weird.

1071
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:03.390
So he would just like smack people to,
yeah,
check out this big soft click.

1072
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:07.980
Fuck you.
You Ain't
God.

1073
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:12.840
Yeah.
18 inches though.
They can't do a damn thing about a micro Dick,

1074
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.200
which is amazing.
They figured out a way to make it hard.

1075
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.960
That's one thing they figured out pour that changed the world.

1076
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:23.970
The guy who figured out Cialis and Viagra,
that guy must have made so much.

1077
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.040
Oh my goodness,
I'm out of money.
They must be doing that stuff.
Oh my God.

1078
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.580
It's vasodilators,
right?
They figured out a way to,

1079
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.630
and you know those are banned from the Olympics.
Did you know that?
Really?

1080
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.480
See what they open your capillary.
Well,
they help performance.

1081
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.590
They help your endurance.
You get more blood.
Yeah.
Just totally makes sense.

1082
01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:48.870
But I think that if you could figure out a way to actually make something,

1083
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.640
we're dude's Dick [inaudible] grew,

1084
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.750
it would probably be the most,

1085
01:03:55.290 --> 01:04:00.100
the most lucrative investment ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was there,

1086
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:04.710
because everybody,
even if like you're thrilled with your dead,
someone was like,

1087
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.060
yeah,
that's fun.
Just try one.
You're going to,
you're going to buy it out an inch.

1088
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:12.110
Yeah.
You wouldn't want another extra inch.
An inch.
Yeah.
Come on.
Just you.

1089
01:04:12.111 --> 01:04:15.810
You're like,
I'll take it.
You're happy with it,
right?
You thrilled.
Yeah.

1090
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.320
Are you thrilled?
And they start getting like agents as the salesman,
like,

1091
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.210
you know,
they're all sales.
So I was like,

1092
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.200
get fucking all the agents in there and being like,
speaking of lucrative.

1093
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.130
I was with,

1094
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:30.420
with Ian Edwards this weekend and know Greg Fitzsimmons and Ian and I were a

1095
01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:34.100
flying home and we were at the terminal and we ran into this girl that,
uh,

1096
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.120
Ian knew,
uh,
from the store and apparently she's a stripper.
And,
uh,
she,

1097
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:41.820
uh,
we were sitting down having a coffee and she asked if she could sit with us.

1098
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:43.260
I said,
yeah,
sure,
go ahead.
Sit with us.

1099
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.100
And so she started talking about working at spearmint,
rhino,

1100
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.540
stripping and this and that.

1101
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.030
And she worked this weekend and she was coming back and you know,

1102
01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.470
she was just talking about,
you know,
everybody was cheap and this and that,

1103
01:04:55.471 --> 01:04:58.890
that and this.
And then she said she was working with this girl.

1104
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.880
She's working with this girl and the girl.
Uh,
I go,
I go,

1105
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:07.650
what percentage of the girls that you work with are willing to have sex with

1106
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:12.300
guys for money?
And she's like,
um,
there's quite a few.
She goes,

1107
01:05:12.301 --> 01:05:16.830
I worked with this one girl this weekend who was like,
how lucrative do you get?

1108
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.920
And she goes,
what?
She goes,

Cause I get,

1109
01:05:21.921 --> 01:05:22.990
I be getting lucrative.

1110
01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.660
And and she goes,
what do you mean lucrative?
Says I'll go,

1111
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:35.350
I'll go back to a dude's hotel room for $1,000.
I'll get lucrative,

1112
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:38.980

1113
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:44.730
And this girl was married to a guy apparently that is not gay but is a dancer.

1114
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.150
She dances for men and he does,
he's gay for pay.
Yeah,
he's gay.
It's a,

1115
01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:55.980
her husband is her husband.
He's like five guys were on a train off.

1116
01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:01.270
It's so fucking unacceptable,
dude.
Hey,

1117
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.010
one night he doesn't have to work for the rest of the month.
Okay,
how's that?
How,

1118
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.070
how's your sleep?
Are you sleeping well?

He's lucrative.

1120
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:22.090
I saw that like a MTV.
Oh,

1121
01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.780
They did that when the guy where he was like,
I'm not gay and these six guys,

1122
01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:30.520

I saw that and they were all clowning him.

1123
01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:33.640
Do you remember that?
They were all openly gay and they were like,
dude,

1124
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.710

He had a girlfriend too,

1126
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.040

I don't like it,
but it's really his job.

1127
01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:45.840
And his Crawford was like kind of homely and he's a good looking guy.
Yeah.

1128
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.440
And I remember the line that he had to say in the video,
anal sex is the bomb.

1129
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.850
That's what he had to say before the Jews ran a train on him.
Fuck man.

1133
01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:12.210

Yeah,
she could tell me more crazy stories.

1134
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.480
More lucrative stories.
How lucrative do you get?

1135
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.160
What's that?
Um,

1136
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:23.910
stripper stripper fees like with strippers said or something you don't talking

1137
01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:27.460
about.
Yeah,

God Damn it.
Pretty funny.
I met,

1138
01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:29.890

1139
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:34.980
it works for that feed has a buddy that fights in the UFC and so I go back and

1140
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:41.350
forth.
I do it sometimes on a,
on Twitter because I follow them.
Yeah.

1141
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.650
Stripper genius.
Yes.
Yes.
It's a little bit,

1142
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:46.270
some of this shit is hilarious on their feed.

1143
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.990
I can't wait to be completely done dancing because I'm sick of digging my

1144
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:54.520
fucking t bar out of my ass crack all night.
That's kind of mild.
Yeah,

1145
01:07:54.521 --> 01:07:57.100
it's mild,
but there's some good ones in there.
There's some good ones in here.

1146
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:02.370
Stripper genius fall that on the Twitter I'm with my new guy said no more

1147
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:05.320
masturbating for me.
Okay,
here it is.

1148
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.790
Maybe if you ate a burger,
you'd have some ass and titties.

1149
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:13.030
I've done cocaine with a lot of rock stars.
Too many.
Really?

1150
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:19.980
I'm sorry if my breath smells like tomatoes and liquor.
I like that.
Uh,

1151
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.020
uh,
there are two.
There's too many bitches and not enough sluts.
Amen.
Sister

1152
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.770
fucking booty calling a hoe just to get bitched out is depressing and I'm using

1153
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.770
all right.
It's like a Dick for some pizza right now.
These are all good.

1154
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.080
They're not bad.
There's good ones in there,
but you got to fish for them.

1155
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.430
They should post a less quality over quantity because some of those are just not

1156
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.660
that interesting.
Yeah,
but some of them are,

1157
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:51.200
but the good thing is they're all real like they're not like,

1158
01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:55.400
there's not like a comedy writer who's like trying to find out what the funniest

1159
01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:56.780
shit that a stripper could say.

1160
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.810
So they should use that on stripper genius though.

1161
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.410
How lucrative for you will it again please.
How lucrative the you get.

1162
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.490
I get put in lucrative man.

1163
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.840
You imagine a girl like a Rosie Perez accent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,

1164
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.820
that's the perfect person to say it.
I go real liquidity.

1165
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:18.470
How lucrative are you willing to get getting back in the day?
Yeah.

1166
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.700
Put that phone down Tommy addicted.
You're just searching for more,
right?
Yes.

1167
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.670
Super Addictive.
You should.
Fear has a really good fucking point.

1168
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:29.770
I'm not following them into the abyss.
Of of the flip phone but he's like in,

1169
01:09:29.771 --> 01:09:31.340
in the morning,
in the morning.

1170
01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.980
I would wear this to half an hour every morning or just get off.

1171
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:38.300
But your first book or dropped my Twitter.
He's right.
He's right.
I do it.

1172
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.440
I take my morning shit.

1173
01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:43.010
I get excited to bring that phone into the bathroom and do the exact same thing.

1174
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.383
That shit.

1175
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.840
I'll walk towards the bathroom be like oh I forgot that shit turn around.

1176
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.780
Cause there's some people's Twitter feeds that are fun.
I want to follow him.

1177
01:09:50.781 --> 01:09:51.320
I don't want to fun.

1178
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.040
And there's always like some new news story or some interesting things going on.

1179
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.840
Most of my news from a Twitter feed,
you know in the bathroom.
Yeah.
Cause I got,

1180
01:09:59.841 --> 01:10:03.710
I'll follow breaking news New York Times,
like what's going on right now?
Yeah.

1181
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:07.280
Oh yeah.
Rip West Craven.
Fuck.
That's how I found out.

1182
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:09.350
What's the trending stuff for sure.

1183
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.530
That's how I found Robin Williams died last winter and Robin Williams.

1184
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:17.210
I was like what?
Yeah,
no way.
That one didn't feel real.
Yeah,

1185
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.830
I remember I saw that written down or IP.
Robin Williams was like,
what?

1186
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.450
Crazy that one year just passed on that I couldn't believe it.
Yeah,
it flew,

1187
01:10:26.451 --> 01:10:29.090
right?
Yeah,
it did.
That's one thing that you'll find,

1188
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:34.091
especially once your kid is born time accelerate every year quicker every year.

1189
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:40.640
Like your kids were babies.
Like I feel like yesterday.
I do.
Yeah,

1190
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.970
and your kids w it's going to be the same thing with you and then one day

1191
01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:48.260
they're going to be off to college.
Sorry off.
You know,
being an adult,

1192
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:52.950
how old now?
How old are you arriving in?
Five.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird.
It's,

1193
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.690
it's real weird watching other people's kids grow up too.
And also,

1194
01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.860
here's another thing that's weird.

1195
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.960
Watching people's bad parenthood skills manifest themselves and their kids.

1196
01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.813
You see it.

1197
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.550
I have a friend who's got a fucking eight year old is still sucks his thumb and

1198
01:11:07.551 --> 01:11:10.820
he thinks it's okay.
He's like,
it's some big deal.
I go,
no,
it's a big deal.

1199
01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:15.120
Like your kids sucking his thumb.
Yeah.
Like this is not like healthy behavior.

1200
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:17.190
You're not supposed to be sucking your thumb when you're eight,

1201
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.960
you're kid's going to get fucked with.

1202
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.050
He's getting get fucked with by other kids in school if he's not already getting

1203
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:25.620
fucked with like that's just weird.
You start,
um,

1204
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:27.390
I started paying attention more.
You know,

1205
01:11:27.391 --> 01:11:31.200
you started to key into things more like we're at a restaurant and now when we

1206
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:36.201
see like you're sitting next to a table where it's a family and they have the

1207
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:38.520
kid and the kid's like seven,

1208
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:43.521
eight and he's on an iPad with the volume up either watching a video or playing

1209
01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:49.800
a game and you're hearing people beautiful and you're sitting here like they are

1210
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:54.180
teaching him that.
That's okay.
Like be entitled,

1211
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.280
be oblivious and like,

1212
01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.880
how are you not telling them we're in a restaurant right now,
you know,

1213
01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:03.970
at least if you're going to check out and play games,
bring them.

1214
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.700
No one wants to hear the explosions.

1215
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:10.620
But I start to pick up on that more like there that that's why that when that

1216
01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:12.720
guy grows up and he's oblivious to like,
Whoa,

1217
01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:15.750
what's everyone's problem that I'm doing fucking whatever I want.

1218
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.840
No matter who's around me all the time.
Cause they put it in them,

1219
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:21.180
they let them know it's okay.
No one told them like,
no,

1220
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:24.200
you have to be considerate of the people around you.
Well,

1221
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:27.930
electronics are so unnatural to,
uh,
we all love them.
You know,

1222
01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:31.950
everybody loves a good movie or everybody loves to look at their phone or check

1223
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:34.620
their email.
It's for whatever reason,
it's compelling.

1224
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:38.790
But there is so unnatural that when you're all sitting around a dinner table and

1225
01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:41.610
there's five people and everyone's like staring at an Ipad,

1226
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.530
see it all the time now.
Yeah.
At least a phone.
Yeah.
You know,
but for little kids,

1227
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:50.010
what it is,
is there,
kids are hard to tune into that.
They,
they,

1228
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.040
they care about shit.
You don't give a fuck about like a,

1229
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.990
I took my kids out for breakfast this morning and,
uh,

1230
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.250
we're sitting around and we're,
we're coloring.
You know,
a lot of times when you,

1231
01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:02.580
uh,
go to a restaurant,
they have a kids menu and they give you some crayons.

1232
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.300
So we're drawing,
you know,
and they want to,
but she's like,

1233
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:09.390
can I play with your phone?
Like,
no,
let's just do this.
Let's just do this.

1234
01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:13.470
Let's do this.
But that fucking phone is better.
What age do you give him a phone?

1235
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:17.430
I don't know.
That's a good question.
That's a good question.

1236
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:22.500
I think that age changes when a right,
yeah.
That you can,

1237
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.490
there's a new thing that they have for kids.
It's like a wristband.

1238
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.200
The ILEC all,
almost like a watch type thing that has a tracking device on it.

1239
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.560
Tell you what your kids are all the time and there's a button they press on.

1240
01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:38.100
It will,
it will call you only you sound a phone,

1241
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.890
but it call you like dad.

1242
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:43.440
He left me over by pirates of the Caribbean and lost and then you got to go find

1243
01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:46.920
your kid.
Do they have that?
Yeah.
Wow.
They have that.
Wow.
That's cool.

1244
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:49.950
And then like that's step one when your kids are going to be calling you all the

1245
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:54.030
time.
Yeah.
Pressing that button.
Dad.
I Hate Second Grade Bullshit,

1246
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.810
dad.
I don't want to go to school.
Dad,

1247
01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:02.760
you're gonna get that a lot or not.
Maybe they love it.
That's true.

1248
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.553
Yeah.
They could.

1249
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.250
The idea that a kid is supposed to be thinking about what they want to do for

1250
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:12.130
their future,
those crazy,
like there's people that are prepping their kid

1251
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.690
<v 1>for whatever.</v>

1252
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:16.900
I remember that future I remember cause I went to school with that were being

1253
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:19.540
prepped for med school in,
in elementary school.

1254
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:23.350
So I think it's kind of fucked up for you and I more than anybody else,

1255
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:28.410
especially because we actually love what we do and what we do is so discouraged.

1256
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.340
Yeah,
true.
But nobody says,
Tommy,

1257
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.070
you should really be a standup comedian.
No,

1258
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:41.310
just start fucking with your teachers.
Now
is there any kid in class,

1259
01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:45.780
it really stands out as being annoying.
Can you imitate him?
Yeah,

1260
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:46.580
yeah,
yeah.

1261
01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:50.230
Start imitating them and put them in ridiculous scenarios like in Napoleon's

1262
01:14:50.231 --> 01:14:54.190
army.
And I'll
start doing an impression.

1263
01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:57.250
If you think of something funny to say in a really serious moment in class,

1264
01:14:57.251 --> 01:15:01.150
just blurt that shit out.
Yeah.
If you can get a laugh in class.

1265
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.950
That was the Sharon math class.
Oh,

1266
01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:04.990
that was the greatest thing that we had a thing.

1267
01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:09.991
And when I was in fifth grade where like if you got in trouble in the first part

1268
01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:13.110
of the day,
you didn't go get to go to recess,
you know?

1269
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.850
And then recess is like everything.
Recess is like,
Hey,

1270
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:18.910
do you want to go to Fiji to adult,
you're a kid.
And they're just like,

1271
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:20.470
recess is a fucking shit.

1272
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.810
And I remember like biting my lower lip and be like,
Oh,
if I say this,

1273
01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:29.630
I'm my God,
we get taken out of recess.
But then I'd be like,
ah,

1274
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:32.800
just say it anyways.
And then it's like,
no recess,
you know?

1275
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.330
But like it was worth it to,
to make everybody in stupid class laugh.

1276
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:41.140
I wasn't funny in school,
like with things I said,

1277
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.540
but I would draw things that were funny.

1278
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:47.170
I would draw cartoons like we had this guy,
Mr. White,
Mr. White was crazy.

1279
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:52.120
He went to Vietnam and bad things happened to him over there.
Really?
Apparently.

1280
01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:55.320
Yeah,
he was shell shocked.
That's what we used to call it back then before they,

1281
01:15:55.321 --> 01:15:59.860
he's called PTSD,
but a,
he was a real tiny guy.
He was like five too.

1282
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:03.940
So every time I would draw I would draw him standing out box or standing on a

1283
01:16:03.941 --> 01:16:07.180
chair or standing on a stool and he would,
uh,

1284
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.800
like someone asked for a pencil once and uh,
he goes,
you want to pencil?

1285
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.300
He goes,
come here,
come over here.
And he takes the drawer from his desk.

1286
01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:20.980
He Yanks it out,
it's got pencils in it and slams it on the ground and he goes,

1287
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:24.850
take one of those pencils.
Holy Shit.
And everybody was like,
what the fuck?

1288
01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:27.580
And we all knew that this guy had been to Vietnam.

1289
01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:30.850
Like he would talk about it occasionally,
you know,

1290
01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.390
that's pretty terrifying to do the,
he was,
you know,

1291
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:38.560
in a good school system to,
well this was Newton south high school.
Okay.

1292
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.970
So Newton south high school,

1293
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:43.750
it's like they did bus kids in from bad neighborhoods and that,

1294
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.830
that was an issue because they did bring these kids in from like Dorchester and

1295
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:49.750
Matt,
a Pan,
like really bad neighborhoods.

1296
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.910
And there was definitely a difference,
which are,
and everybody's like,
oh,

1297
01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.720
like these lambs of,
of these,
uh,
suburban lambs and then these,
uh,

1298
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.210
urban wolves that would come into the city,
but it wasn't too bad,
you know,

1299
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:09.530
it wasn't like gangs or anything crazy.
And this was like,
I went to high school,

1300
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:14.531
I graduated in 85 and that was before like rap music is before,

1301
01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:18.380
like straight out of Compton and all that crazy shit.

1302
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:20.780
Where were things like escalated,
right?

1303
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:25.700
Like violence and like rap music,
no matter what anybody says,

1304
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.760
absolutely perpetrated like a different sort of acceptable mentality or a up,

1305
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.780
a different sort of behavior they aspire towards.

1306
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.020
That wasn't going on when I was in high school.
So when I was in high school,

1307
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.270
like Sugar Hill gang was like the big thing,
right?

1308
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.590
There was like junior high school,
I said the hip hop hip to the hippity hip hop.

1309
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.310
It was,
it wasn't that kind of the kind of music that was,
you know,

1310
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:53.870
it just wasn't gangster rap,
gangster rap score,
chase bank,
Hank,
um,

1311
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:58.820
forgot what my point was.
Uh,
they were just,
they weren't that bad in this guy.

1312
01:17:58.821 --> 01:17:59.420
So this guy,

1313
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.320
Mr. White was growing up in this neighborhood and in this neighborhood it really

1314
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:08.200
was,
you know,
wasn't,
it wasn't like a dangerous play.

1315
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:12.350
Sure.
But he would fucking freak out and was a good dude though.

1316
01:18:12.351 --> 01:18:14.690
He was a really nice guy and he's a very smart guy too.

1317
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:17.720
Like I had some really interesting conversations with a moves,
very aware,

1318
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:21.620
but he just had a trigger that will,
he took a joke really well.

1319
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.190
They'll tell you that man,
I never got upset at my cartoons.
Really?
He laughed.

1320
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:27.280
Thought they were funny,
man.
Dude.

1321
01:18:27.281 --> 01:18:31.880
But it's funny when you grow up to think of your teachers as people as opposed

1322
01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:35.480
to like when you're a student and a kid,
teachers are like,
you know,

1323
01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:38.540
you don't imagine your parents are people,
they're your parents.

1324
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.910
And teachers have like that special place that like,
that's Mr. White.
Yeah.

1325
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:46.310
And you say they're like their names,
like,
I dunno,
like it just,

1326
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.630
and you grow up and you're like,
oh,
that was a miserable fucking guy.
Like he,

1327
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:54.260
like,
I remember teachers that were just hate,
like clearly hated teaching,

1328
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:58.860
you know?
Yeah.
There was a lot of those man.
Yeah,
there was a lot of,
you know,

1329
01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.590
there's no money in it.
There's no money in it.

1330
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:05.300
You imagine just dealing with a new crop of asshole teenagers every year that

1331
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:08.000
don't give a fuck about you.
But I,
you know,

1332
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:11.570
one of the things that really bummed me out man was people that would say like

1333
01:19:11.571 --> 01:19:16.571
negative shit to kids and not realize the impact that negative shit has on that.

1334
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.720
I got,
I,
uh,
I've told this before,
I think when I was in,

1335
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.040
this was the only laugh I think I ever got in high school in the,
in the class,

1336
01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:27.530
but I got kicked out for it.
My teacher,

1337
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:32.450
she was black and she got a terrible accent and she's taking teaching math and,

1338
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:36.110
uh,
I was not paying attention and,
uh,

1339
01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.840
probably talking and she was missing or broken.

1340
01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:41.990
Would you like to come up here and do both of these questions for this class?

1341
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.500
And a,
I said,
would you like me to do both of those questions?

1342
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:49.730
And the fucking pool.
It was just like,
there was like a pause like no he did.

1343
01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:54.690
And then
like everybody started and then she goes and she goes,
you know,
get,

1344
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:57.650
she kicks me out and she goes,
don't laugh.
Go ahead.

1345
01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:01.910
You know Mister Brogan is going nowhere in life.
I'll tell you this right now.

1346
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.440
And then she kicked me out of the class.

1347
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.560
I remember thinking that like what a rude thing to say to a 14 year old who by

1348
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:09.700
the way you may be teaching math,
but yeah,

1349
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:13.500
you might want to learn work on English because that's not how you say both.

1350
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:18.090
You don't say both.
There's not an f in there.
So when you save itself and I,

1351
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.660
all I did was say,
would you like me to do both of those questions?

1352
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:25.000
I said it the way you talk and I got in trouble for that.

1353
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.150
Well that seems pretty fucking ridiculous.

1354
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.360
If your accent is so bad that all I have to do is imitate it and it gets a giant

1355
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:33.600
laugh in the class.

1356
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.040
You know what I did and I know what I did and the whole class knows what I did.

1357
01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:42.660
I corrected your shitty way of talking and that got me kicked out and not just

1358
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:47.310
kicked out like I'm going to say it's a fight.
I remember in work,

1359
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:47.990
but it could have,
yeah

1360
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.610
<v 2>they were.
We could,</v>

1361
01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:53.610
I know I witnessed a teacher tell a kid you're nothing and you're not going to

1362
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:58.290
amount to anything.
And it was in a moment of rage.

1363
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:01.410
Like I could see that the kid had just gotten in big trouble.

1364
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:06.390
So it was like he was flipping out.
What did the kid get in big trouble for?
He,

1365
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:08.720
we were on a um,
uh,

1366
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.760
like a school trip and he had fucked around with the air conditioning at a

1367
01:21:15.151 --> 01:21:19.830
public place.
Like,
and he,
he said it,
he said he set it at 90.

1368
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.780
So he said he'd gone but he was kind of a truck.
He was a troubled kid.

1369
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:27.750
Right.
And this teacher said that to him.
Man,

1370
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.960
I remember all of us that were in the room cause we weren't all,

1371
01:21:30.961 --> 01:21:35.550
it was only like 10 of us when this guy came in to like to yell at him.

1372
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:39.150
We were all just stared at the ground cause it was,
he was,

1373
01:21:39.151 --> 01:21:43.860
he was so full of rage when he said it to this kid.
But he really went,
I mean,

1374
01:21:43.861 --> 01:21:46.800
he went in hard.
I'm not even doing a fraction of that.
He was like,

1375
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:51.660
you're not shit and you're not going to amount to shit.
Ooh,
what the fuck?
Yeah.

1376
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:56.460
He's treating that killer grown up.
Yeah.
How old were they?
The the,
the kids.
Yeah,

1377
01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:01.280
we were,
we were,
uh,
I think juniors in high school.
So we were old enough.
Yeah.

1378
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:06.330
But like,
it's still is fucked up to say picked up.
Yeah.
Fucked up,
man.

1379
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.400
Ooh,
that's 16.
Yeah.
16 to seven.

1380
01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.900
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
you know what man,
some of those guys who just,
it's,</v>

1381
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.970
there's PTSD and being a teacher too,

1382
01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:18.990
man for stress and pressure that you have to deal with and that's fine.

1383
01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.920
Trying to raise your family and everything on that bullshit salary,

1384
01:22:22.921 --> 01:22:27.900
that bullshit salary.
Yeah.
That's why when you get a good one,
it's so memorable.

1385
01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.360
I had a really,
really good English teacher,

1386
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.520
a really good English teacher and really good Spanish teacher.

1387
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.410
The English teacher was so nice.

1388
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.860
She was so nice and everybody loved her and they got psyched when they got her.

1389
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.390
Yeah,
because she was like,

1390
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:43.470
she would talk like she was an older lady when I was in high school.

1391
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:46.050
I got to imagine she was probably in her late fifties,

1392
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.650
early sixties and uh,

1393
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.720
she would talk about sex and she would talk about like romance and a,

1394
01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:56.400
you know,
like how,
you know,

1395
01:22:56.401 --> 01:23:01.401
she was like talking about like literary works and then she would talk about how

1396
01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:04.080
it applies and like what you're going to experience in your own life.

1397
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:07.690
And it's going to be times in your own life where you just think that this is

1398
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.690
everything and this person's everything to you and they'll engine,

1399
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:12.910
those are wonderful moments.
She goes put,

1400
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:16.240
they're transient and sometimes they go way,
especially when you're young,

1401
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.020
you're young and you're having sex with each other and people and people are

1402
01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:21.930
like,
what the fuck is she saying?
Yeah,

1403
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.640
we couldn't believe that you seem you're having sex.
And she's like,

1404
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.210
and then you know that person might have sex with somebody else and you're just

1405
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:31.300
going to be devastated,
but maybe they're just going to love you more.

1406
01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:32.880
Once they do that,
you know,

1407
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.250
maybe they'll make that mistake and then they'll will just make them appreciate

1408
01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:39.040
and accept you more.
But some people can't.
They can't deal with that.

1409
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:42.340
They can't deal with that.
And I remember her saying that,
I was like,
Whoa,

1410
01:23:42.341 --> 01:23:44.170
this is deep shit.
That's pretty deep.

1411
01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:49.180
High School English class as old ladies talking about fucking people and

1412
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.073
cheating,

1413
01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:54.460
jealousy and everything and how silly it all was and how in perspective when she

1414
01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:56.770
was trying to,
you know,
give us like some,

1415
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.680
I forget what the work that she was referring to,
like what,

1416
01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:03.480
what book we're talking or would a stories we were discussing that made her,

1417
01:24:03.481 --> 01:24:05.560
I bring that up.
But I remember thinking like,
wow,

1418
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:08.890
this lady just dropped some experience knowledge.
Well,
I out,

1419
01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.930
I'll never forget her saying that like that,
you know,

1420
01:24:10.931 --> 01:24:13.330
when someone leaves you or someone cheats on you,

1421
01:24:13.331 --> 01:24:15.370
it'll feel like the most devastating thing ever.

1422
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:18.700
But they might really just feel better because of like,

1423
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:20.500
they might love you more because of that.

1424
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:22.990
It might be better for your relationship after that's over.

1425
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:26.770
She went through some shit,
man.
She must have.
She must have,

1426
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.600
but it was the way she was describing it to the class.
I had a great sign.

1427
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.420
I had a great Spanish teacher to Spanish teacher was awesome.
He's like,
yeah,

1428
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:36.880
he was like friendly and fun.

1429
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.770
But then after I graduated I found out that he was banging students.

1430
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.090
Whoa.
Yeah.
That's,
he was so friendly.
Yeah.
He Bang one of my friends.

1431
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.230
Wow.
When she was 17.
Yeah.
She started,

1432
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:54.340
he started banging her like as she was a senior in high school.
I like,

1433
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:57.540
I think he banged her a little bit as she was graduating two balls.

1434
01:24:57.550 --> 01:25:01.270
It was the American.
Yup.
Yeah.
How old was he?
He was a handsome guy.

1435
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:06.820
Um hmm.
I wish I knew.
I would have to say I shit.
You know,

1436
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:09.670
obviously I was 17 so he was an adult.

1437
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:12.280
I would say he's in his twenties maybe.
Oh,
okay.

1438
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:15.310
So that's relatively a young teacher though.
Yeah,
I'd probably like twice.
I mean,

1439
01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:19.630
graduated from college so he has to be like 20 phase,
not 54 no,

1440
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:23.440
it's probably 30 like 29 30 somewhere in that range.

1441
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:27.280
But I was surprised he was banging and 17 year olds and I was like,
oh hey buddy.

1442
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:30.820
I mean,
look in perspective,

1443
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.050
if he's 43 and the girls 30 it's nothing but,
but yeah.

1444
01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.940
And your students are different than yes.
Yes,
he did.
He last long there.

1445
01:25:39.941 --> 01:25:42.850
Do you know if he's,
I don't remember.
I don't know.
I don't,
you know,
I,

1446
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:46.450
once I was gone,
I was gone,
man.
When I was,
when I graduated from high school,

1447
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:50.170
I fucking graduated.
I mean,
I never even went back and got my diploma.

1448
01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:53.020
I didn't go to my graduation.
I didn't even want it.
I was like,

1449
01:25:53.021 --> 01:25:56.920
I don't want to have anything to do with this place.
I just wanted to be free,

1450
01:25:56.950 --> 01:26:01.480
get out of there.
I wanted to be,
I just,
I just knew whatever they were selling,

1451
01:26:01.481 --> 01:26:03.420
whatever they were pushing,
whatever,
what,

1452
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.450
whatever mold they were trying to get me to fit in.

1453
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:10.810
It was unacceptable and I had to figure out what I had to like detox from

1454
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:13.400
whatever they did to me.
And it wasn't their fault.

1455
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.290
It's like they're just teaching.
It's what every what,

1456
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:17.760
every kid experiences when they're,

1457
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.870
when they're being forced into doing something they don't want to do.

1458
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:25.730
Along with the pressure of growing up,
along with the pressure,
uh,
you know,

1459
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.080
whatever your parents are putting on you with expectations your or your family

1460
01:26:30.081 --> 01:26:32.710
might have.
And with me,
there's a lot of expectations are the key.

1461
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:35.720
The people that I knew,
like a lot of the kids that I was going to school with,

1462
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:39.020
they were all set up for college and they all have these ideas of what they were

1463
01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:42.980
going to do.
And I was lost.
I was like,
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1464
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:45.170
I was competing in martial arts tournaments,

1465
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:48.590
but I knew there was a limited amount of future with that.
I was like,

1466
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:53.060
where can I take this?
And I knew that eventually if I kept going to,

1467
01:26:53.061 --> 01:26:54.850
I was kind of get brain damage,
how's it?

1468
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.620
I'm probably already getting a little bit of it and I was like this,

1469
01:26:57.621 --> 01:27:00.740
if I keep going,
I'm going to wind up fucked in the head and I go,

1470
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:05.330
I'm going to wind up slurring my words or something.
Fuck yeah,
for sure.

1471
01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.310
Especially once I started kickboxing.
So,
but I also knew that a job,

1472
01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:14.750
like a job job,
like an office job,
fucking unacceptable man.

1473
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.730
I can't do it.
I just won't.
I don't,

1474
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:20.520
I have too much energy or I have too much impatience or something.
I mean,

1475
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:22.130
I'm not gonna be able to sit down.

1476
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:27.140
So I just had a wait until I got out of there to try to take a deep breath.

1477
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.790
I took a year off,
didn't do anything for a year,
just worked,
worked and competed.

1478
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:32.990
And,
um,

1479
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:37.990
then I started going to a Boston or a Umass Boston for a,

1480
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:40.760
just like they had like a continuing education program.

1481
01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:44.200
Like he didn't have to take your sats.
Yeah,
I never took my sats.
Yeah.

1482
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:47.330
So I just went and I did that for three years and then I was like,
what am,

1483
01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:48.530
I'm just wasting my time.

1484
01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:52.520
<v 2>Yeah.
Fucking complete waste.
I fucking,</v>

1485
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:56.750
I knew that in an office it would be,

1486
01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:01.460
I think my literal death,
I could feel the depression of it sitting in,
you know,

1487
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.580
like all it especially cause it was,
I think it's a lot of it,

1488
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:06.470
it's not that working in an office is the worst.

1489
01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.720
It's that it wasn't meaningful work.

1490
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.490
It wasn't anything that I cared about and any of the office jobs I had were just

1491
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:14.450
something to do.

1492
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.570
Cause you're supposed to have a job then what did you think you wanted to do

1493
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:20.540
when you were in high school?
Like when you're like,
you're 17,

1494
01:28:20.541 --> 01:28:23.720
you're about to graduate,
what do you want to do?
I knew I wanted to do comedy,

1495
01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.450
but ideally,
yeah.
But I didn't know I wanted to do standup.

1496
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.830
I really thought that I think is because what's accessible or what seemed

1497
01:28:30.831 --> 01:28:35.150
accessible or like the thing that I responded to was watching movies,
you know,

1498
01:28:35.151 --> 01:28:39.710
and t so I thought I would be,
uh,
a comedic actor of some kind,
you know,
like I,

1499
01:28:39.711 --> 01:28:43.850
that's what I thought.
Who was your favorite?
Um,
I love,

1500
01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.350
I mean I loved like the,
you know,
Belushi,
no Ackroyd I liked him.

1501
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:51.650
I liked Bill Murray a lot and I liked the Eddie Murphy.

1502
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:55.370
Like those were kind of like,
like my two favorites as a course,
you know,

1503
01:28:55.371 --> 01:28:59.870
so like I thought everything,
both of their schools are like,
their,

1504
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:02.070
their styles are really different.
But to me they were like

1505
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:04.050
<v 0>the really the fun Chevy Chase and stuff.</v>

1506
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:06.900
Like those guys were like the funniest fucking guys to me.

1507
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:09.900
Whatever happened to Bob and Doug,
Mackenzie,

1508
01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.450
Bob and Doug Mckenzie member,
the honey,
I shrunk the kids guy.
Oh yeah,

1509
01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.460
with the glasses.
Yeah.
And then there was the other,
they had a show.

1510
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.270
Isn't that Rick Maranas?
Yes.
He said he quit acting.
What happened with that guy?

1511
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.720
He quit acting because he just didn't want to be,
that's what I read.

1512
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.280
He didn't want to be in uh,
in the,
and they thought the business was ridiculous.

1513
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.180
He,
a lot of people that feel like that is you start at certain point,

1514
01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:36.180
we just don't want to have anything to do.
I think he like,
he moved to like,
uh,

1515
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:38.520
you know,
just off,
not off the grid really,

1516
01:29:38.521 --> 01:29:42.480
but like just away from La and just done,
done.

1517
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:45.390
Just know he does for a living.
I did too.
I wonder,
I forget,

1518
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.680
I read an article about him,

1519
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:50.760
about how he just starting and movies and it was just like,
fuck this over it.

1520
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:53.550
It's interesting that some,
some people do,

1521
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.670
they have that wake up moment or like,
okay,

1522
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:58.590
well this is not what I wanted to do.

1523
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.380
It's not what I thought it was and now that I'm doing it,

1524
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.670
I got to get out of this.
Yeah.
I mean if you're working in entertainment too,

1525
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:10.080
especially like on the,
the acting,

1526
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.900
you know,
directing side of things.
Like,
if you're like one of the,

1527
01:30:12.901 --> 01:30:17.901
I could see how there's so much nonsense involved in the business side of that,

1528
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:20.970
that it's very,
at some point I could,
you know,

1529
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:25.050
you can be very talented and not be working at it and be like,
what am I doing?

1530
01:30:25.051 --> 01:30:29.850
Just trying to get into the system,
you know?
Yeah.
Well it seems unattainable.

1531
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:34.560
Yeah.
And when things seem unattainable,
you think you want them,
right,
right,

1532
01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:36.510
right,
right.
Yeah.
You think you do.
Well,

1533
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:39.330
that's what I think happens to a lot of people when they get that reality show

1534
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:43.440
fame.
You know,
they think they look at it,
they're like,
if I was famous boy,

1535
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.290
everything could be great.
And then,
you know,

1536
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.900
you wind up being one of the housewives.

1537
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:52.050
It's like on the cover of the magazines and then you realize how many fucking

1538
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:55.230
people hate you.
Yeah.
The anger.

1539
01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:00.150
Or have you ever like seen like the TMZ comments one of those like real

1540
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:04.980
housewives gets in trouble like Jesus Christ,

1541
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:06.040
you're hated.
Yeah.

1542
01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:11.230
Monsters out there that are focusing their rage for whatever disappointment they

1543
01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:14.520
have in their life on you because you're the chick on the housewife with the

1544
01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:17.400
fake lips.
And to a certain extent too,
it just,

1545
01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:22.410
this is something more like relevant.
They became about in the last,

1546
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:26.640
I feel like 15,
20 years,
which is that,
um,

1547
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.550
being famous for the sake of being famous,
you know,
really is a curse.

1548
01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.150
You know,
it's,
it's a,
it's a highly pursued thing now where people are just like,

1549
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.220
being famous has gotta be the best thing ever.

1550
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:42.090
But when there's nothing behind the reason that you're known,

1551
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:46.730
I feel like that's just an a fucking empty black hole.
But is it a mom,

1552
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:51.800
as much of a black hole as growing up in poverty in a bad neighborhood in la?

1553
01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:55.950
Like if you look at those kids that you saw in those projects that are in this

1554
01:31:55.951 --> 01:32:00.160
trap,
yeah.
Was stuck in this awful neighborhood crime infested the community.

1555
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:05.110
<v 1>Is that a worst life or is it a war of slave to be Kim Kardashian where</v>

1556
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:07.330
everybody just shits in your mouth everywhere you go?

1557
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.980
Well they shouldn't her mouth as she gets on a Gulf stream.

1558
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:15.430
G Six 50 exactly.
No,
so it's like,
yeah.

1559
01:32:15.431 --> 01:32:19.810
It's like I understand the the face to do you think,

1560
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:23.020
do you think to her face they're mean?
I bet they're not.
No they're not.

1561
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:26.290
I bet there's a lot of apps have some mean she's had some mean things probably

1562
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:26.681
yelled at her,

1563
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:31.330
but there's no way people are as brutal as they are online as to her face.

1564
01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.090
No Way.
Yeah.
Even those people that are brutal to her online.
Yes.

1565
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.130
They met her and they were in front of her.
Yeah.
That's why the,

1566
01:32:39.131 --> 01:32:43.090
the interaction with people online is like so flawed.
Yeah.

1567
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:46.360
I was reading a mean blog about someone the other day and I was like,

1568
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:47.620
I wonder what this person,

1569
01:32:47.621 --> 01:32:50.560
how this person would feel if there were sitting down with this guy having a

1570
01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:51.550
conversation with them.

1571
01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:55.780
Like I wonder if they would write if they would say the same type of shit that

1572
01:32:55.781 --> 01:32:58.360
they wrote when the person can respond.

1573
01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:03.540
It's like the blog writing mean blog about someone is really like the coward's

1574
01:33:04.001 --> 01:33:07.420
way out.
It really is in a lot of ways because you're,

1575
01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:11.290
you're addressing someone that can address you back in some sort of as well.

1576
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:13.440
Then again,
so is shitting on them in a,

1577
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.770
in a podcast or shitting on I'm doing stand up at least.
Well that's,

1578
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.330
I was going to say at least we're trying to be entertaining,

1579
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:22.000
but I guess they're trying to be entertaining when they write a blog too.
Yeah,

1580
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:24.920
they are.
They're trying to get something out of them.
Um,

1581
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.060
we were talking before the show about that girl who made that video about fat

1582
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.870
shaming.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I only know about it because I saw a tweet,

1583
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.610
again going back to like the entertainment of it.
Like I saw a tweet,

1584
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:40.340
I saw the response video that,
uh,
Sean help and made.

1585
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:43.830
I haven't seen that.
It was pretty funny.
Man Posts.
Really funny.
Let's,

1586
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:48.110
let's play that.
First of all,
I watched part of the video this morning.
I,

1587
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.810
it should have been edited.
I got,

1588
01:33:49.811 --> 01:33:52.780
I got her point after like the first few minutes,
but I thought it was,

1589
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:57.820
it was good.
It was okay.
You know?
Yeah.
Well as she's hot,
she's hot.

1590
01:33:57.821 --> 01:33:58.750
That's part of the problem.

1591
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:02.230
She shitting on fat people and she's got a perfect body and beautiful face and

1592
01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:06.670
yeah,
big old today's.
Yeah,
but this is like,
you know,

1593
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:11.110
I guess she makes,
I dunno,
youtube videos,
but look,

1594
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:14.020
there's a fucking business and making these goddamn youtube videos.

1595
01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.540
There are the comedy store next door.

1596
01:34:16.541 --> 01:34:20.280
They have that hotel where they use the side of the hotel is a billboard and

1597
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:21.460
they paint stuff on it.

1598
01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:26.200
There's a huge one that was all just as youtube page.
So this girl that,

1599
01:34:26.201 --> 01:34:27.034
I don't know who she is,

1600
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.150
but she has 2 million followers on youtube and youtube has decided to take out

1601
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:36.250
giant billboards on the sunset strip that show people that have more than a

1602
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:39.490
million followers.
So they have like x amount of million.
Wow.
Yeah.

1603
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:43.540
And then she has more than one.
This one girl,
I don't remember her name at all,

1604
01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:46.450
but like it's her with like some cheese puffs on it.
You know,

1605
01:34:46.451 --> 01:34:49.600
it's like trying to be wacky,
but there's a,
there's several of them.

1606
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.820
I've seen several.
So there's,

1607
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.470
if you can be entertaining like this girl hit the fucking jackpot with this

1608
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:58.250
video because we're talking about

1609
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:00.860
<v 3>it,
right?
It's on Twitter.
A lot of people talking about it.</v>

1610
01:35:01.770 --> 01:35:03.770
Sean Halpern doesn't help.
And by the way,

1611
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:06.950
I'm not Sean helping if anyone's watching the way better looking at him,

1612
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.100
I don't give a fuck.
Everybody says let's,
let's play it.

1613
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.810
Let's see what their response

1614
01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:16.090
<v 1>got my Kisha here today.
You don't know if this is hairspray or semen?
No.</v>

1615
01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.990
Pretty sure that seaman,
dear fat people.
Yes.

1616
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:21.430
What do you have to tell us?

1617
01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.160
<v 5>Some people are already really mad at this video</v>

1618
01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:28.430
<v 1>cause I'm mad about your shitty act outs.
What are you gonna do?</v>

1619
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.350
I'm going to sit here and wait for you to tell me a hacky fat joke.

1620
01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.920
<v 5>What do you do?
Wait,
what are you going to chase me?
Really?
You're gonna Chase me?</v>

1621
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:36.800
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.790
<v 1>Nope.
I only chase after Taco trucks and people that are relevant.</v>

1623
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.190
<v 5>It's going to be like fucking Frankenstein.</v>

1624
01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:47.610
<v 1>Frankenstein wasn't fat.
He was slow.
Oh.
Oh,
I see what you're doing.</v>

1625
01:35:47.611 --> 01:35:51.660
You're comparing.
Someone took a comedy class.
Yeah.

1626
01:35:51.661 --> 01:35:56.661
Can you act out being a Zombie so we can get the whole side by crowd and nerds

1627
01:35:56.911 --> 01:35:57.900
behind you.

1628
01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.400
<v 5>I can get away from you by walking at a reasonable pace.</v>

1629
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.180
<v 1>Is that a snake?
Oh No,
it's just your list.</v>

1630
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:09.600
<v 5>Frankenstein not so fast.
Zombies have apparently gotten faster.</v>

1631
01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.770
<v 1>Oh,
we're talking about zombies now you're way off from your original message.</v>

1632
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.880
<v 5>I watch like three episodes of the walking dead and not being slow myself and</v>

1633
01:36:17.881 --> 01:36:18.690
the gray goods.

1634
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.130
<v 1>Yeah,
so I'm looking at</v>

1635
01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:23.010
<v 5>realize that every single episode is exactly the same.</v>

1636
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:26.680
<v 1>What you mean killing zombies?
That's what the show is about.
Dot.
Me.</v>

1637
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:31.820
<v 5>Oh No.
They need something,
but it's all the way over there.
Where the zombies?
Yes,</v>

1638
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.780
<v 1>because that's what the show is about.</v>

1639
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:39.560
And why is this being shot like an American apparel ad?
That shit

1640
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.010
shaming.
It's not a thing.

1641
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.570
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1642
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:47.000
<v 1>Why don't you tell that to the teenagers to kill theirself?</v>

1643
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:49.100
Because people were fat shaming them.

1644
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.230
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:55.030
<v 1>Oh,
you can't cause your dad.
Oh Shit.
It's probably made up.</v>

1646
01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:56.650
<v 6>Wow.</v>

1647
01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:59.110
<v 1>Why made up by the same person who told you you have talent?</v>

1648
01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.030
<v 5>That's the race card with no race.</v>

1649
01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.250
<v 1>Now you're bringing race into it.
Oh,
and can I get a shitty act out?</v>

1650
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:06.770
<v 5>Yeah,
but I couldn't fit into a store.</v>

1651
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:11.940
That's discrimination now then that means you're too fat and you should stop

1652
01:37:11.941 --> 01:37:12.420
beating it,
right?

1653
01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.380
<v 1>Hey,
can someone shut this bitch up?
Drop that shitty act out.</v>

1654
01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:21.230
<v 5>Everybody just needs to make laws.
There's a race car is a disability card.</v>

1655
01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.370
There was even a gay card

1656
01:37:22.450 --> 01:37:24.610
<v 1>race card,
a disability card.</v>

1657
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:28.260
A gay card is bitch better not have a sag card.

1658
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:32.110
<v 5>All right,
good harvest from an to guest wrongfully so</v>

1659
01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:36.180
<v 1>no,
the gate car's covered in glitter.
It's fucking magical.
Oh,</v>

1660
01:37:36.181 --> 01:37:39.990
hope you choke on a glow stick.
Hope somebody beat you with a Unicorn.

1661
01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.430
Hope somebody takes those three cards you're talking about and shoves him up.

1662
01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:47.470
<v 5>I ain't going to tell a doctor that they're being mean and fat shaming you when</v>

1663
01:37:47.471 --> 01:37:49.240
they say you have fucking heart disease.

1664
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:53.470
<v 1>No,
because he's a professional and he's saying it to my face.</v>

1665
01:37:53.471 --> 01:37:57.000
He's not on social media making dumb blanket statement.

1666
01:37:58.090 --> 01:38:00.760
<v 5>I'm not talking about people who have a little bit of cushion.</v>

1667
01:38:00.761 --> 01:38:03.370
For the pushing and if there's people watching this with a specific health

1668
01:38:03.371 --> 01:38:04.900
condition,
this is not aimed at you.

1669
01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:08.330
<v 1>You just talked about someone who might have heart disease.</v>

1670
01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:13.500
<v 5>You talking about the 35% of North Americans who are old piece spell</v>

1671
01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.580
<v 1>obese.
I dare you.</v>

1672
01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:23.490
You are affecting your
doctor,

1673
01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:28.000
but I bet you played one in a porno phone,
isn't the thing.
Never said.
Okay.
Yeah,

1674
01:38:28.001 --> 01:38:30.430
that sounds great.
Yeah.

1675
01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.130
Well that's what happens when you make something like that,
right?
Yeah.

1676
01:38:36.131 --> 01:38:39.470
If you open yourself up to that dude,
when you make anything,
no,
you're out,

1677
01:38:39.471 --> 01:38:42.070
but you're like,
you know what?
I've what?
Whoa.
Whoa.

1678
01:38:42.071 --> 01:38:45.670
Does that say Damon Wayans Defense Bill Cosby?
Yeah.
You didn't hear about that.

1679
01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:49.550
Shut the fuck.
Oh,
you should have here.
Hold on a second.
What is that?
Hold on.
Oh,

1680
01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:53.140
this is,
he was on the breakfast club the other day.
I'm on.
Just pull it.

1681
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.680
Pull that up too.
That's,
that was it.
That can't be real.

1682
01:38:56.681 --> 01:39:00.310
It was just on the headline thing.
You know they have that little headline thing.

1683
01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:04.810
Dropdown.
Yeah,
the dropdown,
I guess.
Entertainment.
Go to entertainment.
Cecil.

1684
01:39:04.811 --> 01:39:06.250
The lion killers back to it.
There it is.

1685
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:10.750
Damon Wayans defense bill Cosby after this where he calls his accusers
unrapable.

1686
01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:14.410
Oh no,
he didn't say.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1687
01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:19.870
No,
you know who else defended him?
Who Chuck d?

1688
01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:25.000
Chuck d called them the all the accusations against doctor Cosby.

1689
01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:29.020
That's what he said.
Doctor Cosby.
Which by the,
by the way,
first of all,

1690
01:39:29.021 --> 01:39:31.810
he's not a fucking doctor.
It's an honorary doctorate.

1691
01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:33.760
He can't call him doctor Cosby.

1692
01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:38.110
When a university gives you an honorary doctorate for fucking showing up and

1693
01:39:38.111 --> 01:39:41.470
being nice is,
it gives a lot of attention and promotion.
The chuck to do that.

1694
01:39:41.471 --> 01:39:44.680
Recently,
very recently.
Really?
I was shocked.

1695
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:49.450
It was talking about that the conspiracy against doctor cause him on.
No,
I'm not.

1696
01:39:49.451 --> 01:39:53.140
I'm not kidding.
And I'm a huge Chuck d fan.
Huge public enemy fan.

1697
01:39:53.141 --> 01:39:57.370
But I don't know man.
Fuck man.
Tell the truth.

1698
01:39:57.371 --> 01:40:01.090
Wayne said about his advice for the Cosby show.
Star.
If I was him,

1699
01:40:01.091 --> 01:40:02.260
I would divorce my wife,

1700
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:05.500
give her all my money and then I would go do a deposition.

1701
01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:09.970
I would light one of those three hours cigars and have some wine and maybe

1702
01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:14.410
equate list
and I would just go off,

1703
01:40:14.411 --> 01:40:16.150
cause I don't believe that he was raping.

1704
01:40:16.151 --> 01:40:19.210
I believe he was in relationships with all of them.
And then he was like,

1705
01:40:19.211 --> 01:40:22.000
you know what?
It's 78.

1706
01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:25.450
It don't work like that no more.

1707
01:40:25.451 --> 01:40:29.800
I can't get it up for any y'all by bitches.
And then they're like,
oh really?
Rape.

1708
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:35.170
It was he just trying to be funny.
It's hard.
It's hard to know.
Yeah.
Okay.

1709
01:40:35.171 --> 01:40:39.710
Power one oh five,
his breakfast club.
Is that,
that Dude Charlemagne?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1710
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.650
That guy is like,
his whole show is like talking shit and I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,

1711
01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:47.880
fine.
The God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So he's just trying to probably be,
wait,
good.

1712
01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:51.120
He called it the money hustle.
I think he should listen to this.
I,

1713
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:54.190
this is one of those things where I definitely don't,
there should have audio

1714
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:54.900
<v 3>of it.</v>

1715
01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.650
Let's play the audio because I don't think like I'm doing it a shitty version of

1716
01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:01.960
it cause uh,

1717
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:09.010
it's just like,
I don't think that he,
um,
you know,

1718
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:12.490
I can't,
I have a really hard time believing that you actually said that.

1719
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.300
That's fucking crazy
is fine.

1720
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:20.620
The actual a thing of it and then we'll uh,
we'll go back to it.

1721
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:23.830
Do you have the ability to only have the audio in your head so you can listen to

1722
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:27.330
it?
Know what the fuck kind of a studio that we have here,
Jamie,
we need to do,

1723
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:32.140
if you put,
if you type in breakfast club,
will it?
Well,
I think he found it.

1724
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.510
He just has to
isolate the audio.
That's crazy.

1725
01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:42.511
Like I said that though she's dead is career suicide because then he also,

1726
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:46.870
he also was like,
yeah,
I'll just let you play.
It was,
it was pretty crazy.

1727
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:50.590
Did you hear it?
I read it.
I read a full like transcript.
I didn't hear it.

1728
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.410
It's hard because Damon is really funny.

1729
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:56.470
Damon Wayans is one of the most underrated comedians,

1730
01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.770
like almost ever Damon Waynes at one point in time.

1731
01:42:00.130 --> 01:42:03.700
I know he got off of it and decided to like do more acting.

1732
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:05.110
He was in the last boy scout.

1733
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:10.060
He had made some like really big movies and he was doing real well and it was

1734
01:42:10.061 --> 01:42:12.700
coming off of in living color and he was on his way to,

1735
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:16.930
he was on his way to superstar them to the point where he did um,
one,

1736
01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:21.010
one of his HBO specials,
I think it was called Damon Waynes last stand.

1737
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.490
And when it was over he threw the mic down and say like,

1738
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.580
this is my last stand up.

1739
01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:27.100
I'm ever going to do a little maybe through the mic down and walked away.

1740
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:30.970
And I remember thinking like,
you can't stop.
Like you're so good.

1741
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.390
He's one of my favorites at the time he was like one of my all time favorites

1742
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:38.080
and I just,
you don't hear him doing standup that much anymore?

1743
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:41.600
You don't hear of it.
I did a show though.
Um,

1744
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:46.420
it was like probably nine months ago at flappers and then they're like,

1745
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:48.820
hey,
uh,
cause it wasn't like my show that,

1746
01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:53.320
do you mind if Damon Waynes does a spot next?
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
And I go,

1747
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:58.300
no.
And he came in and just did a spot before,
you know right after me.
Oh yeah,

1748
01:42:58.301 --> 01:43:02.380
it's fun.
Yeah.
But before you,
that guy does long sets.
Like he used to,

1749
01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:06.130
he used to show up at the comedy store and like at the height of his fame he

1750
01:43:06.131 --> 01:43:09.270
would go up and do like 45 minutes out of nowhere he was doing like,
um,

1751
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:12.110
he was really doing a workout set,
like a real workout set.

1752
01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.210
And it was really funny.
Like it wasn't like fully polished bits yet,

1753
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:19.870
but it was a really funny,
no,
he fucks around a lot.
He takes a lot of chances.

1754
01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:22.060
Yeah.
He's funny man.
He,

1755
01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.070
I used to see him a lot when I was coming up at the comedy store in the 90s.

1756
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.850
And a,
he would come by and do those long sets.
And this was like,
like I said,

1757
01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:34.220
at the height of his stardom.
But I think the Sitcom world lured,

1758
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:37.450
lured him away man.
Cause that was crazy money cause that he had that.

1759
01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.450
What was that last time that he did that ran for like a while?

1760
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:43.750
It ran for a wildlife and kids or something that that ran for a while,

1761
01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.940
but nobody gave a fuck about it.
No,

1762
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:48.400
I mean I'm sure the people watching it might've given a fuck about it,

1763
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:52.000
but in comparison to like what he's capable of with a standard.
Yeah.
No

1764
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.470
<v 0>cause a monster.
He's a monster.
He could have been,</v>

1765
01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.290
I think one of the all time greats.
I really do believe that.

1766
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.930
I really do believe that.
I think he could been like Chapelle.

1767
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.990
I think it could have been right up there with all those guys who were as strong

1768
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.030
when you're,
imagine what his quote was.

1769
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:10.250
I just going into that stupid stupid money.
Yeah.
And you know it's fucking hard,

1770
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:13.820
man.
Did they get lured into that?
Or Boy,
who knows?
Man.

1771
01:44:13.821 --> 01:44:15.980
Maybe he just decided that that's what he wanted to do.

1772
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:19.790
Maybe the idea of doing standup all the time wasn't appealing.
Tim.

1773
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.800
I don't know man.
You know?
Yeah.
But it's just,
I see a guy like that and I go,
wow,

1774
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:28.880
that's kind of crazy cause he's like easily one of the all times

1775
01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.090
during the day,
during the day,

1776
01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.650
back in the day and then you see them now and just never hear about them
anymore.

1777
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.890
I never hear about him like doing like a stadium somewhere or they they said,

1778
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.410
I mean I don't know if this was true,
but I remember hearing multiple,

1779
01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:49.411
we'll talk say that Eddie Murphy when he stopped doing standup was saying that

1780
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:52.790
like I don't want to even have to compete with Daymond weights.

1781
01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.610
Like I heard people say that,

1782
01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:57.860
that that's what Eddie Murphy thought of Damon Wayans that he was like that's,

1783
01:44:57.861 --> 01:45:00.200
it was the funniest fucking guy.
He was so good dude.

1784
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.140
I remember seeing him nights at the comedy store with like 50 people in the

1785
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:07.970
audience just rushing.
Yeah.
And be inspired thinking,

1786
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:11.150
fuck this one of those good,
natural,
like it's overused term,

1787
01:45:11.151 --> 01:45:13.370
but he's just naturally funny guy.
Right?
Like he's a guy.

1788
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:17.720
I feel like that could just kind of talk about anything.
It'd be funny.

1789
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:19.280
Well he works at it for sure.

1790
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.490
I mean it's hard to say naturally funny when the guy's doing sets all the time.

1791
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.150
True.
You know,
we all know that that's the way it,
everything is polished up.

1792
01:45:26.151 --> 01:45:28.790
But yeah,
I had heard that.
I don't know if that's true,

1793
01:45:28.791 --> 01:45:29.810
so I probably shouldn't be saying it,

1794
01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:34.160
but I had heard that he had installed a stage in his house.
Come on.
Yeah.

1795
01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:38.660
That he put a stage like he installed like a little mini comedy club in his

1796
01:45:38.661 --> 01:45:43.500
house.
I like to fuck around and practice.
Really?
Yeah.
That sounds crazy.
It,

1797
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:46.310
it does sound crazy,
but why is that crazy?

1798
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:50.120
But someone installing a music studio in their house isn't crazy.
It's true.

1799
01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:50.540
I get,

1800
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:55.540
because I think it's the idea that you need like pretty much strangers to be at

1801
01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:58.730
your comedy show.
You know,
like you need an audience or a studio.

1802
01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.010
It's where you do your work.
Doesn't matter where it's located.

1803
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.700
Like are you just going to have people like Rsvp to my house this weekend,
man?

1804
01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:09.380
Well maybe he would practice in front of nobody and maybe he would have his

1805
01:46:09.381 --> 01:46:12.850
family sit down.
Listen,
Oh,
who the fuck knows?
Yeah,

1806
01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.410
at privacy front and nobody's kind of a weird thing,
right?

1807
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:19.520
Like I've heard people tell me a lot of times I've heard people go,
hey man,

1808
01:46:19.521 --> 01:46:21.860
I'm trying to get into stand up.
Like what should I do?
And I'm like,

1809
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.950
well you know,
get on stage.
Like I do it a lot.
I'm like,
where do you do it?

1810
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.330
Like at home,
stay standing in front of the mirror and do it there.
I'm like,

1811
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:32.090
Oh yeah,
you need it when you need an audience.
Man.

1812
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:37.330
I recorded all my ideas like as standup bits before I ever did them.

1813
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:42.020
It had like a tape recorder when those little press buttons and your record.

1814
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.150
But it was,
you know,
when I was,
I never even did stand up yet.

1815
01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:50.250
So it was my idea of what standup should

1816
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:54.540
<v 3>sound like the mind.
Where are those tapes?</v>

1817
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:59.700
I'd love to get ahold of that.
Or is everybody doing?
How's everybody?

1818
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:05.580
Oh,
it was awful.
I'm sure.

1819
01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:08.520
But I only did it like before.
I did stand out.

1820
01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:11.730
Once I got did my first open mic night,
I stopped doing it.

1821
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.270
Do you record ideas still in New York?
Like your phone's yes,
I'll record ideas,

1822
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.840
but more often than that instead of recording,
um,
I do record them,

1823
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:23.670
but I talk into the voice thing.
I talking to,

1824
01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:28.020
uh,
this,
you know,
you have the voice,
the voice notes or the,
um,
the notes APP.

1825
01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:30.960
You know,
you could talk to it.
No.
Oh Dude.
Check this out.
She,

1826
01:47:30.961 --> 01:47:34.740
this little button right here.
Yeah.
Thomson Gora is a bad motherfucker.

1827
01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:41.260
Bam.
Oh,
that's a notes.
Yup.
How the fuck am I haven't ever dumb it.
Oh,

1828
01:47:41.261 --> 01:47:45.130
it's amazing.
So I'm in my car.
If I'm in my car and I have an idea,

1829
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:47.250
I'll either record it well,

1830
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:52.350
which I'll sometimes do or I will just say the note and it will type it out for

1831
01:47:52.721 --> 01:47:54.370
you.
But there's some,

1832
01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:59.280
there's some stuff that's lost and like writing things down as opposed to like

1833
01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:04.390
hearing it.
So did you isolate what he said?
Okay.

1834
01:48:04.570 --> 01:48:08.940
Joe Rogan just taught me how this shit works.
Oh Man.

1835
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:10.830
And then amazing.
It's so accurate now.

1836
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:14.870
<v 8>Yeah,
it would.
Yeah.</v>

1837
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:17.760
What advice would you give bill Cosby now if you could tell him this is what you

1838
01:48:17.761 --> 01:48:18.594
need to do.

1839
01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:22.430
<v 3>He say die.
Die.</v>

1840
01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.120
<v 9>I,
if I was him,</v>

1841
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.680
I would divorce my wife,
wink,
wink,

1842
01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:34.600
give all my money and then I would go do a deposition at light,

1843
01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:36.430
one of them three hours cigars.

1844
01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.880
I have me some why and maybe a quail Lu and I would just go off because I don't

1845
01:48:42.881 --> 01:48:46.930
believe that he was raping.
I think he was in relationships with all of them.

1846
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:50.320
And then he's like,
you know what?
It's 70 80 don't work no more.

1847
01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:55.480
I can't get it up for any of y'all buy bitches.
And how they'd like,

1848
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:56.380
Oh really?
Rape.

1849
01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.720
Because I mean the 40 year relationships with 40 years,

1850
01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:02.800
you listen,

1851
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:07.780
how big is his penis that it give you Amnesia for 40 years?

1852
01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.770
<v 8>Whoa.
No.
And often is some women did come out previously,</v>

1853
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:13.180
Dan,

1854
01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:17.290
go ahead previously and come out and give their stories and we didn't hear is a

1855
01:49:17.291 --> 01:49:21.940
couple of them,
right?
That did,
you know,
decades.
A couple of decades ago.
So yeah,

1856
01:49:21.941 --> 01:49:25.020
but he never was charged with anything.
Right.
But if you listen to them talk,

1857
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:26.030
they go,
well,
the

1858
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:29.680
<v 9>first time,
the first time bitch,
how many times did it happen?</v>

1859
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:33.190
This listen to what they're saying.
And some of them really,

1860
01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.500
it's unreasonable when you look,
look at them and go,

1861
01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.920
<v 3>no,
wait,
not one debt,
Yay.
And Charlemagne,</v>

1862
01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.233
yeah,
to here.

1863
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:48.470
<v 8>No,
but I am.
Then the dynamics that might've been hot,</v>

1864
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.710
but I understand the dynamic of people saying,
well why were you alone with him?

1865
01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.250
Or why were you in that room?
Or why did you go upstairs with him?

1866
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:04.120
And then people,
people look at you in a certain way and you're like,
man,

1867
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:06.100
maybe I shouldn't have done that.
Maybe that's my fault.

1868
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:10.050
<v 9>Look,
I understand fame.
I've lived it.</v>

1869
01:50:10.710 --> 01:50:14.490
Women will throw themselves at you.
They want,
you know,

1870
01:50:14.491 --> 01:50:16.410
they just want to be in New York presence.

1871
01:50:16.411 --> 01:50:21.390
This some that innocently will come up.
They're putting out 40 something women.

1872
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.100
They're not that naive.

1873
01:50:23.101 --> 01:50:28.101
He talked about in 1965 he just walked in someone's dressing room in and put his

1874
01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.330
penis in your mouth.

1875
01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:33.660
But then people who are also looking at bill Cosby and the persona that he has,

1876
01:50:33.661 --> 01:50:36.090
if like a mentor,
I'm going to help you with your career.

1877
01:50:36.091 --> 01:50:40.040
And some of them were on the Cosby show and we come into his dressing room cause

1878
01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:43.510
we did wrong.
He start criticizing young black men.
Yup.

1879
01:50:43.890 --> 01:50:47.370
And then he lost us.
Yup.

1880
01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:51.780
And so we're not supporting him and they see that opening and so now you know

1881
01:50:51.781 --> 01:50:56.290
what attack him,
kill him.
But the dude from seventh heaven,
his shows still on TV.

1882
01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:59.560
Yup.
That's very true.
What you said because Woody Allen making sure,

1883
01:50:59.670 --> 01:51:02.400
<v 1>oh is that dude from seventh heaven?
So show still on TV.</v>

1884
01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.420
I thought they pulled that.

1885
01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:07.080
I don't know if it was pause that real quick then I would,
is that,

1886
01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:11.370
I think it's cool they got pulled a while ago.
I thought,
yeah.
Is that true?

1887
01:51:11.970 --> 01:51:16.260
One that actually I remember when that was 77 guy,
he calms.
Right.

1888
01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:20.520
He actually admitted that he raped young girls.
Right.

1889
01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:24.960
He admitted that he had sexually molested young girls.
Yeah.
Oh,
let's see.

1890
01:51:24.961 --> 01:51:29.490
Seventh Heaven canceled.
Well,
they stopped.

1891
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:32.760
I thought they even stopped airing the reruns.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1892
01:51:32.761 --> 01:51:36.690
I'm pretty sure seventh heaven was canceled.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1893
01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:41.420
That's canceled.
Yeah.
But that guy is not in jail.
Right.

1894
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:45.590
Don't know.
I don't know.
Stephen Collins is his name.
Let's see.

1895
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:51.510
Steve Collins.
But I think,
uh,

1896
01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.210
yeah,
confesses sexual abuse,
but that's December.
Yeah.

1897
01:51:56.211 --> 01:52:00.620
The last news of this was from over a year ago.

1898
01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:06.320
Wow.
So it just,
that's it.
He got divorced.
He's divorced.
This is the last,

1899
01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:11.210
um,
piece of news is that he got divorced,
is divorced,
settled,

1900
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:15.200
and then his confession tape.
Wasn't that a part of the divorce?

1901
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.790
Like the part of like why he got caught was that his wife,

1902
01:52:20.410 --> 01:52:24.410
he recorded it.
I recorded it and she outdid him because she was divorcing him.

1903
01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.250
Well,
who knows why she didn't,
I hope she,
you know,

1904
01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.120
I hope she felt like he was a piece of shit and I was part of the reasons

1905
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:34.580
Washington it sediment,

1906
01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:39.581
a 50 50 split as we previous reported the pot is worth around 14 million bucks.

1907
01:52:40.801 --> 01:52:45.080
I,
I had 14 million bucks.
What the hell man?
Imagine.

1908
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.100
Imagine the poor

1909
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.700
<v 0>woman live homeless guy and he's fucking little kids kids.</v>

1910
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:55.850
God dammit.
Yeah.
That guy should be,

1911
01:52:56.490 --> 01:53:01.490
it says the tape has made him unemployable and therefore he should be socked

1912
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:05.230
with a big spousal support tab.
Oh goodness.

1913
01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:09.650
But they worked it out down to who got the front of drawing or the guy should be

1914
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:13.040
in jail period.
Right.
Just in jail.

1915
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:17.690
But this Cosby thing like Damon Wayans attitude about it is very strange.

1916
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.320
I don't agree with them at all.
No,

1917
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:25.330
I mean the heat by what he said also what he said about Cosby criticizing young

1918
01:53:26.151 --> 01:53:28.190
black men.
That's fucking absolutely the truth.

1919
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.380
He should have shut his fucking mouth about that.

1920
01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.080
But he should have shut his fucking mouth about that.

1921
01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:37.070
Not because he was raping women just because it's none of your fucking business.

1922
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:41.570
Like who who swears or who doesn't swear you're denying the artistic integrity

1923
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:45.710
of like Richard Pryor or Dave Chappelle or any of these guys who swear.

1924
01:53:45.710 --> 01:53:47.890
I think he's also making a commentary about that.

1925
01:53:47.891 --> 01:53:52.891
Cosby was doing it to young black men in society because that was a big thing

1926
01:53:54.531 --> 01:53:57.400
for him in like the last,
the last 1520 year,

1927
01:53:57.401 --> 01:54:00.620
he even wrote a book with another guy,
but he was like,

1928
01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:02.480
you know that famous like pull your pants,

1929
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:04.940
put something to you have these ridiculous names.

1930
01:54:04.941 --> 01:54:07.610
He gave like that kind of town hall speech and he went into like really

1931
01:54:07.611 --> 01:54:10.580
impoverished areas and he's like,
these names that you guys are,

1932
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.110
these aren't real names like right pooky.
Yeah,
like what's his Kwan Tasha.

1933
01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:19.100
Oh,
so when he started to do that,
people were like,
well,
here's a,

1934
01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:24.380
a Uber rich dude coming in telling us how to live our life.

1935
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:28.070
Right.
Telling us we're doing everything wrong.
He lost a lot of fans with that.

1936
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:32.150
I don't,
I think he's definitely got a point with that.
But then when he,

1937
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.460
the other thing,
the woman had a point about how Cosby had that mentor role.
Yeah,

1938
01:54:37.461 --> 01:54:40.400
exactly.
Yeah.
He would,
uh,
he would have these people and say,

1939
01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:42.320
who's going to help their career?
That's what they all said.

1940
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:45.470
Could you imagine though,
if you were a young girl,

1941
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:50.500
like some 18 year old girl and Bill Cosby who is,

1942
01:54:50.751 --> 01:54:53.200
you know,
50 or 60 at the time,
whatever the hell he was,

1943
01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:54.520
it brings you into his dressing room,

1944
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:58.520
says it's going to help your career and then slips a fucking quail food into

1945
01:54:58.521 --> 01:55:02.270
your drink and you're passed out and you wake up with your panties off and

1946
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.770
Cosby's just dripping down your asshole.
And you're like,
what dude?
Yeah.

1947
01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:10.070
You'd be so confused and so horrifying and you know,

1948
01:55:10.071 --> 01:55:12.560
no one's going to believe you too.
That's,
that's by the way,

1949
01:55:12.561 --> 01:55:16.760
the whole thing about,
like,
I've heard a lot of people bring up the,
uh,
the,

1950
01:55:16.761 --> 01:55:19.550
the time between something happening in the accusation,

1951
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:25.330
very common with sexual assault to wait long periods of time because people feel

1952
01:55:25.881 --> 01:55:29.180
shame and they feel like no one will believe them.
They don't know what to do.

1953
01:55:29.181 --> 01:55:33.360
It's really common.
It's not unusual at all.
When that's the case with,
uh,

1954
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:37.670
all rape.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
Like all the sexual sex crimes,

1955
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:40.220
a lot of times don't go reported.
Yeah.

1956
01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:43.560
It's the,
the idea that

1957
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.520
<v 8>they're Annrai bubble that he's trying to be funny.
Yeah.</v>

1958
01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:50.340
He was trying to be fine there.
Yeah.
We see that.
It was only like,

1959
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:51.660
do you want to keep going?
Sure.

1960
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:55.020
<v 9>Okay.
The guilt bill got,
but at,</v>

1961
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:59.790
but being just sit back looking at it,
I just go,
I just don't believe this.

1962
01:55:59.910 --> 01:56:00.850
I think it's a money house.

1963
01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.890
What'd you say is true social media where the loudest on social media and social

1964
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:09.240
media is what really reignited?
Definitely back a vandal blueberries.

1965
01:56:10.570 --> 01:56:13.710
Yup.
I wonder how he feels being the dude that destroyed Bill Cup.

1966
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:15.180
He should be [inaudible] bill got to be done.

1967
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:16.880
He should be charged with assessory the murder

1968
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:18.263
<v 8>shut up,
man.</v>

1969
01:56:26.590 --> 01:56:29.270
And for them to make those ideas.
That's something that was kind of like,

1970
01:56:29.271 --> 01:56:32.060
well known.
You know,
people heard that about bill Cosby.

1971
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:33.560
I remember when I was really young.

1972
01:56:33.561 --> 01:56:38.561
My Mom told me that she knew somebody that a bill Cosby had drugged and she told

1973
01:56:38.571 --> 01:56:40.820
me that when she got that back up too.

1974
01:56:40.821 --> 01:56:44.210
But it is a story that had always floated around.
That's what I think.

1975
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:48.170
But here's the thing,
I don't know.
I believe every single fifth of the 50 women,

1976
01:56:48.171 --> 01:56:49.250
but I do believe that

1977
01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.150
<v 9>there is some,
there may be an end for them.
My heart goes out to them.</v>

1978
01:56:53.450 --> 01:56:57.710
Anybody who was sure and I hope you get justice.

1979
01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.960
You are the bitches.
Look,
he gave me two pills.

1980
01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:06.170
Ain't nobody,
he's,
he wasn't a doctor back then.

1981
01:57:08.690 --> 01:57:12.740
It was like that was the drug of choice.
Like Molly's his drug of choice now.

1982
01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.210
You know like people do that to get in the mood,

1983
01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.150
you know,
I just,
I don't,
I can't grow Nando nobody never told him.

1984
01:57:23.151 --> 01:57:27.620
Yes you got him drunk.
They woke up.
But what's the joy of sleeping,

1985
01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.880
you know,
banging somebody who's asleep.
Got It.

1986
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:36.310
<v 8>Well,
and you know,
people,
people have done that to date thing.
You know</v>

1987
01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:42.400
what,
what do you think about Hannibal Birth?
I wouldn't

1988
01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.900
<v 9>want to be him.
I know because you know,
he,
the thing is he,</v>

1989
01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.950
you know,
I watch his show and I don't think he,
um,

1990
01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:57.250
it's premature in terms of his success right now.

1991
01:57:57.251 --> 01:58:01.660
They've putting him out there because you know of the guy who had to move out of

1992
01:58:01.661 --> 01:58:05.000
the bill Cosby and he wouldn't primetime [inaudible] you know,
me.

1993
01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:08.560
So hopefully maybe he'll get it,
you know,
he'll,
he'll catch it,

1994
01:58:08.561 --> 01:58:11.140
but I don't feel it right now and I,
you know,

1995
01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:14.560
I wouldn't want to be someone to take down my hero.
Right.

1996
01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.620
I think we need heroes and I think that we need to be more supportive until we

1997
01:58:19.991 --> 01:58:24.520
know for sure.
For sure.
Because ain't no charges against him.
You know,

1998
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:29.410
innocent till proven guilty.
Not In this day and age with social media,

1999
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:32.870
guilty.
You guilty ones what it says.
Right.

2000
01:58:33.490 --> 01:58:37.230
And they don't ever date,
they never retract what they say.
No,

2001
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:42.000
they just put that on you.
You know,
that's a,
that's a heavy one to carry around.
I

2002
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.420
<v 8>think the bigger thing here,
never this,
looking at anything,</v>

2003
01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:49.860
anything could happen.
And when it could be like,
oh I told him no,

2004
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:50.990
I keep my draws on.

2005
01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:55.410
They never had a baby pinned on you.

2006
01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:06.130
Really up to rape women is bill Cosby's.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2007
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:09.810
<v 1>The thing that people,</v>

2008
01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:14.840
I think they struggle with too with this whole cost we story is that like when

2009
01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:19.650
he said hero he was a hero to so many people.
That's,
that's the part that they,

2010
01:59:20.610 --> 01:59:21.900
cause they can't wrap their head around.

2011
01:59:21.901 --> 01:59:23.880
This was like if you're here as a piece of shit though,

2012
01:59:23.881 --> 01:59:26.070
don't you want a new hero?
Yeah.
But I think it's,

2013
01:59:26.071 --> 01:59:30.690
it's so beat in like the hero thing is so deep in their mind they don't want to

2014
01:59:30.691 --> 01:59:32.490
believe that the heroes a piece of shit.

2015
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:37.380
There's a problem also that there's people that are really bad people that do

2016
01:59:37.381 --> 01:59:39.980
really good things as well.
Oh right.
There's,

2017
01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:43.890
there's people that are inconsistent.
I mean they do great things.

2018
01:59:43.891 --> 01:59:47.580
Like you might be a great comic but also be a rapist.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2019
01:59:47.581 --> 01:59:50.880
It might be really drugging women and raping them as well as being really funny.

2020
01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.380
That might be his demon.
Cause like almost every comic has some sort of a demon,

2021
01:59:55.710 --> 02:00:00.600
whether it's an anger demon or a drug demon or a violence demon or a gambling

2022
02:00:00.601 --> 02:00:05.010
demon or a,
you know,
whatever the fuck the demon is.
His demon might very well be.

2023
02:00:05.011 --> 02:00:08.640
He likes to drunk people.
He likes to have that ultimate power.

2024
02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:10.590
And you know,
there's other,

2025
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:15.390
the other knock on bill Cosby has always been that he's a massive elitist where

2026
02:00:15.391 --> 02:00:17.600
he believes he's much better than everybody else.
Right.

2027
02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:18.960
It's always been the knock on him.

2028
02:00:19.770 --> 02:00:24.510
And to the point where I worked at a casino where he wanted people to tuck him

2029
02:00:24.511 --> 02:00:25.980
in bed at night,

2030
02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:30.390
he wanted the security guard to tuck him in bed.

2031
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:35.370
Like literally.
Really?
Yup.
Yup.
He likes to be tucked in bed.

2032
02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:38.820
He wanted people to sit down and watch him.

2033
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:42.810
They wanted all the staff that was working in the theater to watch him eat
curry.

2034
02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:46.650
Like this is not something that I,
I'm the only one who's heard this too.

2035
02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.560
I've read this online too that he would,

2036
02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.240
he likes the people that work there to sit down with him while he eats and they

2037
02:00:54.241 --> 02:00:57.270
don't talk to them.
The venue where they told you that?
Yes,

2038
02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:58.710
that he sits down there,

2039
02:00:58.711 --> 02:01:02.970
he needs and they all sit around and watch me and he wants them to do that.

2040
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:06.690
Like he hit a god complex,
whatever it is,

2041
02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:11.850
whatever craziness that allowed him to be that guy that openly criticized

2042
02:01:11.851 --> 02:01:14.760
people.
You ever see that Taiwan,
Wanda Sykes interviewed him some,

2043
02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:18.060
some award show or something like that and he just,
he's like,
yeah,

2044
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:20.090
get on her English.
He,

2045
02:01:20.091 --> 02:01:24.900
while he's wearing sunglasses indoors and he had that arrogance about him.

2046
02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.420
Right.
That's the same kind of arrogance.

2047
02:01:27.421 --> 02:01:30.000
It would make you feel like you're better than other people to the point where

2048
02:01:30.001 --> 02:01:32.070
you could just drug them.
You know,

2049
02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:36.780
especially some young girl that you might think it's stupid and you get his drug

2050
02:01:36.781 --> 02:01:40.010
or like this is silly bitch back at my place,
thinks

2051
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.880
<v 0>she's not going to give that pussy to bill Cosby.
Plink plink here,
drink.</v>

2052
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:48.770
This was like a Cappuccino.
Yeah.
Keep you awake.
I mean how ironic.

2053
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:51.500
It's given him Cappuccino with fucking Queloz ludes in it.

2054
02:01:51.610 --> 02:01:55.830
Here's a Sam and then that.
I keep hearing people,
they keep saying,
um,

2055
02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:00.080
what's like,
what fun is it to fuck somebody that's asleep?

2056
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.540
It's because that's what he likes.

2057
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.320
He likes raping people that are asleep.

2058
02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:08.870
It's not about hooking up because you're famous.

2059
02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:12.320
That's a crazy thing to say because what fun is it to rape someone who's

2060
02:02:12.321 --> 02:02:15.950
resisting?
We're saying that that doesn't happen every.
Of course,
of course.

2061
02:02:16.050 --> 02:02:19.660
I'm saying what Cosby likes is he likes raping passed out people.
Right.

2062
02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:22.960
What I'm saying is and how ridiculous is the,
anyone's sang that.
Right?
Right,

2063
02:02:22.961 --> 02:02:27.170
right.
That's so short sighted.
I know.
It is.
What fun is it Robin People?
Yeah.

2064
02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.330
Don't you want to get your own money?
Yeah,
of course.

2065
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:31.940
Done the same thing is it is.
It's the same.
It's just,

2066
02:02:32.770 --> 02:02:35.060
it's such a short sighted thing to say.
It's,

2067
02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:37.910
it's a type of thing that someone says when they're not talking to really

2068
02:02:37.911 --> 02:02:40.660
intelligent,
objective people on a regular basis.
Right.

2069
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:45.530
Formulating these opinions based on real extensive thinking,

2070
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.461
you know,

2071
02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:51.410
and the idea that all of them are alliance seems kind of crazy.
Yeah.

2072
02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:55.970
It just seems kind of course it's crazy.
Fucking crime.
I mean this isn't like,

2073
02:02:56.330 --> 02:03:01.040
this isn't something small.
This isn't like a guy who,
uh,
you know,

2074
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:02.930
Bill Cosby stared at my wife's tits.

2075
02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:06.050
He's checking my wife's tits to now this is like some deep,
deep,

2076
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.060
dark demonic shit.

2077
02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:11.150
And then they're going to blame like the have the blame beyond Hannibal.

2078
02:03:11.151 --> 02:03:13.490
Like it's like he did so stupid.

2079
02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.030
Also them saying that Hannibal got that show just because that handle was a hot

2080
02:03:17.031 --> 02:03:18.590
already hot,
which is why,

2081
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:22.460
which is why people were coming to see his show in a theater.
A theater show.

2082
02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.420
Yeah.
While he was talking about bill Cosby course.
So this is not a small thing.

2083
02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:28.220
And Hannibal's argument was about,

2084
02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.480
Bill Cosby always shits on people for using bad language,
which is fucking true.

2085
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:32.800
It was,

2086
02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.050
was the whole thing we were talking about like how he was lecturing exact black

2087
02:03:36.051 --> 02:03:37.980
Pete.
Exactly.
And Hannah was like,
well Lewis,

2088
02:03:37.981 --> 02:03:40.400
I'm a fucking rapist and put that fucking phone down,
Tommy.

2089
02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:44.070
Flip it over and I see what you're doing.
I see what you can get out.

2090
02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.990
I shut my phone.
I shut my computer for you.
Thank you.
I just don't want to,

2091
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:51.560
I don't want to influence you in any way.
Thank you.
It's,
it's hard,
right?

2092
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:56.570
It's kind of hard.
I think that the guy is a sick fuck.
That's what I think.

2093
02:03:56.571 --> 02:04:01.130
I think undeniably he's a sick fuck.
How sick of a fuck he is,

2094
02:04:01.330 --> 02:04:02.540
how evil he is.

2095
02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.530
The only people that know are him and the people that he did that too.

2096
02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:11.780
It's the best profile ever for somebody that wants to do that.
So the,

2097
02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:12.460
the,
if you,

2098
02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:17.460
if you take away what you know of him as a performer and the celebrity and

2099
02:04:17.751 --> 02:04:18.111
you're just,

2100
02:04:18.111 --> 02:04:23.111
imagine somebody that wants to do that and then they build a reputation of being

2101
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:27.260
someone you can trust.
Impeccable,
impeccable.
I mean,

2102
02:04:27.261 --> 02:04:31.310
he had the best reputation ever.
You know,
it's,
it's like when you,

2103
02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:34.190
like when you have,
uh,
the,
the Sandusky Guy,

2104
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:38.550
the coach that had a charity that was for kids

2105
02:04:38.630 --> 02:04:41.900
<v 1>and then,
and he was like,
I'm taking care of these kids that are,
um,
you know,</v>

2106
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:45.120
left behind and um,
and then he was raping those kids.

2107
02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:49.080
But people that were people that even knew him that were on the board of that,

2108
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:49.351
we're like,

2109
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:54.351
he's the best guy is apparently very common that one of the things that evil

2110
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:59.310
people will do is they'll start a charity and then like really harp on that

2111
02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:02.220
charity.
Let's talk about that charity all the time.

2112
02:05:02.850 --> 02:05:05.070
And they become a,

2113
02:05:05.071 --> 02:05:09.750
almost a beyond reproach because the fact they're doing such good work,
right?

2114
02:05:10.050 --> 02:05:12.840
Like one of the things Lance Armstrong used to always bring up is how much money

2115
02:05:12.841 --> 02:05:16.190
he was generating for cancer research.
Of course,
we're,
we're trying to,
we're,

2116
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:20.400
we're,
we've generated all this money for,
instead of saying action,

2117
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:24.540
except instead of saying like,
Hey,
uh,
no,
I didn't,

2118
02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:28.500
I'm not doing any steroids.
No one's doing steroids,
which he did say a few times.

2119
02:05:28.501 --> 02:05:32.790
Yeah.
Or he would like immediately go to that thing about like,

2120
02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:35.580
like how much money we're making with live strong.

2121
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:38.110
And it was people's defense for him all the time.
Yeah.
I,

2122
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.880
when I criticized him on this show,
I got lit up by people.

2123
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:44.690
This was before he can and they were like,
has he ever failed a test?

2124
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.290
Like his whole thing.
I've never failed a test.

2125
02:05:46.291 --> 02:05:49.800
And do you realize the amount of money being funneled into cancer research?

2126
02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:53.100
It's like that excuses.
It's as is all fucked up.

2127
02:05:53.250 --> 02:05:57.540
I had Jeff Novitsky on the guy who busted him and uh,
um,

2128
02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.880
after he was on,
uh,

2129
02:05:59.910 --> 02:06:04.720
lance contacted me and had a conversation with him on the phone and uh,

2130
02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:07.770
Lance Armstrong contacted and he may or may not do the podcast because he wants

2131
02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:12.420
to tell his story.
I think if I look at his point of view,

2132
02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:17.450
I think he was in a sport where everybody was doing drugs.

2133
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:23.520
Right.
And I think there's a moment when you have these ideals,

2134
02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:26.760
like what you're trying to do as a competitor and then you get to the big

2135
02:06:26.761 --> 02:06:30.600
leagues and you realize like you get into that NFL locker room when you find out

2136
02:06:30.601 --> 02:06:35.310
why people are 350 pounds of solid muscle.
Yeah.
You're like,
oh,
I get it.

2137
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.460
Like I have a buddy who played,
I don't know what to say,

2138
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:42.330
what college you played for,
but he played college for um,
he played football.

2139
02:06:42.331 --> 02:06:43.380
He's a big fucking dude.

2140
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:47.250
And he played with a bunch of guys who were in the NFL now he had some injuries

2141
02:06:47.251 --> 02:06:51.750
and he stopped playing.
He said that when he got to college,

2142
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:56.130
he goes,
there was this attitude that you only have a few years,

2143
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:58.500
you have a couple of years to make an impression.

2144
02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:03.860
And he said the fucking sophistication of the drug use that he saw when he was

2145
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:07.650
in college in a big,
big time college football team.
He goes,

2146
02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.650
it was fucking crazy.
He goes,
it was crazy.

2147
02:07:10.651 --> 02:07:14.100
And it was widespread and it was from the top down.

2148
02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:15.960
Everybody knew what the fuck was going on.

2149
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:18.750
And there was an established protocol and they would tell you,
hey buddy,

2150
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:23.100
you're going to get tested on Friday,
so on Friday,
come in and,
and you know,

2151
02:07:23.101 --> 02:07:26.190
you're going to have to take your test.
And he said,
when he would get tested,

2152
02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:31.420
they would say,
okay,
here's your cop.
Um,
you know,
so go in there,
uh,

2153
02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:34.260
do your urine sample and then come out and bring it to me.

2154
02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:37.870
Like there was no one there while he did it.
No one watched.

2155
02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:41.590
They didn't tell if he had a rubber dick to didn't tell if he had a guy in there

2156
02:07:41.591 --> 02:07:43.600
waiting for him to piss in it for him.
He goes,

2157
02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:45.550
I could have had my cousin pissing a thing for me.

2158
02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.360
People would piss in bags and they would take that bag and strap it to their

2159
02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:53.260
body so it keep it body temperature and then put it onto your clothes.

2160
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:54.303
And then you would,
uh,

2161
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:57.730
get into the bathroom and you open up that bag and pour the contents into the,

2162
02:07:57.731 --> 02:08:00.520
uh,
the thing.
Sure.
So you'd have someone else's Piss.
He said,

2163
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:05.260
but they gave you all the time in the world to do it and he goes and everybody,

2164
02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:10.600
everybody,
everybody was doing steroids.
Every buddy he goes,

2165
02:08:10.601 --> 02:08:12.550
they weren't just doing steroids.
They would do an EPO.

2166
02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:16.170
They were doing all these drugs to maximize your endurance that we do in all

2167
02:08:16.190 --> 02:08:19.270
these recovery drugs they were doing.
He goes,
they were doing everything.

2168
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:22.690
Everybody's doing everything.
I believe it.
I totally believe,
I believe it too,

2169
02:08:22.691 --> 02:08:24.250
and I think that's what happened with Lance Armstrong.

2170
02:08:24.250 --> 02:08:26.400
I think this guy gotten into cycling.
Yeah.

2171
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:30.010
He got to the highest level of the sport and he got to the pros and he's like,

2172
02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:31.150
Oh shit.

2173
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:34.840
This is all about taking your own blood out and putting it back in your body.

2174
02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:37.750
There's about doing EPO.
This is about doing testosterone.

2175
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:40.900
This is about doing whatever the fuck you can do to recover so that you can

2176
02:08:40.901 --> 02:08:45.270
compete and then you've got the US Postal Service.
Okay.
Which is the,

2177
02:08:45.330 --> 02:08:49.040
the guys who are promoting his,
his event,
right?
He's warm.

2178
02:08:49.090 --> 02:08:51.310
He's the cyclist for the postal team.

2179
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:56.440
So now he's getting sued for not just the money that they paid him for winning

2180
02:08:56.650 --> 02:08:58.870
because you don't,
you have to sign something saying that you're on drugs.

2181
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:01.690
But because he was working for the government,

2182
02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:04.640
they say he's defrauded the government.
So the,

2183
02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:07.900
they can sue you for three times the damages Jesus.

2184
02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.560
So they're suing them for $100 million right now.
Yeah,

2185
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:15.430
it's pretty well the thing about,
I think what he did too,

2186
02:09:15.431 --> 02:09:19.180
and that like the why the perception is,
you know,

2187
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:24.190
different for lands in particular is that the light was shining brighter because

2188
02:09:24.191 --> 02:09:28.300
of how successful he was and then the way that he would defend himself,

2189
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:30.280
he was fucking vicious about it.

2190
02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:34.360
So people to sue people and then take them down publicly.

2191
02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.800
Like he was destroying people's ability to work,
make money,

2192
02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:41.830
support their families.
So it,
he was,

2193
02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:44.950
he was cold fucking blooded about defending himself,

2194
02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:49.180
which made him basically like a bigger dick throughout the whole thing.

2195
02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.470
So not just the cheater,

2196
02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:54.700
but a guy that was really fucking an asshole to everybody on the way.

2197
02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.250
That's what I want to hear.
A story.
Yeah.

2198
02:09:56.410 --> 02:10:00.280
I want to hear how he views it and I also want to hear what it was like to be

2199
02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:03.730
the focus of attention for a fucking dirty industry.
I mean,

2200
02:10:03.731 --> 02:10:06.880
it's a dirty business.
Do you watch the documentary?
I did.

2201
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:08.830
What was it like talking to him?
Interesting.

2202
02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:10.660
How long did you do I start for awhile.
Yeah.

2203
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:13.090
And we talked for a while on the phone.
I haven't met him in person.

2204
02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:16.510
I was in Austin.
I was going to invite them to my show,
but I'm like,
Eh,

2205
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:19.870
probably better.
Just talk to him when I see him.
If,
if and when I,

2206
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:24.190
Sam just talked to he considering doing?
Yeah,
his idea.
He reached out to me.
Wow.

2207
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:25.360
Yeah.
I think,
well listen,

2208
02:10:25.410 --> 02:10:28.090
you're not going to get a platform like this where you're going to reach

2209
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:30.820
millions of people and you can talk for three hours and I want to let you say

2210
02:10:30.821 --> 02:10:33.200
anything you want.
Yeah.
And I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.
I want,

2211
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:37.520
I want him to express himself as openly and as look.

2212
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:39.710
It's all on the table now.
They sue the shit out of him.

2213
02:10:39.711 --> 02:10:41.150
They took a fuck load of money from them.

2214
02:10:41.151 --> 02:10:43.610
They took away his ability to make a living.
I mean,

2215
02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.560
he's a guy that was the poster boy for this sport.

2216
02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:52.100
I mean,
if it wasn't for him,
who gives a fuck about cycling?

2217
02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:55.670
You got Greg Lamont and you got Lance Armstrong and that's it.

2218
02:10:55.671 --> 02:10:59.180
I don't know anybody else.
Do you know one other guy was cycles?
No,

2219
02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:02.980
I know Tony Hawk.
I don't know anybody else at skateboards.
Right?

2220
02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.150
Who the fuck out skateboard?
I'm sure there's other guys,

2221
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:08.660
but that's the guy that's the big name guy.
You know what I mean?

2222
02:11:08.661 --> 02:11:12.020
There's a lot of sports that have that like women's fighting.

2223
02:11:12.021 --> 02:11:14.780
Everybody knows who Ronda Rousey is.
There's a million other women fighters.

2224
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:17.300
Everybody knows who Ronda Rousey is.
It's so big.

2225
02:11:17.301 --> 02:11:19.400
She's so big now that like I was in,
uh,

2226
02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:24.640
I was in a hotel on fight night when she fought less and like just dudes that

2227
02:11:25.461 --> 02:11:30.461
you know are not fans of women's athletics.

2228
02:11:31.130 --> 02:11:33.630
We're all,
you know what I mean?
They're all walking around.
Just,

2229
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.230
I've just to tell you how,
like,
how much she's changed things.

2230
02:11:36.231 --> 02:11:39.340
Like they were like walking look and talking to like the bell bellhop.

2231
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:41.330
Where's the rousy fight on?
I got to go find the right.

2232
02:11:41.331 --> 02:11:43.710
Like I feel like that's how much it swung,
you know,

2233
02:11:43.711 --> 02:11:48.620
and she's changed it where like these fucking total misogynistic pigs,

2234
02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:52.610
we're still like,
I need to find that Rousey for.
Why would you assume that?

2235
02:11:52.611 --> 02:11:56.480
Just because they're dudes that their massages dick pig.
I just,
I'm an asshole.

2236
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:59.450
Because you're a guy.
Yeah.
I just looked at them and I was like,

2237
02:11:59.451 --> 02:12:01.310
these guys are pigs.
Yeah,
for sure.

2238
02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:05.000
If they like sports and they work out their pigs there,
these guys were pigs.

2239
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:09.860
These guys didn't work out.
Yeah.
Did you see what Beyonce did?

2240
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:14.900
Beyonce did the central park concert.
It was a free concert and uh,

2241
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:18.650
Dana white came up to me Saturday and after the fights and he pulls over his

2242
02:12:18.651 --> 02:12:22.430
iPhone.
He goes,
watch this.
Not The flip phone.
No,
he has an iPhone now.

2243
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:25.610
They make them use the iPhone because he's under some investigation.

2244
02:12:25.611 --> 02:12:28.300
So they have to be able to try and call her shit because of his,
uh,

2245
02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:32.040
they're getting sued because a bunch of shit going on.
Anyway.
He,
uh,

2246
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:36.400
shows me this video,
uh,
on his iPhone and it's a,

2247
02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:41.300
Beyonce has a free concert in central park and on this giant screens fucking

2248
02:12:41.301 --> 02:12:42.440
enormous.
A hundred foot screen.

2249
02:12:42.710 --> 02:12:47.710
She has all Ronda Rousey's words playing out like the script of it while Ron is

2250
02:12:48.471 --> 02:12:52.610
talking,
Ron is talking about not being a do nothing bitch.
She's like,

2251
02:12:52.611 --> 02:12:54.740
every muscle in my body has a functional purpose.

2252
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:58.250
I'm not some do nothing bitch sitting around waiting for some millionaire to

2253
02:12:58.251 --> 02:12:59.180

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:12.150
But to all those do nothing pitches out there that's like,
Hey,

2257
02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:18.380
I mean I don't want to work.
I went like,
we're trying to get lucrative.

2258
02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:22.990
I ain't trying to hustle that hard.
How lucrative are you willing to get?

2259
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.650
Cause I get lucrative.
I get pretty lucrative.
That's amazing.

2260
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:32.040
That's amazing.
Is that a shirt next week?
I'm trying to get a little quick.

2261
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:37.680
<v 0>I,

uh,
you know,</v>

2262
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:40.500
he's a appearance this weekend at the punchline.
By the way,

2263
02:13:40.501 --> 02:13:41.610
if you're in Sacramento,

2264
02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:46.160
he's one of the funniest fucking dude's is working today.
Fucking funny.

2265
02:13:46.170 --> 02:13:50.670
Look good.
He wrote me after I tweeted to him.
Thanks man.

2266
02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:51.600
It's going to be lucrative.

2267
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:57.330
We're both laughing about it as a play.

2268
02:13:59.070 --> 02:14:01.490
How lucrative do you get?
Cause I kept pretty low.

2269
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:05.100
I you be lucrative.

2270
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:11.920
He,
um,
when I was in Montreal,
I think I told you this,
I did a show every night,

2271
02:14:11.921 --> 02:14:14.040
an hour show every night.
Right.
So I would just ask,

2272
02:14:14.041 --> 02:14:18.150
I asked Tony to come by and like just to an opening set,
you know?
Right.

2273
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:22.690
Dude in fucking floored the place.
He's a monster.
Yeah.

2274
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:26.820
He floored it.
And he's only doing that now.
I mean,
he's doing some writing,

2275
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:29.400
but he's really concentrating on that.
Let's see.
That's it.

2276
02:14:29.401 --> 02:14:32.240
And that's how you get really good.
We had a conversation about a man.
I,

2277
02:14:32.241 --> 02:14:33.480
I told him,
I said,
dude,

2278
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:36.150
I think you're one of the best goddamn comics in the world.

2279
02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:39.420
I think you one of the best comics on the planet earth and people don't know

2280
02:14:39.421 --> 02:14:42.810
about you.
I go the,
the difference between your skill level,

2281
02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:45.750
your ability and what people know is so vast.

2282
02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:49.560
And it's because he's been writing so much writing on all these sitcoms and he's

2283
02:14:49.561 --> 02:14:51.360
got it.
He's very good at that.

2284
02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.360
But he's best at stand up his standup and he's a monster.

2285
02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.230
He's such an,
uh,
like a unique original voice.
Yeah.
Know people that don't,

2286
02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:02.190
one reminds me of him.
Like he's,

2287
02:15:02.191 --> 02:15:05.900
he's really a unique talent and he's such a good dude.
Yeah.

2288
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:09.900
I've been friends with him for like 24 years,
23 years.

2289
02:15:09.930 --> 02:15:13.800
He's got that fucking non aging black guy thing where I'm like,
what are you,

2290
02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:16.650
he won't tell me how old he is.
Well,
yeah,
and then you go,
like,

2291
02:15:16.651 --> 02:15:18.780
I was in New York at a club,
I forget where I,

2292
02:15:18.781 --> 02:15:23.781
which club I was in and he had a fucking head shot on there that looked 25 years

2293
02:15:24.451 --> 02:15:29.100
old and he had dreads.
And I was like,
how old is this shit,

2294
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:33.870
man?
How old is he?
Uh,
he's a vampire bro.
Yeah,
he's advanced flips upside down.

2295
02:15:33.970 --> 02:15:38.870
Yeah.
Um,
let me see how old he is.
We'll find out.
I'm really not right now.

2296
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.640
I'm going to Wikipedia the fucker.
That shit that's probably not on there.
Right.

2297
02:15:41.670 --> 02:15:46.670
It says he's only 43 it says he was born February 11th,

2298
02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:51.630
1972 43.
Okay.
That's bullshit.
Unless he was 15 when I met him.

2299
02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:55.860
No.
Yeah.
So that's a lie.
And how dare you.

2300
02:15:56.850 --> 02:16:00.480
But he might,
that might be true.
He won't tell you though.
If you ask him,

2301
02:16:00.481 --> 02:16:02.600
he won't tell you the stripper or that we've talked to.

2302
02:16:02.610 --> 02:16:06.860
She wouldn't tell us either.
I go,
how old are you?
I go,
I'm 48.
How old you?

2303
02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:14.340
I'm like come on lady.
Never tells her age.

2304
02:16:14.370 --> 02:16:18.550
I'm like yeah they do when they're 20.
Yeah.

2305
02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:23.550
Oh and can't believe.

2306
02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:28.700
And then I get now I don't ever knock it sir.

2307
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.120
I used to not get sort of

2308
02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:34.020
<v 1>that much.
Yeah.
Brain your beard son.
Yeah.
And I'm,
you get the fuck out of here.</v>

2309
02:16:34.090 --> 02:16:37.610
That man's beer.
Sorry sir.
We'll be with you in a minute sir.
I'm like,
alright,

2310
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:42.040
you gotta fucking Werewolf Beard and he would with a big ass gorilla beard like

2311
02:16:42.041 --> 02:16:46.630
that.
Or are sir.
Yeah,
for sure.
Absolutely.
Your goddamn man Tommy Buttons.
Yeah,

2312
02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:48.730
your man about to make a baby while you made a baby.

2313
02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.360
I may have to have a baby a couple of months away.
How's that feel?
I'm excited,

2314
02:16:52.361 --> 02:16:55.150
man.
I really am.
I think it's part of the reason is that,
uh,

2315
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.410
I think it's because I didn't have a baby at 25,
you know,

2316
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:03.700
so it's like something that I waited while we waited obviously,

2317
02:17:03.701 --> 02:17:05.410
and then you're more established.

2318
02:17:05.411 --> 02:17:09.370
I feel more like financially stable and emotionally ready for it,
so,
well,

2319
02:17:09.371 --> 02:17:13.540
it's perfect.
It's a perfect time.
I hear people go like,
is it,
are you terrified?

2320
02:17:13.570 --> 02:17:16.830
And I'm like,
no.
That's people that don't want any commitment in their life.
Yeah.

2321
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.840
I'm not terrified at all.
Those guys probably don't even have girlfriends.

2322
02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:23.200
All right.
Yeah,
I guess I never thought about it,
but I'm like,
no,

2323
02:17:23.201 --> 02:17:24.790
I'm excited for it.
I'm not terrified.

2324
02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:28.780
These people that can't imagine anybody living other than the way they live.

2325
02:17:29.050 --> 02:17:32.620
Right.
You know?
But you'll,
you'll get that from all sides.
People.

2326
02:17:32.930 --> 02:17:36.070
Are you ready for your life to be over?
What?
Who said that to you?

2327
02:17:36.430 --> 02:17:41.370
Just caught them off whatever they are.
Yeah.
Right.
Life to be over the,

2328
02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.900
you know what's equally annoying?
No,
and I got to say,

2329
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:47.380
I really found this very knowing when I was single and I didn't have kids.

2330
02:17:47.410 --> 02:17:51.070
It didn't really bug the shit out of me that people would tell me that you have

2331
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:53.620
to have kids in order to be like a mature adult.

2332
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:56.050
Like when are you going to settle down enough kids when you're going to,

2333
02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:59.800
when are you going to like guys that I knew that had kids that were fucking

2334
02:17:59.801 --> 02:18:01.240
miserable.
And by the way,

2335
02:18:01.530 --> 02:18:05.080
every one who told me this to a man,

2336
02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:08.500
everyone is divorced.
Yeah.
Every single one.

2337
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.010
Every single one that told me to get married and have children is fucking

2338
02:18:12.011 --> 02:18:16.360
divorced.
Yeah.
Every one of them.
I'm going to like seven,
eight,

2339
02:18:16.361 --> 02:18:20.290
nine guys.
Yeah.
I've,
I've never believed that.

2340
02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:25.380
I certainly never lectured to is shit telling people to live their lives the way

2341
02:18:25.571 --> 02:18:28.330
you're living your life.
When it can.
Only way you can do it.

2342
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:31.540
Everybody's got to waste.
A lot of people are weird man.

2343
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:34.990
Some people they just want it.
Like I have a friend,
my friend Steve Maxwell,

2344
02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.000
he doesn't have a place to live.
He just travels.
He goes from town to town.

2345
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000
He's a a really famous as far as that world strength and conditioning coach and

2346
02:18:45.401 --> 02:18:49.180
a like a personal trainer and he goes all over the world like you will,

2347
02:18:49.181 --> 02:18:53.350
you'll see his Instagram,
he's in Fiji sometimes just training people,

2348
02:18:53.351 --> 02:18:56.080
training people.
He'll put together these little small seminars.

2349
02:18:56.260 --> 02:19:00.040
The small groups of people will meet them every week.
Like they'll say,
okay,

2350
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:03.820
like you know,
they have some things set up with like 10 people we'll meet,

2351
02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:05.410
you know,
in this one place.

2352
02:19:05.411 --> 02:19:07.600
And then he's going to coach them for like five or six days.

2353
02:19:07.601 --> 02:19:11.020
So they have like a getaway and he puts these together and then Jim's,

2354
02:19:11.021 --> 02:19:14.560
we'll have them come in and he'll teach seminars at their gyms and he just lives

2355
02:19:14.561 --> 02:19:18.580
out of a bag.
I couldn't live like that,
but he can write.

2356
02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:21.850
But I would never lecture that guy.
Wouldn't,
I wouldn't like it,
but he can do it.

2357
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:24.220
Sure.
Tom Rhodes for the longest,

2358
02:19:24.221 --> 02:19:28.040
Tom Rhodes has a fucking apartment now in Los Angeles.
Does when did

2359
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:32.120
<v 0>he get it?
Decided really recently.
He said,
I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,</v>

2360
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:35.350
I'm going to stay here at the store where he was a hanging around the story,

2361
02:19:35.390 --> 02:19:39.820
you know that secret comics bar,
the little comics bar back.
Yeah.
Um,

2362
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:43.130
there were all in comics are allowed to go there and hang out there and comics

2363
02:19:43.131 --> 02:19:45.380
friends.
He was,
we were hanging around back there and he's like,
dude,

2364
02:19:45.381 --> 02:19:49.340
I got apartment.
I hope.
What?
Yeah.
Well how long were you a renegade for?

2365
02:19:49.341 --> 02:19:51.470
He goes like 10 years.
For 10 years.

2366
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:53.360
He came to my place last year and didn't have it,

2367
02:19:53.361 --> 02:19:56.570
so I know it's gotta be a reason.
Yeah.
He was staying in people's places.

2368
02:19:56.810 --> 02:20:00.890
He was a stem level.
The towels.
He's a great guy.
He's a great guy.
A great dude.

2369
02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:04.040
Yeah.
And he was up,
he also is one of those guys that a,

2370
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:08.660
he's a world traveling comic.
Oh yeah.
You know,
he's done poor one.

2371
02:20:08.661 --> 02:20:13.100
We call in the next week and has done that kind of thing forever.

2372
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:16.970
Forever.
Forever.
Yeah.
I mean,
he's been doing standup for 25 years at least.

2373
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:21.590
And Out of those 25 years,
he's been touring around the world for 15.
Yeah.

2374
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:25.920
At least.
Yeah.
At least he used to have a show in Holland.
Yes.

2375
02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:28.830
Where was the late night show?
It was a late night show.

2376
02:20:28.831 --> 02:20:31.910
Was like a big time show and it was the something,

2377
02:20:31.911 --> 02:20:34.930
something she'll like some other guy's name starring Tom Rhodes.

2378
02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:39.020
It was like the like say if you like instead of like the Thompson girls show was

2379
02:20:39.021 --> 02:20:42.590
like the Jamie Vernon show starring Thompson Jura and like,

2380
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:46.850
it was real weird.
Yeah.
And he was,
I heard it that,
you know,
he was like,

2381
02:20:46.851 --> 02:20:50.330
they're Letterman.
He was,
he did that for quite awhile.

2382
02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:52.760
He's a,
but he's,

2383
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:57.890
he's decided now he wants to live in an apartment.

2384
02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:02.060
Yeah.
And he's had a wife for a while too.
He travels with his was great.
She,

2385
02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:05.390
she's great.
Yeah.
He,
um,
that mean he enjoyed that life.

2386
02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:07.370
You can live any way you want it,
man.
Do you know?

2387
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:12.350
I think his mother's ours in time.
Everybody's got their own thing,
man.

2388
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:16.040
For some people,
having a kid is the worst fucking idea on the planet.
I get that.

2389
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:18.190
I totally understand that.
Yeah.
I think that's,

2390
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:20.270
those are the people that are telling me,
are you out of your mind?

2391
02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:22.910
But there's a weird thing,
man.
And when people like this and dude,

2392
02:21:22.911 --> 02:21:26.220
when are you going to settle down now?
But yet you need to have a kid like,
whoa,

2393
02:21:26.221 --> 02:21:30.440
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
It looks like you.
It's easy for you to say,
you know,

2394
02:21:30.441 --> 02:21:33.020
you're not a man until you have a kid.
You know you're not,
you're not mature.

2395
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:34.100
You know?
You know,
like,

2396
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:39.130
I think it's really obnoxious and gross to assume that everyone would want that

2397
02:21:40.721 --> 02:21:43.610
at even like at any point that like,
I think that it's totally legit.

2398
02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:46.310
There's somebody who's 50 60 70 years old,

2399
02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:49.430
never had kids and is totally fulfilled and happy.
Absolutely.

2400
02:21:49.431 --> 02:21:50.181
Why wouldn't they be?

2401
02:21:50.181 --> 02:21:52.910
You tell me you can't contribute unless you make another human being.
Yeah.

2402
02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:55.850
That's silly.
That's silly.
Yeah.
I mean,
what is your contribution in life?

2403
02:21:55.851 --> 02:21:58.190
Your contribution in life is how you affect other people.

2404
02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:01.450
Whether you influence them in a positive way,
whether you,

2405
02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:04.370
they think about you with love,
what they think about you with happiness,

2406
02:22:04.371 --> 02:22:07.610
the people that you've interacted with personally,
the people that you know,

2407
02:22:07.730 --> 02:22:09.080
that's what your legacy is.

2408
02:22:09.430 --> 02:22:13.910
And if you're a guy who thinks that having a kid is the end all be all,

2409
02:22:13.911 --> 02:22:18.180
but then your kid turns out to be fucked up.
Well what did you do dummy?
Yeah,

2410
02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.990
you're ruined your kid.
That was your contribution,
your contribution.

2411
02:22:20.991 --> 02:22:25.100
You fucked it up and he had one big project and you fucked it up.
Yup.

2412
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:26.250
You're sitting there drawing decks.

2413
02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:30.420
<v 2>No,
that's an old drawing.
But it's yours.</v>

2414
02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:33.630
Truly old soul.
Yet our old,
yeah,
that's true.

2415
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:36.020
But we were talking about the world's biggest tick,
so,

2416
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:40.010
so you had a draw is inspiring.
You felt compelled.
Yeah.

2417
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:42.120
Are you going to keep doing that once you have kid Tommy?

2418
02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.880
You got to think drawn dicks.
I think so,
but I'll just call them terrain.

2419
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:49.440
Influence your kid by drawn techs.
I'm going to have a real tough time with,
uh,

2420
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:53.010
being mature.
I feel like,
well,
I don't think you have to be.
Yeah.

2421
02:22:53.011 --> 02:22:57.090
Well I'll be very,
we already have a system in place where we're trying to,
uh,

2422
02:22:57.270 --> 02:23:00.120
we're going to do,
uh,
burps are one thumbs up,

2423
02:23:00.121 --> 02:23:04.080
but farts are two thumbs up because farts are fucking awesome.
What do you mean?

2424
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:06.450
Like whenever,
whenever anyone farts around the kid,

2425
02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:09.150
what I'm going to go to with them about you and your wife just rip them in front

2426
02:23:09.151 --> 02:23:13.380
of each other.
Yeah,
sure.
But my belt,

2427
02:23:13.381 --> 02:23:16.080
has it been getting stronger?
They're better now.
You're working on it?
Yeah,

2428
02:23:16.081 --> 02:23:19.680
I think so.
I don't know.
I don't know more probiotics.
I just,

2429
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:20.514
I just feel that I can,

2430
02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:24.210
I feel like I'm having them come up from the diaphragm now and they're just more

2431
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:27.810
powerful,
you know.
Have you always farmed in front of your girlfriends?
Um,

2432
02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:31.530
not right away,
but eventually I'll,

2433
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:34.470
I'd usually wait how many dates in,
oh,
it's a while.
I mean,

2434
02:23:34.471 --> 02:23:37.110
I make sure I'm in there.
I'm getting in there pretty often and then I do it.

2435
02:23:37.111 --> 02:23:41.490
I don't make sure you're fucked them good a while.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like,

2436
02:23:41.491 --> 02:23:42.760
this is a regular thing here.
Come.

2437
02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:46.740
Do you know about Dara to tell you about the first time I fired in front of her?

2438
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:49.500
No,
this is bold.
This is bold man.

2439
02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:52.680
We've been dating for for a little while probably like,
I dunno,
five,

2440
02:23:52.681 --> 02:23:56.850
six months or something and I'm at her place.
It's a Saturday morning.

2441
02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:01.230
I still remember him watching college football and I think she was making

2442
02:24:01.231 --> 02:24:05.580
breakfast or something.
And then life is great life.
I'm sitting on the couch.

2443
02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:08.310
Yeah,
I'm sitting on her couch wearing boxers,

2444
02:24:08.311 --> 02:24:13.311
watching TV and she comes and she sat next to me and I felt a fart come in and I

2445
02:24:14.191 --> 02:24:17.520
grabbed her arm and I took her hand and put it between my legs and I farted on

2446
02:24:17.521 --> 02:24:19.170
her hand,
first fart.

2447
02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:25.200
And I just remember her going like,
oh my God.
And she goes,

2448
02:24:25.201 --> 02:24:27.210
it smells like garbage.
It smells like garbage.

2449
02:24:27.211 --> 02:24:29.880
She kept saying that and she was like,
what the fuck?
And later,

2450
02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:35.400
like now she told me,
do you realize how crazy that was?
And I was like,
yeah,

2451
02:24:35.401 --> 02:24:39.210
I didn't realize it at the time.
If I was who I am now,

2452
02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:41.950
I would have fucking cut you off right then and there like that.
Really?

2453
02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:44.940
She says that like,
she was like,
clearly I was not in a good place

2454
02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:50.700
to stay with a guy that farted on my hand.
But it was funny.
Right.

2455
02:24:50.701 --> 02:24:53.700
It was really funny.
Yeah.
So why would she not?
I think she just,

2456
02:24:53.701 --> 02:24:56.460
I mean I think she was joking right in a way,
but she was just like,

2457
02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:01.760
like for a first fart to be on someone's hand worked out though.

2458
02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:05.730
Worked out well you knew she was the one I knew.
I knew that was,

2459
02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:08.580
that was essentially my proposal.
When did she fart in front of you first?

2460
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:12.630
I mean afterwards.
I actually don't remember her first one,

2461
02:25:12.631 --> 02:25:14.880
but I'm getting a lot of them now.
It's made up for it.
Uh,

2462
02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:19.290
so she's been ripping some pregnancy farts are fucking powerful man.

2463
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:24.040
Does that bum you out?
No,
never.
Cause,
cause the thing is like,
I'm not something

2464
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.000
<v 3>that's ever,
that has ever been like oo far.
Like,
it just doesn't,</v>

2465
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:31.000
it doesn't have that effect on the first girl that's ever farted in front of
you.

2466
02:25:31.090 --> 02:25:32.060
No.
God,
no.

2467
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:36.900
So you just attract that kind of Gal.
I mean,

2468
02:25:36.901 --> 02:25:40.450
like I've been with girls that didn't obviously,
but yeah,
no,

2469
02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:45.430
if I dated you for awhile,
you fart.
It's okay.
No.
When you date girls for a while,

2470
02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:50.020
how do you know when it's time to unleash the hounds?
I mean,

2471
02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:53.980
it's different with every time it is and you got to feel it out.
But it's like,

2472
02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:56.560
I think it's a,
it's are you still in the,
like,

2473
02:25:56.561 --> 02:26:00.400
I'm trying to make an impression phase more.
Have you settled into like,

2474
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:04.450
you know who you are,
who you are?
Yeah.
That's hard.
Right?

2475
02:26:04.820 --> 02:26:09.220
Do you not fart in front your wife?
If she accidentally walks in after I farted,

2476
02:26:09.221 --> 02:26:12.580
I claim it.
Yeah.
And does she fired her knee,
hips?
Uh,
she has,

2477
02:26:12.581 --> 02:26:16.120
she has more than once,
but I like it.
Let's say in bed.
She won't like,

2478
02:26:16.121 --> 02:26:20.800
like grab her ankles.
They go,
here we go.

2479
02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:26.500
I do some really obnoxious shit that's really obnoxious.
But like,

2480
02:26:26.501 --> 02:26:30.520
if you're laying in bed tonight and you're a whatever,
winding down,

2481
02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.580
you feel a Fart,
come do you get up and try to be polite.
You do.

2482
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:36.430
We'll just kind of let it sneak out or just not only fart in front of my friends

2483
02:26:36.970 --> 02:26:41.530
like that.
So what would you do though?
Would you leave the room?
Uh,
yeah.

2484
02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.470
Most Lao or hold it in.
Wow.

2485
02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:49.890
Common courtesy is ridiculous.
And Tommy,
well,
I mean,

2486
02:26:50.310 --> 02:26:52.810
people don't want to smell their husbands farts.
I know,

2487
02:26:52.811 --> 02:26:56.740
but I lost if I thought in any way we keep it from blowing me.
Yeah.
Then then.

2488
02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:01.240
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I guess it,
yeah,
I hear Ya.
It that way.
Yeah.

2489
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:06.430
I'll hold my farts.
I'll hold my farts during sex to you.
Sure.
Yeah.

2490
02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.150
That's good.
But sometimes post-coital they,
they come out.

2491
02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:12.190
A friend of mine was a camera man.
Um,

2492
02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:15.760
he was camera man on whose camera?

2493
02:27:15.761 --> 02:27:17.590
Man on a TV show that I was on,

2494
02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:21.670
but he had also done some camera work on porn when he was starting out to,

2495
02:27:21.671 --> 02:27:25.330
you know,
to make money.
And he said,
ah,
there was just one guy.

2496
02:27:25.331 --> 02:27:30.010
It's like this big bulky bodybuilder guy who just would rip the most disgusting

2497
02:27:30.011 --> 02:27:32.950
far.
It's while he's fucking these grantees fucking while he's fucking him.

2498
02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:35.090
And because he just ate a lot of proteins.
Yeah.

2499
02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:39.940
And he was just farts unload these farts and these poor girls and they look,

2500
02:27:39.941 --> 02:27:42.850
they have to work.
Yeah.
Cause like,
like when you,

2501
02:27:42.851 --> 02:27:46.870
I guess when you're a guy and you're a porn star and he was this big muscular

2502
02:27:46.871 --> 02:27:49.150
black guy,
I guess first of all,

2503
02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:53.650
there's this thing where it's not matter of whether or not you're going to have

2504
02:27:53.651 --> 02:27:57.790
sex.
Yeah.
Like these girls are getting paid to have sex with you on camera.

2505
02:27:57.970 --> 02:28:00.910
It's not whether or not they're gonna want to do certain sexy things,

2506
02:28:00.911 --> 02:28:04.270
whether they're going to like it or not.
Like that's out the window now.
It's,

2507
02:28:04.271 --> 02:28:06.190
you're going to come,
I'm going to come in your face.

2508
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:09.370
You got to come in their face.
I'm,
I'm gonna put it in your ass.

2509
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:12.100
Like we already worked this out right in the contract.
Put it in your house.

2510
02:28:12.310 --> 02:28:14.650
We're going to ask the mouth,
I'm going to come in your face.

2511
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.690
You're going to suck my balls,
I'm a jerk off in your hair.

2512
02:28:16.691 --> 02:28:21.270
Like it's all worked out.
Yeah.
So like this smile afterwards to snow like this,

2513
02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:22.113
this like

2514
02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:26.510
<v 0>there's no romance to it.
Yeah.
There's no,</v>

2515
02:28:26.511 --> 02:28:29.720
there's no special anciently no.
Well No,

2516
02:28:29.721 --> 02:28:32.060
definitely no intimacy because whatever you're doing,

2517
02:28:32.061 --> 02:28:33.980
you're doing in front of a gang of people.

2518
02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:37.790
There's a boom Mike hanging over the bed.
There's camera man.

2519
02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:41.980
There's a craft service table that you've been hitting up.
And uh,

2520
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:45.260
I guess he's like,
I don't have to impress anybody.
I'm just going to fart

2521
02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:51.860
during sex is my line.
I've never done that.
I've never done that man.

2522
02:28:51.890 --> 02:28:53.870
So people don't have a problem with my,
I have a friend that,

2523
02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:58.940
that also was the camera guy for porns and not anymore,
but he told me,

2524
02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:02.510
he like,
he's like,
I go,
what?
What's like the grossest thing?
And he goes,

2525
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:06.980
the grossest thing by far are the smells because he's like,
you know,
you're like,

2526
02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:11.870
I would come like underneath and be like kind of position under a guy's ass and

2527
02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:16.280
bald slap,
you know,
for that underneath shot.
And he's like,

2528
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.070
just all of their smells.
I'm just like,

2529
02:29:19.071 --> 02:29:22.580
just inhaling them and then some will be like,
yeah,
get,
get another side of that.

2530
02:29:22.581 --> 02:29:26.210
And you go back down there like the worst part.
He said just smelling stuff.

2531
02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:28.790
Oh yeah.
It's pretty horrendous.

2532
02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:33.080
Wondering what happens if someone has a yeast infection and it's just stinks.

2533
02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:35.090
Do they just have to man up?

2534
02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:40.280
I think they probably go until someone's like,
I'm gonna Puke.
Or,

2535
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:44.710
or like the guys,
like it won't get hard if I'm smelling this,
you know?

2536
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:49.010
Oh God,
that's a,
that's a smell.

2537
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:53.700
Did that yeast infection smell is nature's all alarm signal?
It is.
Yeah.

2538
02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:58.190
Let's talk about,
I know your favorite topic.
Ohio state,

2539
02:29:58.191 --> 02:30:02.220
Virginia Tech kicking off.
What are you talking about?
College football.
Oh,

2540
02:30:03.010 --> 02:30:05.240
big game.
Oh,
you're talking because Jamie's here.
Yeah,

2541
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:09.260
he's got a stupid fucking house and he's like,
he's all excited.
No,
no,
no,
no,

2542
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:14.990
no.
It's,
it's just exciting.
That's all.
What do you,
what's excited about you?

2543
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.050
Me excites you about it.
Right?

2544
02:30:17.051 --> 02:30:20.300
I feel the same way about college football that you do about fights.
Impossible.

2545
02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:23.930
I really,
I really do make sense.
Why?
Cause I get paid to talk about fights.

2546
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:27.020
I'm a huge guy on ESPN.
You have never seen it.
I didn't know.

2547
02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:30.530
What did you do that they are offered you that Gig?
100%.
Really?

2548
02:30:30.570 --> 02:30:32.630
Yeah we'd be good at it.
Um,

2549
02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:35.780
I feel like I could do like the roundtable stuff right now.

2550
02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:39.440
I couldn't do like the commentating cause you do liquid Dennis Miller used to do

2551
02:30:39.441 --> 02:30:42.710
where you'd come in,
you know that's like [inaudible].
That's cool.
Wow.

2552
02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:45.710
That's horrible.
And I hate that role.

2553
02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:48.260
I like a two man commentating booth for,

2554
02:30:48.270 --> 02:30:51.200
for football or like your play about your color guy comment.

2555
02:30:51.860 --> 02:30:56.060
I like that setup of like somebody's telling you what's happening and the,

2556
02:30:56.061 --> 02:30:57.730
you know the analyst,
the analyst.

2557
02:30:57.750 --> 02:31:02.600
Once you really get into it and you see a really good analyst and in football

2558
02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:06.830
you really appreciate what the way they're highlighting things for you.

2559
02:31:06.831 --> 02:31:10.880
It's like what you do with like when you explain what,
what just happened,
right.

2560
02:31:11.010 --> 02:31:14.990
The lay person just goes like that guy's good.
Or like he fucked him up.

2561
02:31:15.930 --> 02:31:20.060
You know,
when you explain how it happens.
Right.
I love that in like,
I think Kirk

2562
02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:23.310
<v 2>curb street who's an Ohio state guy is the best at it.</v>

2563
02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:28.340
Like [inaudible] you saw basically a pass throne and a touchdown score and

2564
02:31:28.901 --> 02:31:33.750
you're like great paths.
But he explains that this guy,
the defensive play,

2565
02:31:33.810 --> 02:31:38.550
how the coverage broke down,
what the quarterback saw,
how it developed.
I love,

2566
02:31:38.551 --> 02:31:40.530
I love that aspect of it.
So you love the,

2567
02:31:40.531 --> 02:31:44.910
the strategic aspect of setting up the plays and seeing how something works.

2568
02:31:44.911 --> 02:31:47.270
Yeah,
I love that.
And I,
and I just love the environment.

2569
02:31:47.271 --> 02:31:49.590
I like college football the most.
Why do you like college the most?

2570
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:54.120
I don't know man.
I think it's because I like,
you know,
I like the tradition.

2571
02:31:54.270 --> 02:31:57.180
I like the,
the rivalries,
they feel more genuine.

2572
02:31:57.210 --> 02:32:01.920
They feel like there's genuine hatred between teams.
Um,

2573
02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:04.560
you know,
the,
we're talking like a hundred year old programs,
you know,

2574
02:32:04.561 --> 02:32:08.310
like these or these or they've had a football team since like,
you know,

2575
02:32:08.490 --> 02:32:11.920
sometimes like 1898 shit like that.
You know,
we're like,

2576
02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:15.540
it's been there that long.
There's just,
there's just a passionate about it.

2577
02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:19.260
I Dunno.
I just,
I love being around it.
I love seeing the games.

2578
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:22.600
That's crazy.
Um,
you've always been like this,

2579
02:32:22.650 --> 02:32:24.300
this is something you've always been excited about.

2580
02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:26.340
College football or was it something he says?
I was a kid,

2581
02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:31.520
says he only did what the gets me about college versus pro is that like you have

2582
02:32:31.711 --> 02:32:36.390
to follow all these young students that are playing football.
Right.

2583
02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:37.740
You have to know who they are.

2584
02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:41.160
You mean like if you're going to be like a super fan of the game.
I mean,

2585
02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:44.220
every year they're turning over,
right?
Oh yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.

2586
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:46.500
Have like three years possibly.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2587
02:32:46.501 --> 02:32:50.820
Four years Max and then they're gone and you have new guys in it.
Could,
you know,

2588
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:56.100
and I can tell like my level of,
because sometimes there's some,

2589
02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:58.430
there's certain years or,
or,
or,
or a,
uh,

2590
02:32:58.710 --> 02:33:03.710
a certain number of years where I'll have a more laid back fandom to it or like,

2591
02:33:04.291 --> 02:33:07.890
I don't really know,
you know,
like the details like,
but you know,

2592
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:10.470
a bunch of people.
Yeah,
I will.
But like,

2593
02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:14.430
I think this year I've been super busy.
Um,
you know,

2594
02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:19.460
I didn't pay as much attention definitely to like recruiting classes and stuff

2595
02:33:19.561 --> 02:33:22.410
that I've,
that I pay attention to before.
You know,
what,
why,

2596
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:26.220
why college over like NFL?
You know,
I mean,

2597
02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:30.710
I like the stuff that I talked about,
like the,
the,
the passion stuff.
I love,

2598
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:33.840
I love,
I feel like it's more,
it's more genuine.
I feel like it's more,

2599
02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:37.080
there really are like,
there's a real passion for the game.

2600
02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:39.990
Part of it is because probably that a lot of those kids are trying to make it to

2601
02:33:39.991 --> 02:33:44.520
the NFL.
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.
They're fucking killing themselves to make it.

2602
02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:50.180
Um,
you know,
like I said,
the rivalries feel like they,
they feel more joy,

2603
02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:54.210
more authentically,
just genuine and real.
I,
I,
you know,

2604
02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:59.370
Ohio State,
Michigan,
um,
you know,
Florida state and Miami,

2605
02:33:59.371 --> 02:34:01.810
Georgia,
Florida,
like those kinds of games or just like,

2606
02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:06.810
or UCLA now I guess there'll be Ucla,
USC or USC,

2607
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.730
Stanford,
the last few years.

2608
02:34:08.850 --> 02:34:11.960
You root for your college team that you went to school.
And now my,

2609
02:34:12.210 --> 02:34:14.730
my school was a fucking tiny d two school.
I just,

2610
02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:17.620
there's just programs that you grew up watching,
you know,

2611
02:34:17.621 --> 02:34:22.420
that you're just kind of crashed.
So alien to me.
Really?
Yeah.
It's so fun to me.

2612
02:34:22.421 --> 02:34:25.960
I don't know what it is,
man.
I just,
I love,
I love it.
I love the,

2613
02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.540
I love the environment.
You know?
I love it.

2614
02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:33.100
I hear people talking about like the NFL and like this,
this Tom Brady thing.

2615
02:34:33.101 --> 02:34:37.270
Just that people won't stop talking about that flat gate really fucking got some

2616
02:34:37.271 --> 02:34:38.770
legs and went,
never stopped.

2617
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:43.120
Now he's been acquitted or they dropped the charges.

2618
02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:47.200
The federal judge threw out the suspension.

2619
02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:52.560
Basically decided that the commissioner couldn't punish him in the way that he

2620
02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.260
did.
One of the words,
it just,

2621
02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:00.820
you just ruled that you don't have the right to do that in this case,

2622
02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:03.510
Huh?
They can do that.

2623
02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:07.810
They just decide that you don't have the right to suspend somebody,
I guess.

2624
02:35:07.811 --> 02:35:11.980
I guess.
I mean,
I,
I'd never seen it really go this far before.
What look like,

2625
02:35:11.981 --> 02:35:15.130
I mean,
you know,
I'm sure someone's going to explain it better than I can,

2626
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:17.010
but like the commissioner said,
you know,

2627
02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:21.580
you're suspended for games and you guys are fine.
This and that for your party,

2628
02:35:21.581 --> 02:35:26.290
you know,
for this,
uh,
what I'm accusing you of,
which is the diff,
the flooding,

2629
02:35:26.291 --> 02:35:27.340
the footballs,
right,
right.

2630
02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:32.940
And then he appealed and then they went back and forth and then this federal

2631
02:35:33.461 --> 02:35:37.270
judge was gonna rule whether or not the suspension could be upheld or thrown
out.

2632
02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:42.300
And he'd ruled that it was like that the commissioner didn't have the authority

2633
02:35:43.421 --> 02:35:48.421
to do that even though he's suspended a lot of other people before for a lot of

2634
02:35:48.821 --> 02:35:51.190
other things.
And there's never been,

2635
02:35:52.090 --> 02:35:56.530
I've never seen it thrown out like that before.
Now how does that work?

2636
02:35:56.531 --> 02:36:00.460
Because they also took away their draft picks.
Right.

2637
02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:04.240
And find them a good amount of money so they have to pay that money back.

2638
02:36:04.270 --> 02:36:06.760
That's what,
I don't know.
I think they're trying to,
people were like,

2639
02:36:06.761 --> 02:36:08.500
well what are we going to get our drafts picked back?

2640
02:36:08.501 --> 02:36:10.480
Are we going to get the money back?

2641
02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:12.520
Like all those things I think are still up in the air.

2642
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:15.790
But didn't that guy destroy his phone?
He did.
He did.

2643
02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:17.350
He did destroy one of his phones.
Yeah.

2644
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:23.010
So they said that one of the big things is that like if it doesn't prove that he

2645
02:36:23.201 --> 02:36:26.560
didn't do anything wrong or that he didn't do what he's being accused of all

2646
02:36:26.561 --> 02:36:27.160
that,
the,

2647
02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:31.870
that the judgment is saying is that you can't suspend him for these four games.

2648
02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:35.520
Now what's the benefit of having a,
a softer ball?
Quits a,

2649
02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:37.900
it's about preference thing.
You know,
like some quarter,

2650
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:41.900
every quarter back is different,
you know,
and like the uh,

2651
02:36:41.901 --> 02:36:46.901
a slightly deflated ball has it an easier grip as when some people argue,

2652
02:36:47.141 --> 02:36:47.291
you know,

2653
02:36:47.291 --> 02:36:52.000
they don't like it super full because it's really hard and sometimes it's a

2654
02:36:52.001 --> 02:36:56.620
harder grip.
So a slightly slightly deflated ball,
you know,

2655
02:36:56.621 --> 02:36:59.230
these guys,
it's like any sport,
like got,
you know,

2656
02:36:59.231 --> 02:37:03.700
the basketball guy might like his fresh pair of sneakers and make sure,
you know,

2657
02:37:03.701 --> 02:37:05.170
you see the guys,
they put the powder on it.

2658
02:37:05.171 --> 02:37:08.800
It's just like a personal preference thing.
So some guys like it,

2659
02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:11.320
that full grip and some guys like it slightly deflated.

2660
02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:16.100
What a massive distraction for people to like,
Oh yeah.
Many people over

2661
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.240
<v 3>the last year have been talking about deflated footballs.
Unbelievable.</v>

2662
02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:23.510
I've never heard a single thing since.
Corked bats.

2663
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:27.410
Remember the corked bats controversy during the,
Oh yeah,
sure.

2664
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:31.670
The guys would drill holes in their bat and put Cork in the center of their bat

2665
02:37:31.671 --> 02:37:35.510
because apparently it gives more spring to the ball and you would get more

2666
02:37:35.511 --> 02:37:37.960
distance out of a home runs.
Yeah.

2667
02:37:38.390 --> 02:37:41.090
That's the last time I remember something being like,

2668
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:42.170
I don't remember who it was,

2669
02:37:42.171 --> 02:37:45.420
but there was some famous player who broke a bat and then the,

2670
02:37:45.421 --> 02:37:49.460
the bad cork in it.
Yeah,
I remember everybody was like,
sure.
Rachel.
Outrageous.

2671
02:37:49.461 --> 02:37:53.750
Yeah,
no,
let me be part of it obviously is because he's,
you know,
he's Tom Brady.

2672
02:37:53.751 --> 02:37:57.330
So it's the,
the,
it's like going back to the lance thing.
It's like,
you know,

2673
02:37:57.350 --> 02:38:01.130
everyone's watching them there that they just won the Superbowl there.
You know,

2674
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:04.530
he's the guy,
he's handsome.
He's Gary.
Dude.

2675
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.790
Do you know how much money has fucking wife has made?

2676
02:38:07.850 --> 02:38:10.820
I've read a lot of different stats,

2677
02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:15.880
but apparently it's nothing short of $250 million or $400 million.

2678
02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:22.070
He apparently has made $150 million and she has made 400 million from modeling.

2679
02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:26.420
From looking pretty yeah.
For being,
yeah.
That's it.
I mean,

2680
02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.210
I don't have any idea what she sounds like when she talks.

2681
02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:33.410
She is kind of a deeper,
uh,
she loves the guy,
older bands,

2682
02:38:33.450 --> 02:38:37.970
shakes and wanting to families.
She has that Portuguese accent.
Wow.
But I mean,

2683
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:41.800
stop and think about that.
You can make that much money as a supermodel.
Yeah.

2684
02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:45.170
That's more money than Bo Jackson never made his entire career.
Yeah.

2685
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:46.340
It's really crazy.

2686
02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:51.520
400 million bucks dam and he's a,

2687
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:54.550
he's a fucking one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time,
right?
Yeah.

2688
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:58.940
Without a doubt.
Without a doubt.
He can't even come close to that.
It's not even,

2689
02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:03.830
it's not if,
if that's the real figure.
It's not even close quarterbacks,
man.

2690
02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:08.860
That's a tough gig because those dudes are all running at you trying to smash

2691
02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:14.330
you.
Yeah.
They say paint man.
He can't feel his fingers.
Yeah.

2692
02:39:14.331 --> 02:39:15.170
He can't feel his fingertips.

2693
02:39:15.171 --> 02:39:17.810
And he's been told a lot of times that it's never coming back.
Yeah.

2694
02:39:17.930 --> 02:39:20.330
And he had that neck injury where they were like,
you're never coming back.

2695
02:39:20.331 --> 02:39:25.130
And that's how much he loves playing.
That he,
you know,
thought through it.

2696
02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:28.580
What did they do for his neck?
They did that Regena King Shit.

2697
02:39:28.581 --> 02:39:32.850
That shit I had done on my knee had a crazy surgery done.
And then surgery.
Yeah,

2698
02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:36.770
he had surgery for sure.
So they're probably trimmed back the disc.

2699
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:40.520
You know what they're doing now,
man.
They're giving people stem cell shots.

2700
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:44.210
Really?
Oh Dude.
I got one of my shoulder.
Did you do that thing by the way,

2701
02:39:44.211 --> 02:39:47.050
when your kids were born,
where you like,
yes,
you did that right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2702
02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:51.200
Banked the,
uh,
this embryotic but apparently there's a better way to do that now.

2703
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:56.690
Um,
I think they use placenta now for that too.
They,
uh,
they used to use the uh,

2704
02:39:56.691 --> 02:39:59.270
the cord,
but now I believe they use placenta.

2705
02:39:59.330 --> 02:40:03.080
They gave us a whole kit and they were supposed to bring,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2706
02:40:03.210 --> 02:40:06.380
I'll look into it cause I think there's an another more effective way.
Really.

2707
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:10.280
Yeah.
The uh,
the stem cells though that the,
they get from the placenta.

2708
02:40:10.281 --> 02:40:13.830
It's really fascinating stuff man.
They're a taking these,

2709
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:17.850
<v 1>I guess it's amniotic.
I guess that's the word.
[inaudible] and a,</v>

2710
02:40:17.851 --> 02:40:21.600
they take these stem cells from prom placenta and they're shooting them in the

2711
02:40:21.601 --> 02:40:24.810
athletes and uh,
it's amazing it comes out of this,

2712
02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:28.770
it comes down to this tube where there's,
it's liquid nitrogens in it,

2713
02:40:28.771 --> 02:40:32.370
so smokes coming out of it cause it's frozen before they inject it in you.

2714
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:35.460
It's really freaky.
Like this is some space age shit.

2715
02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:40.260
One shot and they shoot it in you within a week.

2716
02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:44.400
Within a week.
My shoulder fell amazing.
Really?
Yeah.
Now I'm five weeks in.

2717
02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:47.610
I keep waiting for it to hurt.
Like I'm doing all this working out.

2718
02:40:47.650 --> 02:40:51.300
I do doing rose and Chin ups and we keep waiting for it to fuck with me.

2719
02:40:51.301 --> 02:40:54.310
And it hasn't been fucking with me at all.
I was good back and he all this time,

2720
02:40:54.430 --> 02:40:55.890
everything's good,
man.
That's awesome.

2721
02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:58.920
I'm going to start shooting that stem cell shit everywhere.
Yeah.
Anything.

2722
02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:02.370
Anytime anything's wrong,
shoot it in there.
It's fucking see what's up.

2723
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:05.550
They're going to have,
within a few years,

2724
02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:09.450
they're going to have these places where you're going to be able to go and

2725
02:41:09.451 --> 02:41:12.810
they're going to put young blood in your body.
This is going to happen.

2726
02:41:12.811 --> 02:41:13.644
This is the next thing,

2727
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.730
because they've done all these studies that have shown with mice that when they

2728
02:41:17.731 --> 02:41:21.990
take young blood,
like the mice,
the young,
the blood of young mice,

2729
02:41:21.991 --> 02:41:25.710
and they put in the blood of old mice,
the mice,
their memory improves,

2730
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:29.070
their athleticism improves.
Their body starts moving like a young mouse.

2731
02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:32.700
And then when they take the blood of old mice and they put it in young mice,

2732
02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:36.960
the young mice become old and tired.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.

2733
02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:39.900
Fucking freaky.
Kind of amazing.
Someone was probably,

2734
02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:43.470
someone's gotta be doing that right now.
Dude in China guaranteed.

2735
02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:46.530
They probably have a bunch of fucking prisoners hooked up to machines and

2736
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:49.180
they're sucking blood out of them,
like the Matrix,
you know,

2737
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:53.430
and just pumping them right into their athletes.
Yeah.
They're also going to a,

2738
02:41:53.431 --> 02:41:55.980
they're doing these things called mio myostatin inhibitors.

2739
02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:58.260
And myostatin is what regulates your muscle size.

2740
02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:00.670
And they're doing that on Chinese athletes,
uh,

2741
02:42:00.730 --> 02:42:05.530
allegedly talking on that fuck with race when you have a billion people.
Yeah.

2742
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:08.950
Just like it was plenty of people,
Bro.
That's our number one resources.

2743
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.810
Humans experiment.
See how lucrative we can get.

2744
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:17.900
Get liquid right now.
I gotta go.
I gotta go pee.
Go Pee.
We'll wrap this up.

2745
02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:21.660
We've already done three hours.
Holy Shit.
You're a fucking animal.
Tommy buttons.

2746
02:42:21.661 --> 02:42:25.290
When's your a Netflix special?
You just,
you just recorded one.
When is it airing?

2747
02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:28.830
It's coming out in January.
It's coming out in January.
And then the last one,

2748
02:42:28.831 --> 02:42:31.250
which is hilarious.
Completely normal.
It's on Netflix now.

2749
02:42:31.290 --> 02:42:34.130
It's on Netflix right now.
Go take a peek.
You Fella.
Uh,

2750
02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:37.260
you could see Tommy Buns podcast.

2751
02:42:37.261 --> 02:42:41.220
It's called your mom's house with his lovely and talented wife,

2752
02:42:41.221 --> 02:42:45.360
Christina possessed ski.
You can catch Tommy on Twitter.

2753
02:42:45.390 --> 02:42:49.710
It's Tom Segura or on Instagram.
It's Segura Tom,

2754
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:54.690
cause I guess there's some other Sigora Tom Sigora character out there.

2755
02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:58.650
Um,
and he's fucking awesome.
If he's coming to your town,
go see him,

2756
02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:00.210
check out his website,
all that jazz,

2757
02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:05.570
all that stuff's available on his Instagram and his Facebook and his Twitter.

2758
02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:09.960
That's it.
Um,
all right.

2759
02:43:09.961 --> 02:43:13.570
You fucks will be back tomorrow.
So,
uh,

2760
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:16.900
tomorrow I'll see you then until then.
Be Nice to each other.

2761
02:43:16.901 --> 02:43:19.120
You've fucking savages.
Bye.

2762
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.260
<v 6>Okay.</v>
