00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you today by marijuana.</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>just start from the beginning.</v>

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that we know we,</v>

8
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>we think a lot of things on this podcast as well.</v>

9
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have our sponsors.</v>

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>We thank people like the coconut water people who are not really a sponsor</v>

12
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.343
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

13
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>who's not really a sponsor.</v>

14
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>But God it,</v>

15
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>we need to thank marijuana.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw you tweet that.</v>

22
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's so bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>have had the crappy coconut water.</v>

25
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>They always talk shit about coconut water.</v>

26
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Like why do you drink that?</v>

27
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to be like trendy like you have no,</v>

28
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

29
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I found out from my friend Edwin,</v>

31
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>he came into Jiu Jitsu class and we had,</v>

32
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

34
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we do a mostly no gauge Jujitsu,</v>

36
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then a guys decide to have like a Brazil night.</v>

37
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>So they put like gs on,</v>

38
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I brought coconut water and dude gave me a coconut water and I was like,</v>

39
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>well that was nice and you know,</v>

40
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I was like looking forward to this fucking watered down elephant load,</v>

41
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.471
<v Speaker 1>sort of a taste,</v>

42
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:16.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible taste and instead it was sweet and delicious.</v>

44
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.331
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

45
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck kind of coconut water is this.</v>

46
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>That's how I found out about two o like I kept the can and then went online and</v>

47
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>ordered it on Amazon and I was,</v>

48
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as it got there I was like,</v>

49
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>well let's see if this stuff is just like the stuff that he had.</v>

50
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.111
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

51
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>those cans are hardcore.</v>

52
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I bet that like,</v>

53
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

54
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>like when people go through trash and I find those,</v>

55
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:38.731
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

56
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>oh fucking jackpot.</v>

57
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.461
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's,</v>

58
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>these are worth like $2 or so.</v>

59
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It would be really good if the end of the world was coming and you wanted to</v>

60
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>make some sort of a can raft seal them all up together.</v>

61
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

62
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.403
<v Speaker 1>That would work.</v>

63
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>that's hardcore.</v>

65
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>there is so delicious.</v>

67
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>If you've never liked coconut water,</v>

68
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you need to try one of two things.</v>

69
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:57.421
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

70
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>fresh coconut water,</v>

71
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>coconut water that's not pasteurized with the already drilled and has a sticker</v>

72
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:03.781
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>

73
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And then just peel the sticker off and drink right from it.</v>

74
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

75
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>That is the best if you can get that,</v>

76
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>that is the best fit.</v>

77
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>But C two O is a close fucking second.</v>

78
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm writing,</v>

79
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>like especially when I'm,</v>

80
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:14.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

81
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm brainstorming in my office,</v>

82
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I got the little refrigerator right next to my desk.</v>

83
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink four or five of those bitches.</v>

84
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I got to get up to pee like every 40 minutes.</v>

85
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

86
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>But they're so good.</v>

87
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like it like it,</v>

88
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

89
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>when you're working out hard and you drink some coconut water,</v>

90
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>it feels like the best thing ever.</v>

91
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:29.934
<v Speaker 1>It feels,</v>

92
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Gatorade feels pretty good when you're tired,</v>

93
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:33.151
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

95
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you work out and like you need something,</v>

96
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.491
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

97
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>something that's a little more potent and just water.</v>

98
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Gatorade feels good,</v>

99
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but coconut water feels fucking amazing.</v>

100
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It's so delicious.</v>

101
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And you feel like you're a healthy savage out there drinking some tropical fruit</v>

102
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>

103
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you know Ha.</v>

104
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not even choose it's water.</v>

105
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

106
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

107
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

108
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Super good for you too.</v>

109
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

110
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>When you have the actual coconut though,</v>

111
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>cause then you get to kind of eat at the inside,</v>

112
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>like eat with a spoon.</v>

113
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>You know c two o just told me they're going to send me a new case that has pulp</v>

114
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

115
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.630
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

116
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like we had those from Amy and Brian's,</v>

117
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.734
<v Speaker 1>which I like him.</v>

118
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

119
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

120
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.091
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird,</v>

121
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:07.811
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing.</v>

122
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking something and there's like little chunky chewy things inside of</v>

123
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

124
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.101
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>

125
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like a goober.</v>

127
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

128
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

129
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

130
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.083
<v Speaker 1>It's coconut.</v>

131
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're getting a little chewy coconut.</v>

132
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a little fiber in the,</v>

133
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:20.711
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

135
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.660
<v Speaker 1>with the milk.</v>

136
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

139
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.261
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

140
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

141
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing though.</v>

142
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:25.541
<v Speaker 1>It's an acquired taste.</v>

143
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of us ever had chia seeds.</v>

144
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>The Chia drink,</v>

145
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.350
<v Speaker 1>like the stuff that makes the pet grow,</v>

146
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the you sprinkle on it,</v>

147
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:36.811
<v Speaker 1>she as well.</v>

148
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if there like somehow or another that was a drug?</v>

149
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>that is the case with a morning glory.</v>

152
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Seeds.</v>

153
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that morning glory seeds are like Super Psychedelic?</v>

154
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Apparently some of them are.</v>

155
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they've done something to some of the morning glory seeds that they</v>

156
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>sell in certain places.</v>

157
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful that they weren't chemically treated to kill the</v>

158
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive effect of them apparently.</v>

159
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you get like pure morning glory seeds,</v>

160
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>it has a very like LSD type effect to it.</v>

161
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty fucked up</v>

162
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

163
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I lose you.</v>

164
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking of how I was going to take,</v>

166
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I bring this into a fleshlight commercial where we're rolling,</v>

167
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.381
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

168
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to take off this logo off your face so they can see the</v>

169
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.630
<v Speaker 1>beautiful gyro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>don't even do that like that and the darkness.</v>

172
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>thanks to fucking make shit up.</v>

176
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

177
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

178
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.693
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

179
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess I could have a boner during this crazy.</v>

180
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's close strong with the flashlight,</v>

181
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

182
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

183
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>we have at [inaudible] dot com that's o and n I t just in a battle ropes and</v>

184
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>kettle bells is the newest products.</v>

185
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

186
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're familiar with anybody who's ever done like,</v>

187
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>any sort of mixed martial arts training,</v>

190
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>have you ever watched like the UFC countdown shows?</v>

191
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

192
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>two really popular methods of conditioning our kettle bells and a ropes.</v>

193
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I personally have never used the battle ropes and I'm looking forward to doing</v>

194
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:04.931
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

195
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a big proponent of kettle bells.</v>

196
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially the only way I lift weights these days.</v>

197
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.733
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it,</v>

198
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.131
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

199
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>it gives me like what what it is.</v>

201
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>If you've never seen him before,</v>

202
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a bowling ball with a handle on it.</v>

203
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant ball of lead and you know,</v>

204
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you can get them as light as 10 pounds and you can get him,</v>

205
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.114
<v Speaker 1>heavy up,</v>

207
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>know you get 70 pounders in night.</v>

208
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes can throw around like 120 pounders,</v>

209
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:30.101
<v Speaker 1>like big,</v>

210
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:30.401
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>

211
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.234
<v Speaker 1>crazy dudes.</v>

212
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

213
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>really unnecessary though.</v>

214
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get a great workout,</v>

215
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>you can get a great workout with a 35 pound kettle bell.</v>

216
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous,</v>

217
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>but there are some,</v>

218
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.031
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

219
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>which are sold out now because we've been talking about them on the podcast.</v>

220
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

221
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't get that.</v>

222
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Tried buying those videos that we talked about,</v>

223
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>the extreme kettlebell cardio workout dudes are texting me saying that they're</v>

224
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>sold out everywhere now,</v>

225
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>so I'm glad because a,</v>

226
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good product and I make no money from that.</v>

227
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I just want to let you know,</v>

228
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>just letting people know the fuck is good.</v>

229
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I think I just got shocked.</v>

230
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I think you did too.</v>

231
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I saw you move funny thought.</v>

232
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a spider bite and you're going to turn into a fucking spider man.</v>

233
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was some sort of viral marketing.</v>

234
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

235
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a news places hot?</v>

236
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.201
<v Speaker 1>It's not hot.</v>

237
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:13.461
<v Speaker 1>Haunted,</v>

238
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:13.701
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

239
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>We got issues.</v>

240
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Just got shocked.</v>

241
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be okay,</v>

242
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.993
<v Speaker 1>Sweetie.</v>

243
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

244
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>on a.com go check it out.</v>

245
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I took my three Alpha brains right before the show.</v>

246
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.550
<v Speaker 1>What is Alpha Brain Joe?</v>

247
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>It is a cognitive enhancing supplement.</v>

248
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

249
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's called the new tropic.</v>

250
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:27.531
<v Speaker 1>What they,</v>

251
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>ours are essentially nutrients.</v>

252
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to increase your brain's ability to produce,</v>

253
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>to produce neurotransmitters.</v>

254
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Now that coming out of my mouth is just really a bunch of noise because I'm way</v>

255
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>too fucking stupid to understand the science behind any of that.</v>

256
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully,</v>

257
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>there've been some really intelligent people that have sort of deciphered it.</v>

258
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>If you go to [inaudible] dot com there is a link where you can get to see the</v>

259
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>science behind on it and the science behind nootropics and I suggested if you're</v>

260
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>interested in any sort of vitamin or supplement or anything that you get to put</v>

261
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.621
<v Speaker 1>into your body,</v>

262
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you should do a little research on it.</v>

263
00:06:58.971 --> 00:06:59.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to do that,</v>

265
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'd just like to take things,</v>

266
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

267
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of research pro and con about nootropics and about even vitamins.</v>

268
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I am a very strong believer in health and nutrition and vitamins.</v>

269
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really strong believer in eating really good food,</v>

270
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but I also believe that you help your body with nutrients.</v>

271
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I've had personal health issues that I've helped with vitamins.</v>

272
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I know they have a positive effect on your body.</v>

273
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

274
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to just be careful about what you take into your body on a</v>

275
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>

276
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And if you're interested in any sort of a nootropic formula,</v>

277
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's on it,</v>

278
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279

281
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>people put together online.</v>

282

292
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 1>That's how confident we are first of all in the product and how much we really</v>

293
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure that nobody feels like they're getting ripped off.</v>

294
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.653

436
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.951
<v Speaker 1>Use a code name,</v>

437
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and it save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy for men.</v>

438
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.241
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

439
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.074
<v Speaker 1>Bitches</v>

440
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and just when you thought it was impossible to do that commercial.</v>

441
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:24.694
<v Speaker 1>A definitely</v>

442
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.183
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

443
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett,</v>

444
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett is one of those old school savages that will actually try to drive</v>

445
00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:45.380
<v Speaker 1>a 1969 Oldsmobile.</v>

446
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.880
<v Speaker 1>He liked drives that shit.</v>

447
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a regular car.</v>

448
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Like he actually gets on the highway is like I'm going to go somewhere and my</v>

449
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:53.480
<v Speaker 1>1969 automobile,</v>

450
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.520
<v Speaker 1>so his crazy ass drove all the way from Orange County on the four oh five which</v>

451
00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:01.340
<v Speaker 1>is stopped dead like a parking lot 90% of the time.</v>

452
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.533
<v Speaker 1>So he dropped.</v>

453
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a big exaggeration.</v>

454
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not even 50% of the time,</v>

455
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 1>but when it stopped dead,</v>

456
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a mother fucker.</v>

457
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It is a motherfucker.</v>

458
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to wrap your head around how long it's gonna take you.</v>

459
00:13:14.031 --> 00:13:14.721
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you look,</v>

460
00:13:14.721 --> 00:13:19.721
<v Speaker 1>there's like is your five or six lanes on each side and some spots at least five</v>

461
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.480
<v Speaker 1>at least five maybe six lanes on each side.</v>

462
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And when I am talking about there's no room,</v>

463
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just all car for miles.</v>

464
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no space in between the cars,</v>

465
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.901
<v Speaker 1>all the cards.</v>

466
00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So even if they started at the beginning,</v>

467
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 1>they started the front of the line and that guy moves ahead and the next guy</v>

468
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Speaker 1>moves behind him and they all pick up speed.</v>

469
00:13:41.811 --> 00:13:42.644
<v Speaker 1>The highway speed.</v>

470
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.940
<v Speaker 1>You're there for a fucking hour,</v>

471
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

472
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.171
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just,</v>

473
00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 1>just getting these cars to move is insane.</v>

474
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It gives you this sense of futility.</v>

475
00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

476
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.621
<v Speaker 1>you look at it,</v>

477
00:13:51.621 --> 00:13:51.861
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

478
00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:53.310
<v Speaker 1>these numbers are impossible.</v>

479
00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

480
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.460
<v Speaker 1>is anybody monitoring these numbers?</v>

481
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.220
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they get completely untenable?</v>

482
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.170
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they're just unmanageable?</v>

483
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.050
<v Speaker 1>What happens when it's just so beyond belief?</v>

484
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.250
<v Speaker 1>When there's so many cars,</v>

485
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Speaker 1>no one can move anywhere.</v>

486
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Do we?</v>

487
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.973
<v Speaker 1>What do we do then?</v>

488
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.803
<v Speaker 1>We fly.</v>

489
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what we don't do.</v>

490
00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:12.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't drive 1969 Oldsmobiles on the highway.</v>

491
00:14:12.681 --> 00:14:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Like they're real cars.</v>

492
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>

493
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Having so much fun with my card.</v>

494
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I haven't owned a car that I've enjoyed for a very long time.</v>

495
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.691
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

496
00:14:20.691 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>like I now enjoy like,</v>

497
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.250
<v Speaker 1>like flying around in my car.</v>

498
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

500
00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:28.220
<v Speaker 1>when you get used to a nimble car that can move around.</v>

501
00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:29.300
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this earlier,</v>

502
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.240
<v Speaker 1>like about how old cars are.</v>

503
00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

504
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

505
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I was actually talking about it with the staff that old cars,</v>

506
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.300
<v Speaker 1>like when you see like a 1969,</v>

507
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.790
<v Speaker 1>like a corvette or something like that,</v>

508
00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that's like a work of art made by a bunch of people in a factory.</v>

509
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:44.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

510
00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 1>they put that thing together and they screwed those bolts in place and they made</v>

511
00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 1>that thing and it has like this work of art,</v>

512
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of a quality to it that makes it really cool.</v>

513
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>But those things drive like shit.</v>

514
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Those things are ridiculously bad.</v>

515
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>They did not balanced right.</v>

516
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 1>They go out corners all fucked up like old muscle cars or the dopiest fucking</v>

517
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>things to drive ever.</v>

518
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>The really dangerous for the most part,</v>

519
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 1>unless you've completely up upgraded their breaks,</v>

520
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.361
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

521
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to bill burr.</v>

522
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Bill burr has like a 1950 pickup truck.</v>

523
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

524
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

525
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

526
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it's sounds awesome.</v>

527
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like he opened the hood that you could climb in there with the engine and</v>

528
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Polish it with a toothbrush.</v>

529
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

530
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>it's so big and the whole thing is just ridiculous.</v>

531
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.951
<v Speaker 3>Get it.</v>

532
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

533
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 3>you can actually think like,</v>

534
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:29.751
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

535
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 3>I could actually work on this car if I had to.</v>

536
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

537
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 3>I worked on my car growing,</v>

538
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 3>my dad made me work on cars growing up and I actually could see like,</v>

539
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:37.191
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

540
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 3>that's the engine.</v>

541
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:38.781
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

542

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

674
00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be careful about that because a lot of people in Vegas or from old</v>

675
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 1>school Vegas,</v>

676
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.410
<v Speaker 1>if you ever fear and loathing in Las Vegas,</v>

677
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 1>classic work of my favorite author,</v>

678
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.013
<v Speaker 1>a Hunter Thompson,</v>

679
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.621
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

680
00:18:58.621 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

681
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 1>had that whole thing about,</v>

682
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 1>they were on their way to Barstow when the drugs began to take hold.</v>

683
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking great.</v>

684
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>But that Vegas of like fear and everything was illegal and if you got caught</v>

685
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:10.261
<v Speaker 1>with pot,</v>

686
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you would do life in jail.</v>

687
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:11.881
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

688
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 1>if they pulled you over for pot,</v>

689
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you could do 20 fucking years and that's not bullshit.</v>

690
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably a lot of people who did.</v>

691
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Probably a lot of kids who got high in California,</v>

692
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 1>drove on the way to Vegas and got arrested and spent years in jail.</v>

693
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really scary.</v>

694
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>It's scary to stop and think about that.</v>

695
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And the people that are running a lot of those casinos,</v>

696
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.961
<v Speaker 1>those guys had been,</v>

697
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>well I started out in the dunes and 69 and then I moved over to those fucking</v>

698
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>old school guys.</v>

699
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't fuck around man.</v>

700
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't be thinking that you're going to light up joints and one of those</v>

701
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 1>local casinos,</v>

706
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why you just drink heavily and make really bad decisions and you</v>

707
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 1>don't remember anything and it stays there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

725
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you might be the exact opposite.</v>

726
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You might be a liability in my dig a hole for you out there and the fuck I</v>

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.981

730
00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:24.141

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:24.871
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

733
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they're,</v>

734
00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:26.581
<v Speaker 1>Doug should,</v>

735
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

736
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.740
<v Speaker 1>encourage anybody to spark up.</v>

737
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think of that.</v>

738
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:29.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

739
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

740
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to be in watch this places we can get away with that.</v>

741
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm the most places.</v>

742
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:34.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

743
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>especially with Doug knows that like,</v>

744
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of you can't,</v>

745
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't smoke a cigarette in a theater.</v>

746
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

747
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 1>And the same reason why you can't smoke a joint,</v>

748
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.780
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want you lighting something on fire.</v>

749
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:44.221
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid.</v>

750
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:44.491
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

751
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:45.324
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust you.</v>

752
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Who knows who's got like pure in there,</v>

753
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking,</v>

755
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.370
<v Speaker 1>they're soda bottle and they spill it and then someone drops a lighter on it and</v>

756
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 1>we're fuck.</v>

757
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 1>And it was a blazing fire inside the comedy club.</v>

758
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:57.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

759
00:20:57.971 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 1>you can guarantee you that's not going to happen.</v>

760
00:20:59.530 --> 00:20:59.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

761
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:00.341
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

762
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Anything you shouldn't introduce fire into a room packed with people,</v>

763
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

764
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't believe in candles.</v>

765
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 1>So I love these little things that you've done,</v>

766
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 1>these little pods there.</v>

767
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 1>You got some little little sweet jammies that Brian has and he's got these</v>

768
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Speaker 1>little pods all around the,</v>

769
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:14.981
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

770
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the room where they,</v>

771
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.374
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.100
<v Speaker 1>they recharge their little batteries in there and they have different colors and</v>

773
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>they're almost impossible to turn off,</v>

774
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>which really frustrates me.</v>

775
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 1>How do you look at them to change color?</v>

776
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just moving them around.</v>

777
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.010
<v Speaker 1>There's no rhyme or reason and the directions,</v>

778
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>the directions are purposely insane.</v>

779
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't have anything to do with the product at all.</v>

780
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think they just do it to fuck with you because you're like,</v>

781
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 1>anyone that buys these,</v>

782
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to trip out anyway.</v>

783
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 1>We got to think who would buy this?</v>

784
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 1>If I was the government,</v>

785
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what I would do.</v>

786
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I would take the first like gps tracking devices that we distribute out there</v>

787
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>into the world and a target stoners.</v>

788
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So lava lamps,</v>

789
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I would arm those and these fucking silly lights,</v>

790
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I would only go after the stoners.</v>

791
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>They need some lava lamp technology.</v>

792
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.820
<v Speaker 1>They need to put like LCD screens inside the lava.</v>

793
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And then so like when you're watching a lava lamp,</v>

794
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just like warp TVs or something like that.</v>

795
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.141
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

796
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it was like the liquid was like a TV screen at a game.</v>

797
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 1>You could have like that technology.</v>

798
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>That would be annoying.</v>

799
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:19.024
<v Speaker 1>That'd be weird.</v>

800
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 1>But you can have it tuned in to anything.</v>

801
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

802
00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:21.191
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

803
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:21.791
<v Speaker 1>It'd be cool.</v>

804
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>It'd be cool for a wall effect.</v>

805
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool if you projected it on a wall,</v>

806
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:26.771
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

807
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

808
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:27.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.843
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

810
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Most like rave clubs.</v>

811
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.793
<v Speaker 1>Well they fake it.</v>

812
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>They really present project an actual lava lamp.</v>

813
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.910
<v Speaker 1>They project a video of a lava lamp.</v>

814
00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's all video,</v>

815
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:39.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

817
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually project the lava lamp itself.</v>

818
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 1>What exactly?</v>

819
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been to that Rehab though?</v>

820
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to one of those parties?</v>

821
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

822
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe long time ago,</v>

823
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

824
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:51.881
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

825
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

826
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.601
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

827
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>those things are fun man.</v>

828
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.020
<v Speaker 1>But you can get Sun burnt and you get fucking drunk out there and uh,</v>

829
00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it got to be careful they'll fall in and drown.</v>

830
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

831
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Just look at this though.</v>

832
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

833
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you gotta wonder how many people are paying in that water because it's not,</v>

834
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not just one.</v>

835
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit though.</v>

836
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 1>This is like spring break.</v>

837
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

838
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

839
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's just insane.</v>

840
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And Vegas is on another level.</v>

841
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It is on another level of democracy.</v>

842
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.020
<v Speaker 1>People are just tightly wound and Vegas is the one place where it's okay to make</v>

843
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>out with your girlfriend,</v>

844
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

845
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and girls start making out with each other for the first time and look at that.</v>

846
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:28.931
<v Speaker 1>See right there.</v>

847
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Right on cue.</v>

848
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.023
<v Speaker 1>Was it a shame?</v>

849
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Well just you going to get a little of that now and then while these girls are</v>

850
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>grinding on each other and grinding and that's a podcasting here,</v>

851
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that would be good.</v>

852
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those are our people.</v>

853
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.850
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>

854
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way they would work is if everyone here just branched off and</v>

855
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 1>fucked and got this out of your system.</v>

856
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can put on a podcast with so much slinging Dick and pussy all</v>

857
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:56.440
<v Speaker 1>over the place as you look how,</v>

858
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.800
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna give a fuck about anything?</v>

859
00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:58.634
<v Speaker 1>We have to say,</v>

860
00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking about,</v>

861
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I can fuck her.</v>

862
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I think she wants to fuck,</v>

863
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:03.231
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>

864
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to fuck me.</v>

865
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

866
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Should I let him fuck me.</v>

867
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you're doing shots together.</v>

868
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know it,</v>

869
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 1>we're floating the river thing.</v>

870
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

871
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you got to fuck.</v>

872
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Get that shit out of your system.</v>

873
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:18.671
<v Speaker 1>Then come down and listen to US assholes rant because you're not going to be</v>

874
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:19.634
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

875
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be interested in what?</v>

876
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Anything that we have to say.</v>

877
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

878
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 1>there's so much pussy everywhere.</v>

879
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.371
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

880
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 1>If this,</v>

881
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 1>this is what Arabs hate us,</v>

882
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

883
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Videos like this.</v>

884
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Videos like this get out and they don't even let chicks where they're fucking</v>

885
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 1>regular dresses.</v>

886
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to wear burqas and shit.</v>

887
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

888
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalists,</v>

889
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>they look at this as this is the downfall of western civilization.</v>

890
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>This is Babylon to them.</v>

891
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 1>of course it's all ridiculous.</v>

893
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:43.701
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

894
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:44.534
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>completely hypocritical for the most part.</v>

896
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:47.241
<v Speaker 1>And the guys,</v>

897
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 1>even the guys that were on the planes that flew into the twin towers,</v>

898
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 1>those guys were at strip clubs like a couple of nights before.</v>

899
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

900
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.900
<v Speaker 1>this is what they point to.</v>

901
00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>If you want to talk to the decline of Western civilization,</v>

902
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 1>they point to all this undisciplined life.</v>

903
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>What they don't understand is they live in a place where you have to be strict</v>

904
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>and disciplined.</v>

905
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You live in a fucking shitty desert.</v>

906
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

907
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 1>if you live in a terrible,</v>

908
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>terrible environment and you know,</v>

909
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 1>and everyone is like really strict and really harsh and mean,</v>

910
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 1>that's because the environment,</v>

911
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:20.931
<v Speaker 1>you live in socks,</v>

912
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 1>no one can relax.</v>

913
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 1>So the only people that survive are the people that are like super hardcore.</v>

914
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If the road ends,</v>

915
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Vegas would be safer than la though,</v>

916
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:29.984
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

917
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I know,</v>

918
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I know there's no water or anything really there.</v>

919
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>

920
00:25:33.811 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>It was lake mead.</v>

921
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

922
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a big lake there.</v>

923
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fake lake though.</v>

924
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an artificial lake.</v>

925
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it might have been built by a dam or something like that.</v>

926
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's there.</v>

927
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

928
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's awesome and they have a striped bass in there.</v>

929
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.180
<v Speaker 1>You could go fishing in there.</v>

930
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:48.771
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

931
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I think Vegas is probably safer than La.</v>

932
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they would if they were attacking America,</v>

933
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 1>they want attack our banking system.</v>

934
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.220
<v Speaker 1>If someone was trying to be a terrorist,</v>

935
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.830
<v Speaker 1>they would try to attack massive population centers.</v>

936
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Vegas for all its craziness,</v>

937
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really have that many people live in there.</v>

938
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly small town.</v>

939
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It'd be easy to escape.</v>

940
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

941
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 1>just once,</v>

942
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>if the shit hits the fan,</v>

943
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the resources are going to run dry really quick.</v>

944
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to bring in any food.</v>

945
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

946
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 1>what are you eating when you eat?</v>

947
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.421
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>

948
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:18.231
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be like,</v>

949
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 1>it really should be,</v>

950
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>which is a desert and not,</v>

951
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with living in the desert,</v>

952
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just the only way to live in the desert today and this and this world is</v>

953
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to have modern power.</v>

954
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to have food,</v>

955
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to have supermarkets.</v>

956
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to get water that that has to come to you if you live in the</v>

957
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:36.740
<v Speaker 1>desert because it was just you live in the desert,</v>

958
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:37.574
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fucked.</v>

959
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>There's no food out there.</v>

960
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to grow food?</v>

961
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat,</v>

962
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.601
<v Speaker 1>there's no water.</v>

963
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

964
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're bringing in,</v>

965
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't really live in the desert.</v>

966
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:50.190
<v Speaker 1>So the only way to live in the desert is with modern means and when the shit</v>

967
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:51.024
<v Speaker 1>hits the fan,</v>

968
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 1>if you're living in the desert,</v>

969
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 1>those modern means would be useless and then you've got to get the fuck out of</v>

970
00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:55.591
<v Speaker 1>the desert.</v>

971
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:56.424
<v Speaker 1>So probably the most,</v>

972
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 1>probably the best places.</v>

973
00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Then it would be something like,</v>

974
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

976
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>not bad,</v>

977
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.061
<v Speaker 1>not bad,</v>

978
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but the winter is a problem.</v>

979
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Transportation is a real cunt.</v>

980
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to ride horses back and forth everywhere.</v>

981
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to get around and you don't want to go too far on a fucking</v>

982
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

983
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want to do that.</v>

984
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go too far.</v>

985
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 1>If you have to drag shit,</v>

986
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 1>if the horses have to drag lumber and stuff,</v>

987
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be,</v>

988
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to be as self sustaining as possible,</v>

989
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but we'll have dogs and I will have it slaves and dogs,</v>

990
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.551
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like that.</v>

991
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Say it doesn't get that snow.</v>

992
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 1>You can count on it to be that snowy.</v>

993
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.013
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

994
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

995
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Like reindeers just tons of chick.</v>

996
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>All those Chihuahuas,</v>

997
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.480
<v Speaker 1>they will all be put to use as horses now.</v>

998
00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 1>They would be trained,</v>

999
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>they trample on each other and we would hate them if we find out how mean they</v>

1000
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 1>really are the deep biting the ones underneath them as they're trying to pull</v>

1001
00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:43.224
<v Speaker 1>your sled.</v>

1002
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I was watching old looney tunes this weekend cause this guy named fast.</v>

1003
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Eddie told me that.</v>

1004
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.091
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1005
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1006
00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.571
<v Speaker 1>do you remember,</v>

1007
00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:48.991
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1008
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:49.381
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1009
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1010
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.071
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1011

1013
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.550

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1016
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's,</v>

1017
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.870
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy makes you call them fast Eddie.</v>

1018
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Which my name Beth Daddy.</v>

1019
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 1>They call me fast at this one.</v>

1020
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Fast Eddie or right and it's fast.</v>

1021
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fell sin from the fucking hustler.</v>

1022
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It's Paul fucking Newman.</v>

1023
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.953
<v Speaker 1>That's who it was.</v>

1024
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 1>The guy that originally.</v>

1025
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.271
<v Speaker 1>That's fast.</v>

1026
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:12.511
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

1027
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't call yourself fast setting.</v>

1028
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 1>That's completely,</v>

1029
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy from the comedy store.</v>

1030
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who a Hispanic guy?</v>

1031
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1032
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but he can't call himself fast.</v>

1033
00:28:20.471 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 1>That if somebody else wants to call caused himself.</v>

1034
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.061
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1035
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you better be able to play pool.</v>

1036
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

1037
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 1>You want to call yourself fast?</v>

1038
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he calls himself.</v>

1039
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.194
<v Speaker 1>I think other people can,</v>

1040
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but they better stop this one fast.</v>

1041
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fast.</v>

1042
00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:32.544
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fell son.</v>

1043
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>What was I talking about?</v>

1044
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Paul Newman.</v>

1045
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.681
<v Speaker 1>The Hustler.</v>

1046
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Gleason.</v>

1047
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Now that's what you're talking about,</v>

1048
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:37.561
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1049
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:37.921
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

1050
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 63,</v>

1051
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what year it was,</v>

1052
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.060
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in 1960s,</v>

1053
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.051
<v Speaker 1>early sixties.</v>

1054
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:43.621
<v Speaker 1>But God,</v>

1055
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 1>what a movie man.</v>

1056
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 1>What a great fucking movie.</v>

1057
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a pool player that's like,</v>

1058
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you know that movies like the holy grail of movies.</v>

1059
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Speaker 1>This is the holy grail of pool movies cause it was like a really good dramatic</v>

1060
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 1>film and it captured this guy's obsession to be the best pool player.</v>

1061
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Although quite honestly,</v>

1062
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Paul Newman really does not have a very believable stroke.</v>

1063
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 1>He needed to stay down on the ball a little bit more.</v>

1064
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 1>His fall through it was a little ham fisted,</v>

1065
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>whereas Jackie Gleason had a real stroke.</v>

1066
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Gleason could actually run a hundred balls,</v>

1067
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1068
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I believe you at least ran 75 balls.</v>

1069
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1070
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 1>he was a real player.</v>

1071
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 1>You could tell by the way he would a pocket balls like he was.</v>

1072
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.853
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1073
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.640
<v Speaker 1>he grew up on pool tables here.</v>

1074
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Andy Griffin died today.</v>

1075
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Andy Griffin from the Andy Griffith show.</v>

1076
00:29:27.401 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh that sucks.</v>

1078
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:29.881
<v Speaker 1>It does suck.</v>

1079
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of those.</v>

1080
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Aw Yeah.</v>

1081
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.491
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't.</v>

1083
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody hated that guy is fucking nice guy.</v>

1084
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 1>He's already buried that he'd died today and he's already buried.</v>

1085
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1086
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Because he wanted an immediate burial.</v>

1087
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1088
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 1>he probably didn't want to be embalmed or something.</v>

1089
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.161
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

1091
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Can you say that you're wanting to bond?</v>

1092
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Just put a bunch of craziness.</v>

1093
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Is this the universe eats our bodies.</v>

1094
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.071
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1095
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:51.881
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is.</v>

1096
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:52.541
<v Speaker 1>It's set up.</v>

1097
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of shit inside the soil.</v>

1098
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 1>The soil is not just dirt.</v>

1099
00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Soil is alive.</v>

1100
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 1>It's alive with minerals.</v>

1101
00:29:58.121 --> 00:29:59.250
<v Speaker 1>It's alive with organisms.</v>

1102
00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.811
<v Speaker 1>Just attention is it?</v>

1103
00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>The 10 people acts as a bunch of shit in there that would eat your body and</v>

1104
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's supposed to do and you poison that stuff.</v>

1105
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1106
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 1>poisoned your bodies and then cover them with makeup.</v>

1107
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:09.151
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1108
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:10.080
<v Speaker 1>So people can stare.</v>

1109
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Number 10 you're not dead.</v>

1110
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have a dead person with fucking makeup on?</v>

1111
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Lying in a bed with a rosary wrapped around their frozen frigid hands.</v>

1112
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Just bury them.</v>

1113
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 1>This is craziness.</v>

1114
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Staring at a body doesn't do anybody any good.</v>

1115
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 1>What if we totally missed guests?</v>

1116
00:30:26.711 --> 00:30:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Like how old they are,</v>

1117
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the planet is and that actually every,</v>

1118
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 1>all the dirt is just tons of tons of dead people from like billions and billions</v>

1119
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

1120
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.140
<v Speaker 1>And like in the middle there just one person and that's God and he's just</v>

1121
00:30:37.141 --> 00:30:37.661
<v Speaker 1>sitting there like,</v>

1122
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1123
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1124
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:39.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of funny because that's what like some,</v>

1126
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.380
<v Speaker 1>there's some beaches that are covered in fish bones.</v>

1127
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Like the sand is actually like fish bones,</v>

1128
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:48.611
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1129
00:30:48.611 --> 00:30:49.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1130
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 1>where they have big die offs.</v>

1131
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that solve the seat?</v>

1132
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1133
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.921
<v Speaker 1>the salt and sea.</v>

1134
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1135
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 1>There's areas I haven't,</v>

1136

1137
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to that shit.</v>

1138
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 1>We talked about doing a podcast.</v>

1139
00:30:59.561 --> 00:30:59.891
<v Speaker 1>There are whites,</v>

1140
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.080
<v Speaker 1>but we like sobered up.</v>

1141
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many people since then that,</v>

1142
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 1>cause now that I know what it is that talk about it,</v>

1143
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:06.191
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1144
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:07.024
<v Speaker 1>oh I went there.</v>

1145
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.873
<v Speaker 1>What was it like?</v>

1146
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1147
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's stinks.</v>

1148
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1149
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I recommend it.</v>

1150
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.591
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

1151
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird,</v>

1152
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1153
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.241

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1249
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.300
<v Speaker 1>a special documentary.</v>

1250
00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:23.301
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because this area in our lifetime went from being this</v>

1251
00:33:24.601 --> 00:33:29.601
<v Speaker 1>amazing resort were everybody went to party to being a complete mess.</v>

1252
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Everybody moved out.</v>

1253
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the apocalypse man.</v>

1254
00:33:33.271 --> 00:33:34.740
<v Speaker 1>The video is insane.</v>

1255
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at what it used to be like,</v>

1256
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like driving around there,</v>

1257
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.960
<v Speaker 1>their motorboats and catching fish and they were all drinking and partying.</v>

1258
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It was like some crazy like resort.</v>

1259
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.520
<v Speaker 1>We're like Sonny Bono grew up and he was a part of this big movement to try to</v>

1260
00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:54.240
<v Speaker 1>bring it back and then you see what it became and you realize that that can</v>

1261
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:57.630
<v Speaker 1>happen inside our lifetime from fucking Sonny Bono.</v>

1262
00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.790
<v Speaker 1>The Sonny and Cher show was on when I was a kid.</v>

1263
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Sonny Bono died when he went skiing into a fucking tray.</v>

1264
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.201
<v Speaker 1>I was sad.</v>

1265
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Sonny Bono seemed like a nice guy,</v>

1266
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and from that era,</v>

1267
00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:09.840
<v Speaker 1>from his life till now apocalypse,</v>

1268
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is just dead fish.</v>

1269
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So much dead fish that the sand is bones.</v>

1270
00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:17.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1271
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:17.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1272
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1273
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.350
<v Speaker 1>a boney,</v>

1274
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.970
<v Speaker 1>crunchy sand.</v>

1275
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>The whole place just stinks of dead death.</v>

1276
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.080
<v Speaker 1>They have massive,</v>

1277
00:34:25.081 --> 00:34:27.870
<v Speaker 1>massive fish die offs were like a million fish will die.</v>

1278
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.183
<v Speaker 1>And they just,</v>

1280
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they flood like the inland areas.</v>

1281
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So like all the boats of rotten fish around them.</v>

1282
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's like a bucket of dead pussies,</v>

1283
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
00:34:36.451 --> 00:34:37.710
<v Speaker 1>like just like that bad.</v>

1285
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.491
<v Speaker 1>Or if it's just like,</v>

1286
00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:38.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1287
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:39.451
<v Speaker 1>like fishy,</v>

1288
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:40.000
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

1289
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.140
<v Speaker 1>death is probably the most depressing smell ever.</v>

1291
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could be happy smelling a million dead fish.</v>

1292
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like nature's letting you know there's a terrible thing here.</v>

1293
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:50.250
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>

1294
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever's going on here.</v>

1295
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.560
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>

1296
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's led us a million organisms to shit out and just stop existing</v>

1297
00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

1298
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.053
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

1299
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.433
<v Speaker 1>But it looks,</v>

1301
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.850
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it used to be awesome.</v>

1302
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:03.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1303
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy to watch.</v>

1304
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it used to be this bad ass place and everybody would go to and you</v>

1305
00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:07.921
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1306
00:35:07.921 --> 00:35:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to get your party on w and in our lifetime it's become a nightmare.</v>

1307
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And in this documentary though,</v>

1308
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.400
<v Speaker 1>some dudes sates,</v>

1309
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.950
<v Speaker 1>not some dude say it's all hype.</v>

1310
00:35:16.951 --> 00:35:19.770
<v Speaker 1>And one guy was in the documentary that actually eats the fish.</v>

1311
00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:21.270
<v Speaker 1>He eats it like Sashimi.</v>

1312
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.320
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even cook it.</v>

1313
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It just filets it.</v>

1314
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.511
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1315
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:25.344
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1316
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.800
<v Speaker 1>But maybe as bodies just like so used to that maybe he's like,</v>

1317
00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:29.461
<v Speaker 1>while he's doing that,</v>

1318
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 1>he's got three cigarettes in his mouth at the same time,</v>

1319
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.260
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck about some fucking pollution.</v>

1320
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1321
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1322
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you really think about what if you're a cigarette smoker should be you</v>

1323
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:40.520
<v Speaker 1>be even concerned about pollution.</v>

1324
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it could be possibly as bad as shit your self inflicting.</v>

1325
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1326
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you're voluntarily pumping that shit in your system.</v>

1327
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Eat some dirty Shashimi what are you worried about?</v>

1328
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking I'm done with Sushi and just don't be getting sick.</v>

1329
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 1>That last time really scared me out away from it.</v>

1330
00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you can really fuck your system up if you get a parasite and they say</v>

1331
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to be really careful,</v>

1332
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 1>you should only eat salt water Sushi.</v>

1333
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You should only eat like tuna.</v>

1334
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And you've gotta be careful with freshwater stuff cause freshwater stuff can</v>

1335
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>contain parasites.</v>

1336
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1337
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1338
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1339
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you really should cook a lot of freshwater fishes.</v>

1340
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1341
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 1>There's certain fish that have parasites,</v>

1342
00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:18.560
<v Speaker 1>like salmon,</v>

1343
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 1>have parasites.</v>

1344
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.041
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

1345
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful and you can get,</v>

1346
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.801
<v Speaker 1>you can get sick,</v>

1347
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:23.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1348
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.700
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1349
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1350
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you could fuck up your digestive tract,</v>

1352
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

1354
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just not good to have little fucking parasites inside your body.</v>

1355
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Contouring it up.</v>

1356
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You've really got to see Ted Mann.</v>

1357
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 1>That was a really,</v>

1358
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 1>really good fun movie.</v>

1359
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you're like family guy,</v>

1360
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1361
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.230
<v Speaker 1>it feels good.</v>

1362
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:40.710
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1363
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I like how you used a lot of the characters in family guy,</v>

1364
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but the actor parts,</v>

1365
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:44.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1366
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 1>like they're real,</v>

1367
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 1>they're real people or actors in the movie.</v>

1368
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So everything just feels comfortable.</v>

1369
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:50.371
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

1370
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of drug use like mushrooms and weed in it.</v>

1371
00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:53.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1372
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 1>when I heard that that movie did good,</v>

1373
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1374
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

1375
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:56.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1376
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.950
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1377
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.660
<v Speaker 1>a good guy one.</v>

1378
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:36:59.070 --> 00:36:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1380
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Like Seth Macfarlane is,</v>

1381
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1382
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I only met him once.</v>

1383
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I did a an episode of,</v>

1384
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:04.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1385
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that someone was on fear factor or something like that on a show.</v>

1386
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And I did it on a [inaudible] and then they made fun of me and American Dad too,</v>

1387
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.483
<v Speaker 1>so that was kind of cool.</v>

1388
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

1389
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't tweaked people tweet to get them on a podcast or something.</v>

1390
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's busy as fuck now that it's movies gigantic now his movie took off,</v>

1391
00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1392
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a genuinely nice dude.</v>

1393
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:22.291
<v Speaker 1>Like when I met him,</v>

1394
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:22.981
<v Speaker 1>he was like genuine.</v>

1395
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you can tell when someone's like,</v>

1396
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 1>here's a genuine smile,</v>

1397
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:26.580
<v Speaker 1>like a friendly dude.</v>

1398
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's nice when you know,</v>

1399
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you find out he's doing well,</v>

1400
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell fucking Delta of south park guys hate him now.</v>

1401
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:33.920

<v Speaker 1>They shit on him.</v>

1403
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.633
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

1404
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting out competitive.</v>

1405
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.041
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

1406
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1407
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they hate him.</v>

1408
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:40.680

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.553
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1442
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You want to kill the podcast and try to figure out what's going on.</v>

1443
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Sparked my face.</v>

1444
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:29.424
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the spark,</v>

1445
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1446
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 1>this day seems to be cursed.</v>

1447
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1448
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that the podcast started at least a little late because we would have</v>

1449
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 1>been stumbling idiots.</v>

1450
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We got ahold of some pot that is from another planet,</v>

1451
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 1>as Joey Diaz would say,</v>

1452
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 1>is they shit they gave Kennedy before they took the top off the convertible.</v>

1453
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1454
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1455
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to die?</v>

1456
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It's sparked like light just to the podcast from over there.</v>

1457
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.263
<v Speaker 1>You'll be good.</v>

1458
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1459
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.540
<v Speaker 1>we have a serious shortage and throw some water on.</v>

1460
00:38:58.541 --> 00:38:59.374
<v Speaker 1>It will be fine.</v>

1461
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 1>That was a white lightning bolt,</v>

1462
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 1>bolt spark.</v>

1463
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That's God.</v>

1464
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Or Fuck,</v>

1465
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you've been,</v>

1466
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you've been taught that God for your whole life.</v>

1467
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.750
<v Speaker 1>God is upset.</v>

1468
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.451
<v Speaker 1>God's upset with you,</v>

1469
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:11.284
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

1470
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 1>All right folks,</v>

1471
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to figure out what this is.</v>

1472
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 1>So Brian doesn't die and we don't want Josh Barnett to have a flat tire and then</v>

1473
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:19.564
<v Speaker 1>get electrocuted.</v>

1474
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 1>That shit would be ridiculous.</v>

1475
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to figure out what's going on.</v>

1476
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully,</v>

1477
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 1>and we'll be back in about 10 to 15 minutes.</v>

1478
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that that probably a accurate,</v>

1479
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that was a lightening bolt.</v>

1480
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's got to walk it off auto.</v>

1481
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk it off.</v>

1482
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.451
<v Speaker 1>10 15 minutes.</v>

1483
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you guys a little bit.</v>

1484
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:38.831
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1485
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
