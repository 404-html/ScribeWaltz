00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

120
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to do this.</v>

121
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to throw a flute in the</v>

122
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:38.870
<v Speaker 2>mix and then everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

123
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

124
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.903
<v Speaker 2>it kind of works.</v>

125
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Should we get a flute?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

126
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:46.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing this show last weekend and</v>

127
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:49.790
<v Speaker 3>this guy had an oboe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like the in San Francisco.</v>

128
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the oboist in the world and he's</v>

129
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:56.390
<v Speaker 3>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this instrument is very melancholy,</v>

130
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 3>just beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it really</v>

131
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>was occurring to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

132
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>who built this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who thought this sound was so important</v>

133
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>when they decided we're going to make an</v>
<v Speaker 2>instrument so we can re recreate this</v>

134
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.760
<v Speaker 2>feeling and this sound for all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments and the stuff.</v>

135
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 2>She gave me a pen and a paper and told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to draw an Oba,</v>

136
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not what I thought it was.</v>

138
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.373
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

139
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>before he pulled up a picture of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me think of what it looks like.</v>

140
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to think,</v>

141
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking of a trombone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of a thing,</v>

142
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was way bigger.</v>

143
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll kind of pull it up.</v>

144
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what the elbow is straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

145
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a flute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

146
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>it's straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks almost like a clarinet.</v>

147
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Clarinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

148
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Not a flute that looks more clarinet was</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad ass</v>

149
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.350
<v Speaker 2>oboe and pop that's in waterworld not</v>
<v Speaker 2>done moving.</v>

150
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an example of world's a terrible</v>

151
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 2>moving water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>World's a terrible movie,</v>

152
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but they have a damn good themed show at</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>

153
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

154
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 2>But it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like nobody watched that fucking</v>

155
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:09.821
<v Speaker 2>movie and it was a gigantic flop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still in 2018 they put on a Jamun</v>

156
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>live show kicks ass waterworld so</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

157
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

158
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this based on?</v>

159
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 2>This is some sort of dystopian world</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like everybody is drowning,</v>

160
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 2>The water is risen to the top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

162
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 2>And then these baddies and good people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and then this done people that are</v>

163
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 2>risking their lives is explosions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>file flying jet skis.</v>

164
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I went to see what my salary is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

165
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 2>We got fucking drenched by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to go to see this good</v>

166
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>seats don't go during the cold that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

167
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Good or bad seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

168
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 2>that shit goes up into the 15th 16th</v>
<v Speaker 2>rose.</v>

169
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a good production value.</v>

170
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's great cause it's like a play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun to watch.</v>

171
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 2>That's it's very enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all Kevin Costner had to do was</v>

172
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 2>just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have to make that check.</v>

173
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Antic movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie just hopper.</v>

174
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 2>That movie was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some friends that worked on it.</v>

175
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>There were stunt people and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about the amount of money</v>

176
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 2>that like whenever you feel me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything involving water,</v>

177
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>like you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is insanely expensive.</v>

178
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Camera's here.</v>

179
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's all under water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's water.</v>

180
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It's wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's wet.</v>

181
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.864
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.910
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy and it sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aw,</v>

183
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.410
<v Speaker 2>it did suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to watch it actually.</v>

184
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Basically fucking terrible movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool idea that like the seas have</v>

185
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>risen and there you've got to either</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to live on this boat.</v>

186
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like he's in like a fight for his</v>

187
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 2>life and shit and he's going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigar in his mouth and they love those</v>

188
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:43.551
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And they have weird like comedic guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Dennis Hopper is kind of looks</v>

190
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of weird.</v>

191
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I see like these guys are about to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he's got a cigar in his mouth.</v>

192
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.471
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

193
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 2>everybody's dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's wet out.</v>

194
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the water.</v>

195
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 2>You fuck dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stinky bitch.</v>

196
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Just there's water everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great point.</v>

197
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Why are they filthy places a tub?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's a rip off of Mad Max.</v>

198
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max.</v>

199
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 2>The dystopian Mad Max movie was made at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place with no fucking water here in</v>

200
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>the desert and a reason to be dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking plagiarists just jump in the</v>

201
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting for his life and he's got</v>

202
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 2>a cigar in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spit the Cigarro Yukon.</v>

203
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

204
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did like that boat though.</v>

205
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>That was a pretty cool boat that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could control.</v>

206
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad,</v>

207
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nearly as bad as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>postman.</v>

208
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.520
<v Speaker 2>The Post Osman was another dystopian</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie that was a colossal failure</v>

209
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 2>starring Kevin Costner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Kevin Costner,</v>

210
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 2>who I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shitting on Kevin Costner,</v>

211
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 2>was huge.</v>

212
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Costner Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

213
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.790
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in a couple of stinkers to kind</v>

214
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>of shark tanked him for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Postman from 1997 is one of the</v>

215
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.600
<v Speaker 2>worst in the history of bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bad that I will get high and watch it</v>

216
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.820
<v Speaker 2>occasionally just for the fucking Yuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's CBT.</v>

219
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.730

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like who is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Costner has to deliver the</v>

223
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 2>letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this big in the future.</v>

224
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no PA post office anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's gotta be like the post man,</v>

225
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to kill them book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fucking get him.</v>

226
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>He's got to run across the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

227
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I've got lettuce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the mail.</v>

228
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing the fuck you doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these letters?</v>

229
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to bring them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

230
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 2>We communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just all because of dances with</v>

231
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 2>wolves was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to like re do it.</v>

232
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not nothing like dances with</v>

233
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them back in the woods.</v>

234
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I think this is based on a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

235
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 2>See if that movie the postman is based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a novel.</v>

236
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:57.831
<v Speaker 2>I think it's based on a science fixture</v>
<v Speaker 2>or future fiction novel.</v>

237
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never even heard of that movie.</v>

238
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so bad.</v>

239
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

240
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>it is man at a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

241
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

242
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:09.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

243
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be like post nuclear</v>

244
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.750
<v Speaker 2>war or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's trying to stop them?</v>

245
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 2>People don't like mail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what year it takes place in hope.</v>

246
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Let me guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014</v>

247
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other day we were looking at,</v>

248
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.364
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

249
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 2>blade runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blade runner is 2019.</v>

250
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Original one was 2019.</v>

251
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next year flying cars robusto off.</v>

252
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Not so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might make it a book loan fast.</v>

253
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 2>The thing is whatever does happen will</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen so fast.</v>

254
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 2>We'll wish for something like blade</v>
<v Speaker 2>runner where there's some sort of</v>

255
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.570
<v Speaker 2>intermediate world where the technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people coexist,</v>

256
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're just to be,</v>

257
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just</v>

258
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 4>going to be plugged into it like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matrix.</v>

259
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to be slow and then all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden it's going to be just,</v>

260
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to 1994 which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially when most people started</v>

261
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>logging on to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got mail.</v>

262
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 24 years ago.</v>

263
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a long time nets at tiny</v>

264
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 1>brief little moment in human history and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 24 years,</v>

265
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>the world's radically changed the way it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets information completely.</v>

266
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Completely right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go 24 years from now,</v>

267
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to be accelerated 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>fold from that point.</v>

268
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>The moment artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to moment,</v>

269
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>autonomous cars started happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment the boring company actually</v>

270
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 1>has tunnels going through the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>La and all of it's going to be fucking</v>

271
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>

272
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.550
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy from a tesla energy at my</v>
<v Speaker 4>house yesterday and uh,</v>

273
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 4>they bought solar city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's no longer this solar company.</v>

274
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 4>They're now tesla energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tesla energies now of a car,</v>

275
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 4>the trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the batteries,</v>

276
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Speaker 4>the power wall generators and the solar</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

277
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 4>this guy comes in like he's from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

278
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 4>He is dressed like a future guy in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>like black fitted thing,</v>

279
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 4>these kind of like those shoes but in</v>
<v Speaker 4>white and he just kind of comes in.</v>

280
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 4>He's really sharp and like really clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just goes through the thing.</v>

281
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 4>He's probably an adderall and her thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

282
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to put a solar on the</v>

283
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 4>roofs and then you have your power wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're still connected to the grid</v>

284
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 4>because you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to for political reasons,</v>

285
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 4>but their whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to create tesla neighborhoods</v>

286
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 4>where everybody starts feeding off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

287
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 4>They're just completely autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tesla neighborhoods.</v>

288
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where you just said though about that</v>

289
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 4>it's politically motivated that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why they have to stay on the</v>

290
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 4>grid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the only reason.</v>

291
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 4>It's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't need it,</v>

292
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 4>but in order to get things passed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can like have that big battery and</v>

293
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 4>you're in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't let that happen unless,</v>

294
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>because that really would mean that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're completely cut off.</v>

295
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 4>And the politicians just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

296
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 4>that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

297
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.663
<v Speaker 4>Because</v>

298
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a more efficient way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the power from the sun.</v>

299
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It's cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better for everybody.</v>

300
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And yet they're still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

301
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to keep these jobs,</v>

302
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>keep the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to slow down progress.</v>

303
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>We know we don't want everybody to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to radically readjust.</v>

304
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

305
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 4>and the costs are for energy or just</v>
<v Speaker 4>going up so quickly that in like three</v>

306
00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you pay in southern California,</v>

307
00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:30.390
<v Speaker 4>he's almost going to double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's three years.</v>

308
00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:31.224
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

309
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

310
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to reach benchmarks by 2020</v>

311
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.220
<v Speaker 4>did you see what Tesla did in Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rico?</v>

312
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.773
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it do.</v>

313
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I remember him saying he was going to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and then there was no news coverage</v>

314
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but their whole infrastructure was wiped</v>

315
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:52.851
<v Speaker 4>out during the hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like completely that old electric shot.</v>

316
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 4>He had all these power walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're giant batteries about the size</v>

317
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 4>of the flag and they just store all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this energy like a year's worth of</v>

318
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 4>energy you can store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were about to be shipped to</v>

319
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 4>customers here in the u s who bought</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

320
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 4>who want them in their house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know his backup generators basically</v>

321
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to ship in January.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not shipping now until April</v>

322
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 4>because he decided these people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Puerto Rico need energy,</v>

323
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.640
<v Speaker 4>took all of those power walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ship them to Puerto Rico and has built</v>

324
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 4>this new infrastructure for Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hospitals are running on Tesla,</v>

325
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 4>schools are running on Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

326
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods are running on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was this quiet little story like</v>

327
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a kick ass company that went in</v>

328
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 4>and literally is saving this island.</v>

329
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>No Sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Oprah.</v>

330
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.170
<v Speaker 1>We need Elan Musk to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tired of people saying Oprah the last</v>

331
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>couple of days have been hell for crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Oprah.</v>

332
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's a wonderful woman.</v>

333
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I think she's a powerful force of good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and positive energy.</v>

334
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.111
<v Speaker 1>But Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

335
00:15:57.111 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Eli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she also brought us doctor Oz and</v>

336
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the secret we have to remember with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady has done,</v>

337
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 1>she has to be held accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgive her,</v>

338
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but I mean cut the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secret is a particularly egregious</v>

339
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you don't,</v>

340
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't believe,</v>

341
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:21.281
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe who believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be rich.</v>

342
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I just am rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine myself flying.</v>

343
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I can fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will beat my wings until I take off</v>

344
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.913
<v Speaker 1>what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the more confused I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to disturb,</v>

346
00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:39.620
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was confusing when that was</v>

347
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 1>taking hold with people.</v>

348
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 1>When I had friends that were telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the secret is real and that they</v>

349
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 1>imagine they were going to fulfill these</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood dreams that they had had about</v>

350
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a fucking astronaut,</v>

351
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it would be.</v>

352
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple people that I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to tell me that the</v>

353
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:02.300
<v Speaker 1>secret was going to be the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had a vision board and they</v>

354
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 1>had photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put pictures up of the things that</v>

355
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like them in front of large crowds and</v>

356
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

357
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the front of large crowds.</v>

358
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>This is so not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>But there is a kernel of it that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

360
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Causative thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wanting something,</v>

361
00:17:20.261 --> 00:17:24.550
<v Speaker 4>you envisioning it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a little component and just</v>

362
00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 4>how you live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just sitting in your,</v>

363
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.750
<v Speaker 4>you know what it's like and wishing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

364
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to be a bodybuilder because I</v>

365
00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:36.250
<v Speaker 1>drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.031
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

367
00:17:37.031 --> 00:17:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah Geez.</v>

368
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Where do I start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You?</v>

369
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You should drink water and it will help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you want to be a bodybuilder.</v>

370
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.370
<v Speaker 1>But I've talked to all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders and the one thing they have</v>

371
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>in common is all drank water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they knew that if they drank water,</v>

372
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>they would be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be giant,</v>

373
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>huge people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all you've got to go.</v>

374
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did they also perform reps to</v>

375
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 1>failure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they also take steroids?</v>

376
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Did they also do these exercises?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squats,</v>

377
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curls,</v>

378
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they do all that stuff too?</v>

379
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that but the water,</v>

380
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you believe her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's like cause cause</v>

381
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they're saying like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

382
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>they believe that they can do these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

383
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.370
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

385
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>they had this vision and they focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vision and it came to fruition.</v>

386
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what they also did?</v>

387
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 1>They also busted their fucking ass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got lucky and we're in a business or</v>

388
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:34.551
<v Speaker 1>career that they had some talent in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out what that career is and</v>

389
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:40.491
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to navigate the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird waters of social interaction and</v>

390
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.280
<v Speaker 1>skill acquisition and success and</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure and learn from your failure and</v>

391
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem is you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with complete sampling bias.</v>

393
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only asking people that are in</v>

394
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the mansions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Papa,</v>

395
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>how did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I see you here,</v>

396
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 1>you have this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as big as the White House.</v>

397
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 1>You have a giant lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did judge always know this was going to</v>

398
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:08.490
<v Speaker 1>be your reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it and I just put it on my vision</v>

399
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:09.324
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

400
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it doesn't stick around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

401
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 1>didn't it became a fad because all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

402
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 1>well at some point that's take the board</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

403
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Well and unfortunately some people died</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

404
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a story I was reading about</v>

405
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:29.331
<v Speaker 1>oprah unfortunately where this woman had</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminal cancer and she,</v>

406
00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 1>she had stage three breast cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just decided that through the secret she</v>

407
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 1>was going to imagine herself a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>person and you know,</v>

408
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.410
<v Speaker 1>she eventually want them dying from it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she,</v>

409
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.010
<v Speaker 1>she didn't get treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The IAA I know,</v>

410
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stopped traditional.</v>

411
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.970
<v Speaker 1>She stopped conventional medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>

412
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 1>But what part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how far do you go with positive</v>

413
00:19:57.061 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I see you as a fellow that,</v>

414
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has goals and I would think positive</v>

415
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>thinking plays into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that even mean?</v>

416
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do I think positive?</v>

417
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a positive way.</v>

418
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I try to be positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

419
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but when you're trying to accomplish</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

420
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>whether you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

421
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 1>get better at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're playing a game,</v>

422
00:20:24.931 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 1>like what if let's like golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say take up golf and you want to be</v>

423
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>a really good golfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you start thinking about golf,</v>

424
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 1>like how do I get better at golf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn if to pay attention to</v>

425
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 1>instructional videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to maybe seek out coaching.</v>

426
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to play some games and lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to choke under pressure.</v>

427
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You have to examine the mental game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is wrong with my mental</v>

428
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:49.510
<v Speaker 1>process when I approach a shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with this?</v>

429
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:52.500
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then become obsessed with the,</v>

430
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.570
<v Speaker 1>the idea of succeeding in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that can apply to</v>

431
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

432
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I certainly believe in positive</v>

433
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.550
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

434
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that was like mystic nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

435
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that tips over and it discounts all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that you have to do.</v>

436
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.830
<v Speaker 1>There's something to the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction.</v>

437
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is one component to this gigantic</v>

438
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.640
<v Speaker 1>sort of spectrum of factors that have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be taken into consideration when you're</v>

439
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:25.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to succeed at something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Positive thinking is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

441
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the understanding of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate laziness,</v>

442
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 1>how to discipline yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to write down goals,</v>

443
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make incremental steps towards</v>

444
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to recognize failure is not just the</v>

445
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 1>end of all your hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact the beginning of a new</v>

446
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough because you understand like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to never do this wrong,</v>

447
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.050
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong way again,</v>

448
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and the consequences of doing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

449
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

450
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of factors in getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and succeeding at things and they</v>

451
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 1>boiled it down to the easiest one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is dreaming.</v>

452
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

453
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

454
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Oprah sold it.</v>

455
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.063
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

456
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.910
<v Speaker 1>she was one of the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>

457
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.780
<v Speaker 1>She was fucking 50 years old at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

458
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a young woman who was</v>

459
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>selling this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is open now?</v>

460
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 1>75 89 no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just ran a marathon in four hours.</v>

461
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.581
<v Speaker 1>Did she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

462
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 1>67 63 so we ran a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:22:29.111 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think of when the secret came out.</v>

464
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that was like 2006 six</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004 2006 so 12 years ago she was so she</v>

465
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 1>was 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did you not know when</v>

466
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you're 50 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worth $1 billion that that's not</v>

467
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's Hocus pocus.</v>

468
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not hocus pocus.</v>

469
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to sell that to people is crazy.</v>

470
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's a book that's sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was reading it sold somewhere</v>

471
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 1>in the neighborhood of 20 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies.</v>

472
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it tells you on?</v>

473
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

474
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want an easy way.</v>

475
00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:08.400
<v Speaker 4>You want something that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants,</v>

476
00:23:08.401 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 4>you're in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're feeling whatever and they want</v>

477
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:13.860
<v Speaker 4>something to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something come and help me.</v>

478
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's where religion comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just please,</v>

479
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 4>there's that thing inside of us is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

480
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to believe if I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that enough?</v>

481
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It is a lot like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.190
<v Speaker 1>There was one of trump's spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>advisors was,</v>

483
00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got some spiritual advisors,</v>

484
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:31.490
<v Speaker 1>some woman who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

485
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.890
<v Speaker 1>telling people to send her money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a set,</v>

486
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.250
<v Speaker 1>send her money for January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some,</v>

487
00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:40.940
<v Speaker 1>so some whole article about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically essentially the same</v>

488
00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:43.460
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea is that,</v>

489
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>what is she saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald spiritual advisor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Paula white suggest people send her</v>
<v Speaker 1>there January salary or face</v>

491
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Speaker 1>consequences from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

492
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 1>She's attractive too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

493
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Paula?</v>

497
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>How much do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a good picture.</v>

498
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she just looks good when she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming and she looks good.</v>

499
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

500
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I would love for some really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love for the day where there's</v>

501
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.490

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

506
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 1>it would be so great if some like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you listen to some people,</v>

508
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 1>like I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing some Gig and there was this</v>

509
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>black preacher and he was out on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking and it was like he's</v>

510
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 1>really entertaining and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had a couple of Nice things that</v>

<v Speaker 1>your money.</v>

512
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:43.521
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>

513
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>imagine if a guy showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

516
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Gary Vee for instance.</v>

517
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Gary v's whole thing is about hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary v's like the anti secret.</v>

518
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>He's hand tie the secret in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

519
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at like what Gary Vee does.</v>

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Gary Vee is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick for several days,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got the flu.</v>

524
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

525
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I left here.</v>

526
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>

527
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

528
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm diverting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me,</v>

529
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 1>let me just get back to this Gary v</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

530
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.480
<v Speaker 1>But what guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to talk colds,</v>

531
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 1>those book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if he's the best</v>

532
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.360
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sells books,</v>

533
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but he's not asking for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

534
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 1>he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's actually a guy who was,</v>

535
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.000
<v Speaker 1>he's experienced some success as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur.</v>

536
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And I listened to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I say this without being mean?</v>

537
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice online because people react well</v>

538
00:25:47.151 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 1>to it because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giving advice because when they</v>

539
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>give advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people respond to it and they say,</v>

540
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

541
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll blanket and they'll,</v>

542
00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 1>they'll give them positive feedback and</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

543
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.730
<v Speaker 1>but their advice is at least a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of it is just nonsense.</v>

544
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Speaker 1>They're just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

545
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to say things</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've heard before or they're trying</v>

546
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:16.511
<v Speaker 1>to somehow or another put together a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence that sounds like you'll get</v>

547
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 1>some likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.423
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

549
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to surround yourself with</v>

550
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>positive people to crystally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes fun of those people in a</v>

551
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:26.020
<v Speaker 1>hilarious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

552
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Or is it about Comedians who do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

553
00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 1>just not just comedians who do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just people do it.</v>

554
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.330
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people will say things that</v>

555
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 1>are real and are really inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

556
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just knowing,</v>

557
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 1>knowing horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

558
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Speaker 2>You got to know Horse Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know a lot of people don't know where</v>

559
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.170
<v Speaker 2>the Horse Shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This secret is horse shit.</v>

560
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 2>See that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary v is inspirational and</v>

561
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:56.700
<v Speaker 2>motivational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there's a lot of people</v>

562
00:26:56.701 --> 00:27:00.930
<v Speaker 2>out there that have done things in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that they might not have done</v>

563
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 2>because of Gary v because he's a hustler</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's really got a lot of energy</v>

564
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking put down your phone.</v>

565
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and get things done.</v>

566
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Sleep an hour less sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking hour left.</v>

567
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 2>And it'll just tell you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>

568
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:14.960
<v Speaker 2>sell that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

569
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 2>And it gives you practical advice about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get started and get things done.</v>

570
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like the opposite of the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this what seminars?</v>

571
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Gary does shows at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like Tony Robbins,</v>

572
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 2>he just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's more like,</v>

573
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean Tony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he younger,</v>

574
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.270
<v Speaker 2>more energetic hustler character</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystal.</v>

575
00:27:32.271 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He lives in the same play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This give you some volume.</v>

576
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says you could do anything you put</v>

577
00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:47.590
<v Speaker 5>your mind to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most things is perseverance.</v>

578
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 5>He's got an ego to shut down the town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopping,</v>

579
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.080
<v Speaker 5>remaining focused,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never quitting.</v>

580
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.700
<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he does all those things as</v>

581
00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:05.150
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from his last special.</v>

582
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile it works really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is Chris actually does</v>

583
00:28:08.001 --> 00:28:09.410
<v Speaker 2>work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

584
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.330
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

585
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

586
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean Kevin Hart now has moved into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that realm.</v>

587
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.220
<v Speaker 2>He has so many people listen to them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they just,</v>

588
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

589
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

590
00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:23.870
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known him for a long time,</v>

591
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.680
<v Speaker 2>but now he's got so many followers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has so many people listening that</v>

592
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:29.600
<v Speaker 2>he's starting to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

593
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.520
<v Speaker 2>he's not just telling jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing crunches and telling you that</v>

594
00:28:33.521 --> 00:28:36.320
<v Speaker 2>you've got to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to my daughter,</v>

595
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.330
<v Speaker 2>my daughter was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he a comedian?</v>

596
00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:40.820
<v Speaker 2>She asked if she was showing the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

597
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:41.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really funny.</v>

598
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I saw that this is a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

599
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.740
<v Speaker 2>do you think I can make videos that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people to live better with David</v>

600
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:48.920
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

601
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.551
<v Speaker 2>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

602
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that too,</v>

603
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but if it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things that you know that you've</v>

604
00:28:55.971 --> 00:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>experienced and that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want people to know about,</v>

605
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:04.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's not everything I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with some people k all day,</v>

606
00:29:04.341 --> 00:29:06.620
<v Speaker 2>you're inspiring people.</v>

611
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.770
<v Speaker 2>there's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing about,</v>

612
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing about Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing about you that you</v>

613

<v Speaker 2>done and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll hear what he has to say.</v>

617
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.900
<v Speaker 2>There is that element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when it becomes bullshit.</v>

618
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it becomes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

621
00:29:34.521 --> 00:29:36.590
<v Speaker 2>And God talks to me and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

622
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's songs that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why does that resonate so,</v>

626
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 1>so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so profound?</v>

627
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And then there's songs we were like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>attention to them and to their social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some of it works.</v>

676
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lost and you're just,</v>

677

<v Speaker 1>but yet they're there and they're there,</v>

685
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that any worse than an open miker</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

726
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>they realize early on that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at coaching than they are</v>

727
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I saw it coming.</v>

777
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

778
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this is happening.</v>

779
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:17.590
<v Speaker 2>She's actually trying to punch me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to punch where they just can</v>

780
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 2>make a bunch of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw her shoulder pull back.</v>

781
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way this is actually</v>

782
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:22.460
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

784
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 2>It gets fighting at the time.</v>

785
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>So I was used to people punching me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as she's pulling her shoulder back</v>

786
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:29.961
<v Speaker 2>and Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this camp,</v>

787
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 2>we were really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe this is happening.</v>

788
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening.</v>

789
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

790
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.620
<v Speaker 2>but I think she just wanted attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she actually,</v>

791
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I think she's pretty sure that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to land.</v>

792
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 2>You know that if she threw a punch at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was just going to,</v>

793
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 2>cause it's just really wanted to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

794
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 2>She fucking hit me when I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>

795
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do.</v>

796
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't just look right at you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you motherfucker.</v>

797
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people are in the height of some</v>

798
00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 2>sort of fucking Sicilian love rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

799
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to mess with that</v>

800
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 2>screaming and the yelling and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing things around.</v>

801
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 2>That's also very east coast.</v>

802
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this ad Nauseum,</v>

803
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 2>but I really believe that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>echoes of those fucking barbarians that</v>

804
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 2>came over on boats from Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 2>And didn't even know what America looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

<v Speaker 2>on rafts and start a fucking,</v>

808
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:29.600
<v Speaker 2>immediately they started baking bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling up pasta bagging.</v>

809
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We'll have to toast it out to eat it</v>

824
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 2>today is the best way to eat it today or</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow?</v>

825
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Actually tomorrow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Why is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it just came out.</v>

828
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's if you want that warm.</v>

830
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really it's,</v>

831
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>it gets even better a day after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:17.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the case with tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

833
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that if you bought</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sushi,</v>

834
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to get fresh Sushi and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulled it out of the wire.</v>

835
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 2>They're going to slice it up for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

836
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 2>But no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to like a real master Sushi</v>

837
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>maker,</v>

842
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.480

<v Speaker 2>master.</v>

843
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.343
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero?</v>

<v Speaker 2>but that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's something to that man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the best.</v>

872
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing one thing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like God,</v>

873
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something,</v>

874
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something to especially like</v>

875
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mindset of every day trying to learn</v>

876
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:53.500
<v Speaker 2>how to make that egg dish perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one egg dish that one guy said he'd</v>

877
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 2>worked on for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

878
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>A fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the eggs,</v>

879
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.420
<v Speaker 2>all that just completely doing it over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over and over.</v>

880
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 2>My bread thing is not I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably like you're both thing,</v>

881
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 2>the bread thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you do just start to like</v>

882
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 2>focus on this one thing and trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it well and you just start to get,</v>

883
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a part of you.</v>

884
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:18.580
<v Speaker 2>You're starting to put yourself into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just making bread,</v>

885
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a practice.</v>

886
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It is something that for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years I've just kind of gone down that</v>

887
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.760
<v Speaker 2>wormhole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

888
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worm.</v>

889
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing that one thing I really,</v>

890
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that sometimes with with</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup it's like we've all these other</v>

891
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 2>things that are always going on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling us in different directions and</v>

892
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.750
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it's like if you could just</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus purely on just if that was the</v>

893
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 2>only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't taking any phone calls on</v>

894
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:48.450
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't podcasts and you weren't</v>

895
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 2>writing scripts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't appearing on whatever,</v>

896
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>like would that make a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like would you be yes and no because I</v>

897
00:40:56.591 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 2>think that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it requires a certain amount of</v>

898
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 2>dedication and a certain amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>on stage,</v>

899
00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think it also requires certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of living.</v>

900
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to do other things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>although podcasting seems like a job and</v>

901
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>a distraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing it is unquestionably is</v>

902
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an exploration of ideas,</v>

903
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At an unprecedented level.</v>

904
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exploring ideas without looking</v>

905
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 2>at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without talk.</v>

906
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.400
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are talking to three hours.</v>

907
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.190
<v Speaker 2>When does that ever happen in life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

908
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>No it doesn't.</v>

909
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of ideas that I come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with through stand up or in standup that</v>

910
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>came out of podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

911
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.990
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

912
00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

913
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Your mind's active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

914
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that writing similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>writings,</v>

915
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same kind of a thing.</v>

916
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think doing stuff is</v>

917
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 1>important too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just the actual sit down talking</v>

918
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>part of your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually going places,</v>

919
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 1>being active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to experience things.</v>

920
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.040
<v Speaker 1>You have to watch documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to a museum,</v>

921
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you have to go see things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got to go talk to people.</v>

922
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:09.800
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go on adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To go travel.</v>

923
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It's filling up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.913
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

925
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to think of your brain almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your crossfit,</v>

926
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.310
<v Speaker 1>not crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

927
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that word?</v>

928
00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Where you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross training?</v>

929
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what I'm looking for when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a bunch of different kinds</v>

930
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:27.250
<v Speaker 1>of multitasking that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

931
00:42:27.251 --> 00:42:27.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

932
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Different types of athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic activities that will enhance</v>

933
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 1>your sport if you play hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

934
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't just do hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also are involved in the box jumps.</v>

935
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

936
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprinting up hill,</v>

937
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:46.430
<v Speaker 1>These all these things enhance this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity and it's not just all you have</v>

939
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:50.900
<v Speaker 1>to do is just skate all day and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the best skater while you may be,</v>

940
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 1>or you could get better at the motions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of skating by strengthening your legs</v>

941
00:42:55.641 --> 00:43:00.290
<v Speaker 1>with weightlifting or doing this and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can accelerate your curve by doing yoga</v>

942
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:01.124
<v Speaker 1>or you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that that there's something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with comedy,</v>

944
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:05.984
<v Speaker 1>at least for,</v>

945
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.921
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

946
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:07.581
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

947
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:10.400
<v Speaker 4>when I'm really actively writing other</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

948
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 4>whether it's scripts or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

949
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 4>my writing for standup improves does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

950
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And reading,</v>

951
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading,</v>

952
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 4>writing stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all feeds the act.</v>

953
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you then shift your focus over</v>

954
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the act,</v>

955
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:34.240
<v Speaker 4>you're better because of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do sometimes think like the Sushi</v>

956
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:36.080
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

957
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 4>but what if the output was only geared</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards that?</v>

958
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 4>The input I get doing all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But would there be a difference?</v>

959
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

960
00:43:44.681 --> 00:43:46.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

961
00:43:46.631 --> 00:43:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody who does that way</v>

962
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:49.074
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

963
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe at him.</v>

964
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Regan plays golf and drinks and does</v>

965
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not creating other art.</v>

966
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>He's not writing scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

967
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 1>he also doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

968
00:44:02.001 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

969
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 1>He writes like cutting his head and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes on stage and works on stuff.</v>

970
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

971
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I'm torn on.</v>

972
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

973
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do it amazingly well and</v>

974
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that's how they've created incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>works of art.</v>

975
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 1>But I never give that advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever anyone asks me,</v>

976
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do both.</v>

977
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You should write down things and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should write on a computer.</v>

978
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

979
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Or however you like to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should also fuck around on</v>

980
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should do both.</v>

981
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

982
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

983
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't just show up on stage and hope</v>

984
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:38.754
<v Speaker 4>it's going to happen.</v>

985
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some ideas that I've had that</v>

986
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:45.861
<v Speaker 1>I'll like literally like have in my car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll bounce them around by</v>

987
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 1>myself a little bit and not having ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>written them down.</v>

988
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll go onstage and then it'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch fire and it will become a bit,</v>

989
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and there's some bits that have made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to specials that I've never even written</v>

990
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew how to do them because I did</v>

991
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 1>them a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of them,</v>

992
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 1>not though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them not,</v>

993
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:09.830
<v Speaker 4>or at least I always feel like I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring an idea up on stage that hasn't</v>

994
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 4>been written down yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something there,</v>

995
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I bring it back to the shop and</v>

996
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 4>we'll play with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

997
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.230
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes this back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

998
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what one example,</v>

999
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:26.220
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bounced around,</v>

1000
00:45:26.221 --> 00:45:31.221
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about in the car and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought it onto stage in a completed</v>

1001
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 1>form and it never really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit about,</v>

1002
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot.</v>

1003
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you don't find.</v>

1004
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 1>When you go looking for bigfoot black</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1005
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 1>like you're more likely to find big</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

1006
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:49.521
<v Speaker 1>Then you are black people looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot and just fine hordes of</v>

1007
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.810
<v Speaker 1>unfuckable white dudes out camping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she fine.</v>

1008
00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it goes.</v>

1009
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Looking for bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

1010
00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't find it's not African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastime and that that bit came out in</v>

1011
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:07.890
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made myself laugh and then it never</v>

1012
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just became that.</v>

1013
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I ever wrote it down</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

1014
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Hated it into my 2014 comedy central</v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

1015
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's rare.</v>

1016
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Those are the rare ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is rare,</v>

1017
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if they were all came that</v>

1018
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It's been a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're usually,</v>

1020
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:29.820
<v Speaker 1>for some reason they're one liners to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1021
00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.580
<v Speaker 1>He's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just complete.</v>

1022
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just,</v>

1023
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>they just formed themselves complete.</v>

1024
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just a bowser best too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you makes you laugh.</v>

1025
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's things that you've just</v>

1026
00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:44.471
<v Speaker 4>thinking your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:46.480
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a funny thing and then you bring</v>

1028
00:46:46.481 --> 00:46:48.130
<v Speaker 4>it up on stage and it becomes really</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny,</v>

1029
00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:51.160
<v Speaker 4>but when it really just truly makes you</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh,</v>

1030
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:52.840
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a,</v>

1031
00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1032
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 4>it is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When there's</v>

1033
00:46:55.270 --> 00:47:00.180
<v Speaker 1>thing that he just clicks to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just start giggling,</v>

1034
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.530
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Those are my favorite kind of jokes</v>

1036
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:04.981
<v Speaker 4>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1037
00:47:04.981 --> 00:47:06.270
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

1038
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.470
<v Speaker 4>that's why you started making people</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh as a kid in the first place was</v>

1039
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 4>just having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes as an adult you've got all</v>

1040
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:17.100
<v Speaker 4>this other stuff in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you do have to kind of remind</v>

1041
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:18.330
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fun.</v>

1042
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 4>This is silly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should be giggle enjoyable,</v>

1043
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.151
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 4>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.440
<v Speaker 4>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it can be,</v>

1046
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.410
<v Speaker 4>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1047
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 4>because it out of writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other stuff that does come out of</v>

1048
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 4>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing can be a grind.</v>

1049
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 4>Writing is insular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's by yourself.</v>

1050
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 4>You're just in there alone doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not this joyful place.</v>

1051
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not writing like,</v>

1052
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's not painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So painful.</v>

1053
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is a practice that is different</v>

1054
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 4>than just being with your buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about big foot.</v>

1055
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:51.021
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:47:51.021 --> 00:47:51.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.520
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the fun ones,</v>

1058
00:47:53.521 --> 00:47:55.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big foot ones are the ones that come</v>

1059
00:47:55.561 --> 00:47:58.010
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere with no effort and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill and like,</v>

1060
00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I got this for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like got some crazy scape or the</v>

1061
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.600
<v Speaker 1>not worried about damaging cars and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it for a hundred years.</v>

1062
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:07.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.280
<v Speaker 4>No writing's not painful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is a thing,</v>

1064
00:48:10.281 --> 00:48:13.370
<v Speaker 4>there is a mental part where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

1065
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.670
<v Speaker 4>if you're ever like put it down for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>while and don't do it,</v>

1066
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.700
<v Speaker 4>it's like you gotta get your head back</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the space of doing it.</v>

1067
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.460
<v Speaker 4>That could be a little painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that hard.</v>

1068
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:23.743
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1069
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.430
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you ever read,</v>

1070
00:48:26.431 --> 00:48:29.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pressfield's book the war of art.</v>

1071
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's excellent.</v>

1072
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's so good that I bought stacks of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I used to hand it out to people on</v>

1073
00:48:34.681 --> 00:48:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1074
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think most people like when</v>

1075
00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:40.560
<v Speaker 1>you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if someone says like what's the</v>

1076
00:48:40.561 --> 00:48:44.610
<v Speaker 1>difference between guys who get things</v>
<v Speaker 1>done and guys who go don't get things</v>

1077
00:48:44.611 --> 00:48:45.444
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1078
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.310
<v Speaker 1>this sounds so stupid simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that get things done do</v>

1079
00:48:50.311 --> 00:48:52.080
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually do it.</v>

1080
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.200
<v Speaker 1>They sit down and do it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the people that don't</v>

1081
00:48:55.201 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>get things done that stops them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1082
00:48:57.061 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pressfield calls it resistance.</v>

1083
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And what he says is that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to overcome resistance because</v>

1084
00:49:06.991 --> 00:49:10.290
<v Speaker 1>that's where professionals do you sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down because you,</v>

1085
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you have affirmed that you are a pro and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit down and you go over what you</v>

1086
00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:16.830
<v Speaker 1>are going to do.</v>

1087
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.670
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I A professional I've,</v>

1088
00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1089
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to sit down and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write and I'm going to summon the</v>

1090
00:49:23.521 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Muse and the Muse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1091
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.890
<v Speaker 1>whether the muse is a real thing or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he treats it as it's as it's a real</v>

1092
00:49:28.891 --> 00:49:31.170
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the concept is that you are going to</v>

1093
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:36.171
<v Speaker 1>summon this thing that you call upon to</v>
<v Speaker 1>endow you with creativity and that doing</v>

1094
00:49:36.721 --> 00:49:38.200
<v Speaker 1>the work by doing the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And then that overcoming this resistance</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the war of art and um,</v>

1096
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what is the resistance then?</v>

1097
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my negative thoughts really.</v>

1098
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just negative thoughts.</v>

1099
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It's resisting work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1100
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not negative in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1101
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1102
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.230
<v Speaker 1>something's po stopping you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeding.</v>

1103
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Something stopping you from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from pushing forward and putting down</v>

1104
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:07.470
<v Speaker 1>those ideas</v>

1105
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.140
<v Speaker 4>you want the easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to just sit on the couch.</v>

1106
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Like in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a couch and I have a desk and the</v>

1107
00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:15.804
<v Speaker 4>couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1108
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing gets done.</v>

1109
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.220
<v Speaker 4>Nothing gets done on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1110
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.560
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1111
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.680
<v Speaker 4>it's about sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was this great a quote from this</v>

1112
00:50:25.681 --> 00:50:29.300
<v Speaker 4>Israeli writer who I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I'd say the quote I say,</v>

1113
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I always forget what his name was and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>should know it because he used the</v>

1114
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 4>quotes so often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he says that writing and the job of</v>

1115
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 4>being a writer is the same as being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shopkeeper and it's your job to go and</v>

1116
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 4>open the shop every day and some days</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing happens.</v>

1117
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Some day you're just sitting in the shop</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an idiot behind the desk and</v>

1118
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:53.471
<v Speaker 4>nobody's there and then some days the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shop is buzzing with action and activity</v>

1119
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.780
<v Speaker 4>and people in and out and stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1120
00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 4>But all of those days when it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>busy and active does not happen unless</v>

1121
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 4>you opened the shop every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such an easy way for my brain to</v>

1122
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 4>kind of think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a brilliant way of putting it.</v>

1123
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:12.380
<v Speaker 4>Just go and sit down at the place where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do the work and start doing the</v>

1124
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He may not be great.</v>

1125
00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 4>That's not up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's going to be great,</v>

1126
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 4>it's up to you whether or not you sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>down and start working.</v>

1127
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever,</v>

1128
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I read Stephen King's on writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1129
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good one.</v>

1130
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Those are my two go to books when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like I need something to</v>

1131
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 1>recharge.</v>

1132
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Jan would be a good one to go back to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1133
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.450
<v Speaker 4>I read that one like a long time ago and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1134
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.980
<v Speaker 4>his just thing of you just like what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>

1135
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.130
<v Speaker 4>you just have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have to do,</v>

1136
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.670
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1137
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1138
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>there's days that I'll go and I'll write</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fucking hours and literally get</v>

1139
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 1>nothing out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>

1140
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1141
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit and then nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you judge yourself by that,</v>

1142
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.171
<v Speaker 1>you'd go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1143
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking terrible writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Stink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day you'll just sit down</v>

1145
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and then you have your next 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that they found that starts fires?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>embers and sticks that are on fire and s</v>

1153
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:31.660
<v Speaker 1>flies them across rivers and creeks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start the fires on the other side so</v>

1154
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:34.850
<v Speaker 1>that it could force a game animals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run away.</v>

1155
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Birds of prey are starting fires,</v>

1157
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:44.060
<v Speaker 1>deliberately kites and foulk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know kite was a bird.</v>

1158
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Kites and Falcons are intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping smoldering twigs to smoke out</v>

1159
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>mice and insects in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1160
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louise.</v>

1161
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Researchers of compile the study of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reports of wild bird spreading fires.</v>

1162
00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 1>They believe the birds carry these</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning twigs to unburnt parts of the</v>

1163
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Bush and the birds dropped them in a bid</v>
<v Speaker 1>to smoke out,</v>

1164
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:05.241
<v Speaker 1>pray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1165
00:53:05.241 --> 00:53:06.074
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1166
00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.320
<v Speaker 4>They also smoke three packs a day.</v>

1167
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The researchers said birds.</v>

1168
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Could you see the third force capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting bushfires?</v>

1169
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:16.990
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1170
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 1>there's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so irresponsible.</v>

1172
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 1>He's fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit about fires and they</v>

1173
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:24.330
<v Speaker 1>fly away like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1174
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.760
<v Speaker 1>fly where fire isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a mouse.</v>

1175
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.850
<v Speaker 1>All neighborhoods burnt down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got a mouse snacks,</v>

1176
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douche bags.</v>

1177
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that chicken that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers created that accidentally</v>

1178
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.520
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another through when they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it together,</v>

1179
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the face of a dinosaur.</v>

1180
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1181
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see if you can find that on my,</v>

1182
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 1>it's on my twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they made,</v>

1183
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 1>they made chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know what the fuck they did.</v>

1184
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I briefly read the article.</v>

1185
00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm like these motherfuckers and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran away but he got scared.</v>

1186
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He had to face is chicken as the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking dinosaur.</v>

1187
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Get teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chicken with the dinosaurs face.</v>

1188
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So who got the dinosaur stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

1189
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Who got the dinosaur DNA and put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that oh no gross face of a dinosaur.</v>

1190
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's earth dude?</v>

1191
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling people forever because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that I keep chickens now.</v>

1192
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Chickens are fucking monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are monsters.</v>

1193
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Speaker 1>They give good eggs though they do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>good eggs.</v>

1194
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:35.090
<v Speaker 1>But we have this idea of them as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cute little cuddly little fluffy</v>

1195
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.360
<v Speaker 1>things that lay eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just peck around now they're fucking</v>

1196
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:41.040
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even pull up the,</v>

1197
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:41.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1198
00:54:41.481 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of the article.</v>

1199
00:54:42.511 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Jamie go to the top of and make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger so I could read it there.</v>

1200
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what it says,</v>

1201
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:47.731
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1202
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:49.140
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Group of dinosaurs.</v>

1203
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:50.480
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep going,</v>

1204
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand how one change the other</v>

1205
00:54:56.401 --> 00:54:58.650
<v Speaker 1>team has been tampering with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular process,</v>

1206
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make up a beacon chickens.</v>

1207
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 1>By doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to create a chicken</v>

1208
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 1>embryo with a dinosaur likes snout and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>palette similar to that of feathered</v>

1209
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs like Velossa raptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making raptors.</v>

1210
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 1>The results are published in the journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

1211
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 1>The team's aim was to understand how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird beak evolved because the beak is</v>

1212
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:21.090
<v Speaker 1>such a vital part of birds and bird</v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomy.</v>

1213
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It's been crucial for their success to</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 or more.</v>

1214
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:29.090
<v Speaker 1>More species occupy a wide range of</v>
<v Speaker 1>habitats and many have specialized beaks</v>

1215
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 1>to help them survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it mess the mess with them.</v>

1216
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:36.300
<v Speaker 1>The neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular makeup of the beak.</v>

1217
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he made a fucking dinosaur phase</v>

1218
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:40.850
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

1219
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll be good when they're running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1220
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That will be great when they're at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>petting zoo.</v>

1221
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I bet they would have better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet they would have better eggs</v>

1222
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 1>because like my chicken's eggs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly better when I let them</v>

1223
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>loose and they go fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

1224
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.050
<v Speaker 1>like they'll eat mice and they'll eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>worms,</v>

1225
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.470
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs and then I'll get these dark yolks.</v>

1226
00:56:01.471 --> 00:56:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Like the last couple of days they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been running around my yard all day.</v>

1227
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.870
<v Speaker 1>So really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So the exit I'll collect tonight or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow will be dark orange,</v>

1229
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but when they're sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lazy.</v>

1230
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.940
<v Speaker 1>They're just in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1231
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.130
<v Speaker 1>well they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a very large coupe.</v>

1232
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 1>The coupe is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coop is essentially for the 19</v>

1233
00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven 17 now a of them died.</v>

1234
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 1>17</v>

1235
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 2>chickens I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically the size of this room.</v>

1236
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 2>So they all good space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got plenty of room to wander around</v>

1237
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and plenty of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they like when you ever see</v>

1238
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian raise chicken and vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't want that.</v>

1239
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just that.</v>

1240
00:56:41.401 --> 00:56:42.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll eat that if that's all you give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1241
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:46.830
<v Speaker 2>But they won't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't eat things like bugs.</v>

1242
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And worms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's most of it.</v>

1243
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.230
<v Speaker 2>But mice more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mice,</v>

1244
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 2>they found a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fight for it.</v>

1245
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the few things that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>will fight for real?</v>

1246
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:57.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1247
00:56:57.521 --> 00:57:01.330
<v Speaker 2>we'll grab the mouse and they will just</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase each other and try to fuck that</v>

1248
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 2>mouse up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are those eggs?</v>

1249
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell like who's laying the</v>

1250
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.210
<v Speaker 2>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with all the exit eggs?</v>

1251
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of them out to people.</v>

1252
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.270
<v Speaker 2>You can have some new ones in bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1253
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:11.921
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take some,</v>

1254
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:12.754
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some eggs.</v>

1255
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I got to meet for you to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk.</v>

1256
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I got songs I really started to crave to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

1257
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1258
00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1259
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a good serve it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could he for the meet?</v>

1260
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Me and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dog are so happy with the hell comes</v>

1261
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1262
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I showed you a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they send you a shot of Mike?</v>

1263
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 2>You cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was cooking up the ground alk and the</v>

1264
00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:36.280
<v Speaker 2>dog is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this right?</v>

1265
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grass fed butter and ground elk,</v>

1266
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 2>garlic salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

1267
00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:47.980
<v Speaker 2>With the eggs to and mix it up and eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I do.</v>

1268
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put it on a little bit of the sour</v>

1269
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 2>dough bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're thinking,</v>

1270
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the sourdough.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bad.</v>

1368
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I love golden retrievers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so good.</v>

1369
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are great dogs.</v>

1370
01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>They're so food oriented though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes to the point of being</v>

1371
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was my lab.</v>

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Labs are two,</v>

1374
01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're active,</v>

1375
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 2>they're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Metabolism is quick and they want to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make just yet.</v>

1377
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>The good news is they're really easy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>train with food because they love food</v>

1378
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give them like little treats and</v>

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>he's this dog that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have Marshall,</v>

1380
01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:19.590

<v Speaker 2>like listening to sit and stay and lie</v>

1382
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I go running with him,</v>

1383
01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stays close to me.</v>

1384
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs and then I'll like,</v>

1385
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:28.860

<v Speaker 1>he's ahead of me and I go,</v>

1386
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>

1387
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And they'll just stop and wait for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll come up to them.</v>

1388
01:02:33.131 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Then it'll start running again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1389
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

1390
01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken her off leash like that and I feel</v>

1391
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>like it'd be a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I worry about is</v>

1392
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue because I don't think he</v>

1394
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>knows exactly what a rattlesnake is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the instinct would kick in if he</v>

1395
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't get surprised by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were the war instincts.</v>

1396
01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wrong ones,</v>

1397
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>which are to get clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1398
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you think and get bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's think they'd be like all in ancient</v>

1399
01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Dna of hearing that rattle.</v>

1400
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three dogs that were bit by</v>

1401
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1402
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they went after it.</v>

1403
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1404
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 1>one of them got bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought him to the doctor and I'm</v>

1405
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got bit by a rattlesnake and</v>

1406
01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the veterinarians like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1407
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you gonna play me as I'm going to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sad song.</v>

1408
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And the veterinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>

1409
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He lived the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the veterinarian was like,</v>

1410
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything seems okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1412
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure the snake got him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

1413
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1414
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1415
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>if he's acting funny later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

1416
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So I bring them home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our laters face swells up like a fucking</v>

1417
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just took a while for it to kick in.</v>

1418
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was doing the right thing by</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting him to the vet in time.</v>

1419
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna just get them there right</v>

1420
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1421
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I just beat the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it took a while for the venom to</v>

1424
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>like sink into his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took over an hour because I was at</v>

1425
01:03:55.301 --> 01:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>the mention hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was at the veterinarian's</v>

1427
01:03:58.111 --> 01:03:59.820
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1428
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got bit,</v>

1429
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I had them there within 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes.</v>

1430
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vet's looking at items like,</v>

1431
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any marks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any blood.</v>

1432
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no like clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1433
01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>he might have gotten missed or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing might not have gotten even a</v>

1434
01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe got lucky.</v>

1435
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>So I take him home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face just like boom,</v>

1436
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.200

<v Speaker 1>Their face swells up.</v>

1437
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

1438
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it costs thousands of dollars.</v>

1439
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The antivenom,</v>

1440
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 1>they use the antivenom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really expensive just to inject</v>

1441
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:33.540
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thousands of dollars.</v>

1442
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really bad for people that are</v>

1443
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:36.121
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have any money to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and your dog,</v>

1445
01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it's bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking tremendous stress.</v>

1446
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Would they survive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1448
01:04:45.151 --> 01:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dose was five.</v>

1449
01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some dogs,</v>

1450
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>dogs don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.180
<v Speaker 1>But some dogs die from it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1452
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:54.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad for them.</v>

1453
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a place to run my dog like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1454
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>We've got like all streets around this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

1455
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to drive them somewhere,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you take him off leash in those</v>

1458
01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>places?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1459
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you never know what kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dogs are going to run into,</v>

1460
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>or coyotes or angry moms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you</v>

1464
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 2>can go places that are less populated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the best for off-leash type</v>

1465
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would be so happy,</v>

1466
01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>but she's a lab too sweet dogs and wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run and they're not,</v>

1467
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 2>they're not like the kind of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're taking a press</v>

1578
01:10:16.701 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because of the coffee because</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1582
01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:26.450
<v Speaker 2>it's acidic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1583
01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 2>putting the beans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that jazz.</v>

1584
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.980
<v Speaker 2>And that fucks with your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>If you're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many?</v>

1586
01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 2>1212 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was drinking 12 cups of coffee a day.</v>

1587
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an addiction.</v>

1588
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Music for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his stomach.</v>

1589
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I said that's a big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addiction.</v>

1590
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Cops</v>

1591
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:52.550
<v Speaker 6>can make</v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee is highly acidic and it can</v>

1592
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:58.841
<v Speaker 6>stimulate the hyper section.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Secretion of gastric acid.</v>

1593
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Caffeinated coffee has been shown to</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the city acidity to a greater</v>

1594
01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:07.600
<v Speaker 2>degree than either regular coffee or</v>
<v Speaker 2>caffeine alone.</v>

1595
01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 2>So decaffeinated coffee is more acidic</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything,</v>

1596
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 2>which is caffeine and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stimulate</v>

1597
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:19.670
<v Speaker 1>gastric acid secretion and decaffeinated</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee raises serum gastrin levels.</v>

1598
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That back to your wine guy.</v>

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:11.380
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a song to the FIBONACCI</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence had been not cheesy.</v>

1618
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 1>A fibonacci sequence is a mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence.</v>

1619
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is like it goes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero and the next number is one.</v>

1620
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the next time was two and then two</v>

1621
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:27.350
<v Speaker 1>plus one which is three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

1622
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 1>then it keeps going like in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this mathematical progression.</v>

1623
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they had the chord</v>
<v Speaker 1>progression.</v>

1624
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Had the chord progression link up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FIBONACCI sequence.</v>

1625
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking maniac.</v>

1626
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:44.810
<v Speaker 1>But that same sort of attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and obsessing the,</v>

1627
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you know the intricacies of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an applied that to his wine.</v>

1628
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

1629
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 1>What's the label?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A do ceus vineyards could do see us.</v>

1630
01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:58.440
<v Speaker 1>He has an Austin Maria too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a small restaurant.</v>

1632
01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeez that's crazy.</v>

1633
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I think it gave me the food that</v>

1634
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:06.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck oh really guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's where the flu k till he told</v>

1635
01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:07.800
<v Speaker 1>me just got over the flu.</v>

1636
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Oh shit head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was hanging out with him in</v>

1637
01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Vegas and I think that's right when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to catch it and then I had like</v>

1638
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a cough and then it got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little worse and then I really did</v>

1639
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 1>myself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sauna.</v>

1640
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I crank the sauna up the 210 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh relations.</v>

1641
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently too high for people.</v>

1642
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.370
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how high you supposed to go?</v>

1643
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>One 76 to one nineties apparently people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anyway to 20,</v>

1644
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at two 10 for about an hour.</v>

1645
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Not an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how long do you stay in there to 10</v>

1646
01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in to 10 for at least 20 minutes.</v>

1647
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>1515 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1648
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long I did it at two</v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

1649
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>How long has that most of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of times.</v>

1650
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the right benefits,</v>

1651
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.780
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to 20 minutes at 176</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

1652
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It at least twice a week is like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they recommend.</v>

1653
01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you can get to four times</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>

1654
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>You're a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off,</v>

1655
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>what's the main thing it does for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases a bunch of things.</v>

1656
01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does something called,</v>

1657
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it makes your body produce something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called heat shock proteins,</v>

1658
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>which are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which radically reduce inflammation.</v>

1659
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's similar in a lot of ways to cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock proteins that you would get from a</v>

1660
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.550
<v Speaker 1>cryogenic chamber treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1661
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but can I ask a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we showed them question,</v>

1662
01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is inflammation,</v>

1663
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.170
<v Speaker 1>why is anti-inflammatory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

1664
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.620
<v Speaker 1>why is it bad to be inflamed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1665
01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds kind of that's the root</v>

1666
01:14:42.671 --> 01:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>of almost all diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is big,</v>

1667
01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big cause of a lot.</v>

1668
01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Well that was one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this study.</v>

1669
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Norwegian study on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>song and they showed a decrease in</v>

1670
01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 1>mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 40% decrease in mortality,</v>

1671
01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst all causes from people that use</v>

1672
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think three times or four times a</v>

1673
01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:03.790
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1674
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:04.900
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Meaning 40% decrease in stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack,</v>

1676
01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:12.340
<v Speaker 1>all these different various factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they think that that's attributed to</v>

1677
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.590
<v Speaker 1>the heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Rhonda,</v>

1678
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Healy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:19.490
<v Speaker 1>She's the one who got me into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a frequent guest and the podcasts</v>

1680
01:15:19.491 --> 01:15:24.491
<v Speaker 1>and super genius and a San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1682
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

1683
01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:28.330
<v Speaker 1>The coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very cool.</v>

1684
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about,</v>

1685
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:31.480
<v Speaker 1>she was on the Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1686
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was telling me,</v>

1687
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>which you're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians.</v>

1688
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:36.340
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How not to be inflamed.</v>

1689
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your lips are inflamed.</v>

1690
01:15:39.071 --> 01:15:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're not eating anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird?</v>

1691
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 1>No aggressor and what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your butt?</v>

1692
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Your Butt is inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It are you.</v>

1693
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys not getting in the Sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Kim Carney ash and gotten the sauna,</v>

1694
01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 1>she probably starts sweating like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
01:15:54.431 --> 01:15:59.431
<v Speaker 1>like when you bake something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have like a slow cook pork</v>

1696
01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:04.471
<v Speaker 1>roast or something like that and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>all juicy of juice come pop in,</v>

1697
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:06.850
<v Speaker 1>all the top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's putting a tray under to catch the</v>

1698
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 1>drippings.</v>

1699
01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think about all squeezing</v>

1700
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:15.300
<v Speaker 1>all that fat that they pull out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides and then suck in and they pumped</v>

1701
01:16:15.961 --> 01:16:18.310
<v Speaker 1>that stuff in the butt to make the but</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra big.</v>

1702
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 1>And then you put that button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oven and that'll just get juicy.</v>

1703
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Goody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goody and Z.</v>

1704
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what that is some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating is right.</v>

1705
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boil it down.</v>

1706
01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>So the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heat proteins,</v>

1707
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.000
<v Speaker 1>heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>A cyto keens help you with inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1709
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps your body fight off</v>

1710
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and so it doesn't in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural way,</v>

1711
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 1>instead of like nonsteroidal anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatories like Ibuprofen,</v>

1712
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:47.890
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are really bad for your gut</v>

1713
01:16:47.891 --> 01:16:49.910
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really bad for you.</v>

1714
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Like they say that Ibuprofen should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken rare.</v>

1715
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Rarely if ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1716
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's apparently terrible for your body.</v>

1717
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Can cause strokes and it also is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for your,</v>

1718
01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:03.790
<v Speaker 1>your gut flora.</v>

1719
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Cameron Hanes is a ultra</v>

1720
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>marathon runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs,</v>

1721
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 plus miles and he's nutty fucking</v>

1722
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:16.250
<v Speaker 1>things taking Ibuprofen on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

1723
01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got off of it after he listened to the</v>

1724
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Patrick podcasts and all of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>joint pain went away and his joint pain</v>

1725
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:28.760
<v Speaker 1>was literally being caused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was being caused by all is</v>

1726
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was being caused by his taking of the</v>

1727
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased his body's inflammation</v>

1728
01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1729
01:17:38.811 --> 01:17:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy because it damages your</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut bacteria because it's fucking</v>

1730
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taking 800 milligrams this shit</v>

1731
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She body freaks out.</v>

1732
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1733
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you're significantly increasing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk for stroke.</v>

1734
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 1>And I sent him all these studies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>findings on Ibuprofen.</v>

1735
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So he stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets off of it.</v>

1736
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.960
<v Speaker 1>All of his joint pain goes away.</v>

1737
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally causing joint pain.</v>

1738
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 1>So how has your gut connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation?</v>

1739
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why people</v>

1740
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 1>tell you not to eat bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why people tell you not to eat</v>

1741
01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Refined carbohydrates cause</v>

1742
01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that cause it</v>

1743
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>through the gut leakage and what we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed.</v>

1744
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:24.620
<v Speaker 1>What is inflamed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

1745
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that up in a way that a car</v>

1746
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.460
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1747
01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is inflammation?</v>

1748
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going over style from the need</v>

1749
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 1>to know about inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is a defense mechanism in</v>

1750
01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:40.050
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The immune system recognizes damage</v>

1751
01:18:40.051 --> 01:18:40.731
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1752
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:45.731
<v Speaker 1>these fucking cops with the pop up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune system recognizes damage</v>

1753
01:18:47.551 --> 01:18:49.850
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irritants and pathogens.</v>

1754
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And it begins the healing process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When something harmful or irritating</v>

1755
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:54.890
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your body is a biological</v>

1756
01:18:54.891 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 1>response to try to remove it.</v>

1757
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 1>The signs and symptoms of inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be uncomfortable,</v>

1758
01:18:59.061 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but or to show that the body is trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heal itself.</v>

1759
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a constant state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation because you're constantly</v>

1760
01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 1>taking in foods that your body is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to in a very adverse way,</v>

1761
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>that is what causes a lot of diseases on</v>
<v Speaker 1>peep in people.</v>

1762
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:18.910
<v Speaker 1>And it also causes your body to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding certain aspects of gut bacteria,</v>

1763
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just,</v>

1764
01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's you're just not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're putting,</v>

1765
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:29.840
<v Speaker 1>so the body is actually the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fight a disease,</v>

1766
01:19:29.841 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 1>is fighting these foods that come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly these medicines or whatever.</v>

1767
01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foreign things.</v>

1768
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big thing with food's a big thing with</v>

1769
01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see people with puffy faces,</v>

1770
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they get it like permanently pumped up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all soft,</v>

1771
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:45.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's inflamed.</v>

1772
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Gut sticks out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their guts inflamed.</v>

1773
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And is it yourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it your arteries and everything?</v>

1774
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Everything is just pull up the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things.</v>

1775
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of go back to that often the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid.</v>

1776
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1777
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chronic inflammation can eventually</v>

1778
01:20:05.241 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>cause severe t several diseases and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

1779
01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 1>including some cancers and rheumatoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis,</v>

1780
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>infections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounds in any kind of tissue,</v>

1781
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be able to heal itself without</v>

1782
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:18.030
<v Speaker 1>an inflammatory response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So inflammation is a part of the body's</v>

1783
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing is you're,</v>

1784
01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:24.090
<v Speaker 1>you're in a constant state of damage</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating shitty food.</v>

1785
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So if you're constantly eating sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking sodas and fucking corn syrup,</v>

1786
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 1>all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:35.210
<v Speaker 3>You're putting these weird chemicals in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body and your body's freaking out.</v>

1788
01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1789
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1790
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>they're not just making a distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

1791
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation that comes from like a</v>

1792
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>bruising or injury where your body's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to heal itself versus something</v>

1793
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>that's happening internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from,</v>

1794
01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 1>from your consumption of shitty foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this whole crazy many</v>

1795
01:20:54.361 --> 01:20:57.390
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory causing foods that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat on a daily basis.</v>

1796
01:20:57.391 --> 01:21:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And we just think of it as food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pizza,</v>

1797
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 1>pizza's delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1798
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Fucking full of inflammation causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

1799
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

1800
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1801
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:10.150
<v Speaker 3>first of cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bread,</v>

1802
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>the bread's,</v>

1803
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:15.110
<v Speaker 1>which is unfortunately what you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that your bread is sour</v>

1804
01:21:15.111 --> 01:21:17.490
<v Speaker 1>dough bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different because sour dough</v>

1805
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 1>bread apparently has less complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten's in it because,</v>

1806
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:21.983
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1807
01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends,</v>

1808
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1809
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.313
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1810
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.020
<v Speaker 3>have gluten issues that can eat my</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

1811
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 3>not a to access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't bother them the way they</v>

1812
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 3>were processed bread about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about sour dough bread</v>

1813
01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 3>that ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

1814
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.820
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Commercial Yeast,</v>

1815
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.850
<v Speaker 3>the gluten structure is a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>

1816
01:21:41.851 --> 01:21:43.530
<v Speaker 3>a weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1818
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a great documentary that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched recently called what's with</v>

1819
01:21:47.661 --> 01:21:51.380
<v Speaker 1>wheat and it was all about how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed wheat,</v>

1820
01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:54.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make higher yield,</v>

1821
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wi which w you could grow more wheat and</v>

1822
01:21:58.071 --> 01:22:01.280
<v Speaker 1>a shorter area and have a higher yield</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the,</v>

1823
01:22:01.281 --> 01:22:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the gluten's in that wheat are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1824
01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:08.060
<v Speaker 1>they're much more dense and complex then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural wheat that we used to eat</v>

1825
01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:09.910
<v Speaker 1>and 150 plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1826
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:13.720
<v Speaker 3>This bread that you're going to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from this great,</v>

1827
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mill in a Utah that is pure organic</v>

1828
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:24.130
<v Speaker 3>small crops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you won't have a problem with this.</v>

1829
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's like heirloom wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what they call it?</v>

1830
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a thing until maynard.</v>

1831
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who told me about that is they use</v>

1832
01:22:31.331 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 3>heirloom wheat in his pasta and he makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as lost around.</v>

1833
01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for people to Digest.</v>

1834
01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1835
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little more expensive and a</v>

1836
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:41.200
<v Speaker 3>little harder to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

1837
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:43.600
<v Speaker 3>it makes a difference in the flavor is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much better.</v>

1838
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pasta when I rarely eat pasta,</v>

1840
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.150
<v Speaker 1>but I do eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy it from Italy and they have</v>

1841
01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:54.920
<v Speaker 1>heirloom pasta in Italy and just you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel as fucking gross after you</v>

1842
01:22:54.921 --> 01:22:55.340
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

1843
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that brick that,</v>

1844
01:22:57.921 --> 01:23:00.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that punch in the gut that just fucking</v>

1845
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.420
<v Speaker 3>like you ate a bag of rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the,</v>

1846
01:23:02.421 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 3>so the sauna,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it would help,</v>

1849
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:10.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're also dealing with your gut</v>
<v Speaker 1>biome,</v>

1850
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:11.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1851
01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forcing your body to your eating</v>

1852
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:20.341
<v Speaker 1>foods that are going to encourage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of certain types of gut bacteria.</v>

1853
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That live off of sugars and live off of,</v>

1854
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:31.410
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine got the gastro surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo and uh,</v>

1855
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:37.050
<v Speaker 4>she was diabetic and she had the gastro</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing done and her diabetes leveled out</v>

1856
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:43.540
<v Speaker 4>and she said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doctor says because of the bacteria,</v>

1857
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.750
<v Speaker 4>because the something that they did and</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking something out.</v>

1858
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.160
<v Speaker 4>Does this make sense at all?</v>

1859
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1860
01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>she probably had a terrible diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1861
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:53.340
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is also probably one of the</v>

1862
01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:55.260
<v Speaker 1>reasons why she was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1863
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know that there's different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of bacteria.</v>

1864
01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 1>There's different types of diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1865
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:04.590
<v Speaker 1>There's diabetes that has caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely by diet and this diabetes that</v>

1866
01:24:04.591 --> 01:24:09.591
<v Speaker 1>is genetic and the type of diabetes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is caused by diet is reversible.</v>

1867
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It happens with a lot of people that</v>

<v Speaker 3>you were just like a crazy person.</v>

1963
01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not right.</v>

1964
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.650
<v Speaker 8>We're big pants.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pee Fall Dude.</v>

1965
01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:45.590
<v Speaker 8>I saw Kevin Means</v>

<v Speaker 3>19 days funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my friend Diane Derosa Nice.</v>

1967
01:28:51.881 --> 01:28:54.250
<v Speaker 3>She was a friend of mine from high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1968
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to see,</v>

1969
01:28:57.190 --> 01:29:00.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to see him at catch a rising</v>

1970
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 3>star in Cambridge</v>

1971
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I had done an open Mike</v>

1972
01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:09.090
<v Speaker 1>night or maybe I hadn't even gone on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage yet,</v>

1973
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:11.250
<v Speaker 1>but I want to see him and I paid to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1974
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedy,</v>

1975
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>any crushed so hard that I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

1976
01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was unimaginable to me.</v>

1977
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine so it could be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

1978
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was in his prime then and it</v>

1979
01:29:23.911 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1980
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:29.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe 180,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 seat rooms.</v>

1981
01:29:29.091 --> 01:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1982
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 1>just killing ceiling pow and he's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1983
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.120
<v Speaker 1>No escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on fire.</v>

1984
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:38.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1985
01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I opened for him like a</v>

1986
01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:46.600
<v Speaker 4>caroline's when I was first starting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just watching him just like destroy any</v>

1987
01:29:46.601 --> 01:29:50.140
<v Speaker 4>breaks into that coffee song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember he would do the book coffee</v>

1988
01:29:50.141 --> 01:29:52.280
<v Speaker 4>song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this song,</v>

1989
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:54.050
<v Speaker 4>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1990
01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 4>all the coffee in Brazil or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1991
01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just killing talking about it and</v>

1992
01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden he's doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>musical number.</v>

1993
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.020
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1994
01:30:05.021 --> 01:30:07.750
<v Speaker 4>he just saw the coffee and all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee in Brazil.</v>

1995
01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:08.584
<v Speaker 4>I think it's up</v>

1996
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>that he got comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever he wanted to.</v>

1997
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.290
<v Speaker 1>He would set spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a spot that some comedians can</v>

1998
01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:18.260
<v Speaker 1>hit them in the fucking bow tie.</v>

1999
01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:26.760
<v Speaker 8>This is first tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Show them women call me.</v>

2000
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:27.603
<v Speaker 8>Plucky</v>

2001
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to see it to really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>

2002
01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be there in 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2003
01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 1>to realize like how crazy what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing was,</v>

2004
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he got stuck.</v>

2005
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 1>He got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went from being a fucking murderer on</v>

2006
01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:53.010
<v Speaker 1>top of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncle buck healing in every place.</v>

2007
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But he got stuck with his act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had like the same act for the longest</v>

2008
01:30:57.721 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 1>time and that act like it didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2009
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>Well this is cut back to what I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

2010
01:31:02.741 --> 01:31:05.740
<v Speaker 4>It's a bit of taking your eye off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ball and like doing other things.</v>

2011
01:31:05.741 --> 01:31:08.500
<v Speaker 4>He started doing uncle buck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started doing some movies and the</v>

2012
01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Nino at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people weren't so conscious that</v>

2013
01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:15.010
<v Speaker 4>you had to keep your act alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2014
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:19.660
<v Speaker 4>And you know you take five years off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road and then try and come back.</v>

2015
01:31:19.661 --> 01:31:21.400
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not easily done.</v>

2016
01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you take that much time off?</v>

2017
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just ballparking but I mean,</v>

2018
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:28.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his interests were other places at that</v>

2019
01:31:28.971 --> 01:31:31.430
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was doing tv shows and doing all that</v>

2020
01:31:31.431 --> 01:31:32.990
<v Speaker 4>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

2021
01:31:32.991 --> 01:31:36.980
<v Speaker 4>You don't progress because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>just in it doing that stand up all the</v>

2022
01:31:36.981 --> 01:31:37.460
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2023
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Well everyone was told back then in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular that you had to do something</v>

2024
01:31:41.751 --> 01:31:45.260
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stand up was a vehicle that got you</v>

2025
01:31:45.261 --> 01:31:50.261
<v Speaker 1>to the big game and the big game was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>television show or a movie.</v>

2026
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Like when I got news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the producers of news radio said</v>

2027
01:31:53.871 --> 01:31:56.120
<v Speaker 1>to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you still doing standup?</v>

2028
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an actor now,</v>

2029
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2030
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.730
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On TV.</v>

2031
01:31:58.730 --> 01:32:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I was what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2033
01:32:01.811 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I got to get to a comedy club right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this makes any sense.</v>

2034
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I know the fuck you talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2035
01:32:07.461 --> 01:32:11.720
<v Speaker 4>the way we think is you do that stuff so</v>
<v Speaker 4>more people come to see your show so you</v>

2036
01:32:11.721 --> 01:32:14.630
<v Speaker 4>can keep doing your shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you do that stuff.</v>

2037
01:32:14.631 --> 01:32:16.110
<v Speaker 4>It's not the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

2038
01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:21.140
<v Speaker 4>that generation saw it as the standup</v>
<v Speaker 4>was not something that you buy,</v>

2039
01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:26.300
<v Speaker 4>but also to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have theater shows and other</v>

2040
01:32:26.301 --> 01:32:28.580
<v Speaker 4>avenues weren't kind of carved out where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>

2041
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:30.890
<v Speaker 4>could see stand up as being a special</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2042
01:32:30.891 --> 01:32:35.891
<v Speaker 4>They were just in these hard ass clubs</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing six shows a weekend and it's true.</v>

2043
01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.060
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get me Outta here.</v>

2044
01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.490
<v Speaker 4>When did theater shows start kicking in</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people?</v>

2045
01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.110
<v Speaker 4>For the main,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like just regular good comics,</v>

2046
01:32:45.111 --> 01:32:45.944
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2047
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:47.340
<v Speaker 4>fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2048
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Was it?</v>

2049
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 4>Who else was doing theaters before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know in those days?</v>

2050
01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Well there was Kevin meaney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Kevin Meeney was peaking now he would</v>

2051
01:32:57.831 --> 01:32:59.840
<v Speaker 4>be running off and starting to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>theater shows.</v>

2052
01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:04.841
<v Speaker 4>But back then it was just comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then television.</v>

2053
01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some people did big places cause I</v>

2054
01:33:07.881 --> 01:33:11.180
<v Speaker 2>saw people in big places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of places?</v>

2055
01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was theaters,</v>

2056
01:33:14.150 --> 01:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely rock clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some of it,</v>

2057
01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.050
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't like an active touring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the first time,</v>

2058
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.090
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember the first time I</v>

2059
01:33:23.091 --> 01:33:23.924
<v Speaker 2>did a theater.</v>

2060
01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:27.630
<v Speaker 4>Not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

2061
01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like part of the touring</v>

2062
01:33:31.681 --> 01:33:33.540
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you had guys that were big,</v>

2063
01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.100
<v Speaker 4>they were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't like,</v>

2064
01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't have a guy that instead of</v>

2065
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:40.770
<v Speaker 4>headlining at a club could just go off</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do</v>

2066
01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:44.520
<v Speaker 4>another little theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was different.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2068
01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:48.320

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2069
01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:49.680
<v Speaker 4>like all the clubs were closing</v>

<v Speaker 2>you started right when it hit right at</v>

2079
01:34:08.411 --> 01:34:12.250
<v Speaker 2>the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I started at the tail end of the</v>

2080
01:34:12.251 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The boom was like 84 and when he started</v>

2081
01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>in [inaudible] 88 okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I started,</v>

2082
01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2083
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:21.010
<v Speaker 2>you started about four years to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

2085
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was still plenty of work.</v>

2086
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>

2087
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:29.560
<v Speaker 2>When I shut up clubs at 93 it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a get discouraged.</v>

2088
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it was good for me because all the</v>

2089
01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:33.660
<v Speaker 4>guys' wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2090
01:34:33.661 --> 01:34:35.490
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was there.</v>

2091
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.520
<v Speaker 4>I was working for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't looking to make money.</v>

2092
01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I was just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:43.950
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden I was able to just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had a car and would drive the</v>

2094
01:34:43.951 --> 01:34:46.440
<v Speaker 4>headline or a club you could get on</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

2095
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Well there was also this weird attitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some people would have that land,</v>

2096
01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.700
<v Speaker 2>like they were getting screwed because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work was going away.</v>

2097
01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were getting screwed.</v>

2098
01:34:55.141 --> 01:34:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking like,</v>

2099
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a way of looking</v>

2100
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.190
<v Speaker 3>at things that as that you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>personally getting screwed.</v>

2101
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this entire industry was</v>

2102
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 3>oversaturated with a bunch of hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hacks.</v>

2103
01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:07.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2104
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Real has someone was talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 3>there going to be a bus now?</v>

2105
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Because there's been so much comedy out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and stuff.</v>

2106
01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not a dearth of shitty comedy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of comedy,</v>

2107
01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot of good comedy that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressing and moving forward.</v>

2108
01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.950
<v Speaker 3>The art for a lot of booming different</v>
<v Speaker 3>voices,</v>

2109
01:35:24.951 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2110
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:32.530
<v Speaker 3>there was a bust back then for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had 40 minutes of material and</v>

2111
01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 3>they just pounded people with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>relentlessly and they never wrote and</v>

2112
01:35:37.071 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 3>they never were traveling constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was shitty.</v>

2113
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of these formula</v>

2114
01:35:43.331 --> 01:35:45.400
<v Speaker 1>guys that would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2115
01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just have some fucking like</v>

2116
01:35:48.131 --> 01:35:53.131
<v Speaker 1>really obvious premise and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>work at like a comedian,</v>

2117
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 3>say they had a way of talking him like</v>
<v Speaker 3>her comedian.</v>

2118
01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:03.470
<v Speaker 3>What is this mutual of Omaha's wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>kingdom playing out in my kitchen.</v>

2119
01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Cause you said it was really funny for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

2121
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Something's happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're French comics are getting exposed</v>

2122
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:18.610
<v Speaker 1>for stealing American comedy verbatim</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and,</v>

2123
01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:20.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and translating to fringe like,</v>

2124
01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 1>and there was a video that came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>today that showed Dave Chappelle and</v>

2125
01:36:25.521 --> 01:36:29.210
<v Speaker 1>then some French comic ripping them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Seinfeld and then some French</v>

2126
01:36:29.211 --> 01:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>comic rick ripping them off or ripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>them off with the same hand motions.</v>

2127
01:36:34.011 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 1>The same doing his act in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing exact and French as if they</v>

2128
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 1>were the only human beings who spoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>both English and French.</v>

2129
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:46.810
<v Speaker 1>This was something that we had heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>about forever from the Montreal Comedy</v>

2130
01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:47.751
<v Speaker 1>Festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2131
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Montreal comedy festival,</v>

2132
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:53.960
<v Speaker 1>not the people that perform there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would perform in Montreal and we</v>

2133
01:36:53.961 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 1>would talk to guys who were comics</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2134
01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that spoke English and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2135
01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the guys that spoke French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they would tell you they did</v>

2136
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:03.480
<v Speaker 1>French shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

2139
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you do French shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English shows and they go,</v>

2140
01:37:07.371 --> 01:37:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

2141
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of comics that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous only in the French speaking world</v>

2142
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:17.600
<v Speaker 1>of touring comedy and they just steal</v>
<v Speaker 1>from American comics and just say their</v>

2171
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talking with,</v>

2172
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:37.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2173
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you were talking about a Jannie.</v>

2174
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.171
<v Speaker 3>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenny.</v>

2175
01:38:40.171 --> 01:38:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who I love Jenny too.</v>

2176
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 3>One of the greats and then I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>underrated comedian of all time.</v>

2177
01:38:45.781 --> 01:38:46.531
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2178
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when you listened to his stuff,</v>

2179
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 3>the it is very much of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think are all comedy is very much of</v>

2180
01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2181
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:59.910
<v Speaker 3>It really like even our stuff from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was of that moment.</v>

2183
01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.640

<v Speaker 3>but he's definitely have that ear.</v>

2185
01:39:09.391 --> 01:39:12.300

<v Speaker 2>but it's weird to watch.</v>

2366
01:47:53.541 --> 01:47:57.910
<v Speaker 2>So it was her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you love to go back in time and</v>

2367
01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:04.020
<v Speaker 2>bang some hot lady from 1962</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it was different back then.</v>

2368
01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When was birth control?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a birth control come out?</v>

2370
01:48:09.370 --> 01:48:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Sixties so I feel like that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people changed what they are because</v>

2371
01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.310
<v Speaker 2>back then there was this mad desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2372
01:48:18.311 --> 01:48:21.940
<v Speaker 2>But there was also insane consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had sex with somebody,</v>

2373
01:48:21.941 --> 01:48:22.331
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2374
01:48:22.331 --> 01:48:24.670
<v Speaker 2>we met him again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get mad of a person.</v>

2375
01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

2376
01:48:25.661 --> 01:48:26.494
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2377
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.630
<v Speaker 2>this drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this poll,</v>

2378
01:48:28.631 --> 01:48:32.890
<v Speaker 2>this cyclone of lust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leads you to this one person.</v>

2379
01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Ramifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just ramifications,</v>

2380
01:48:35.501 --> 01:48:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but life changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life altering results in consequences.</v>

2381
01:48:39.521 --> 01:48:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the bill comes in,</v>

2382
01:48:41.231 --> 01:48:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you have the sexual revolution.</v>

2383
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.370
<v Speaker 2>He was started bagging everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weirdness.</v>

2384
01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Women were in control of their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>

2385
01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just w what changed what it means to</v>

2386
01:48:51.401 --> 01:48:52.670
<v Speaker 2>have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's we,</v>

2387
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:55.060
<v Speaker 2>it became this weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became for pleasure.</v>

2388
01:48:55.090 --> 01:48:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just to,</v>

2389
01:48:56.201 --> 01:48:57.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was always for pleasure,</v>

2390
01:48:57.911 --> 01:49:01.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's always for pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the odds of that pleasure biting you</v>

2391
01:49:01.331 --> 01:49:02.240
<v Speaker 2>in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2392
01:49:02.241 --> 01:49:07.120
<v Speaker 2>and people must have just assumed you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have a few babies mamas by the</v>

2393
01:49:07.121 --> 01:49:09.160
<v Speaker 2>time we got to a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2394
01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:13.090
<v Speaker 2>But as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a baby out of wedlock,</v>

2395
01:49:13.091 --> 01:49:15.070
<v Speaker 2>you were ostracized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.630
<v Speaker 2>You were seen as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2397
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.430
<v Speaker 2>bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

2398
01:49:18.431 --> 01:49:19.061
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:49:19.061 --> 01:49:22.630
<v Speaker 2>You were seeing the guy who wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing,</v>

2400
01:49:22.631 --> 01:49:24.550
<v Speaker 2>no reflection on Amie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even in the picture.</v>

2401
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.780
<v Speaker 2>She's just like a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck what a shit deal for women.</v>

2402
01:49:28.781 --> 01:49:29.890
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:33.580
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2404
01:49:33.581 --> 01:49:38.560
<v Speaker 2>But there's some people that argue that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pill and that changing the nature of</v>

2405
01:49:38.561 --> 01:49:41.590
<v Speaker 2>sexual intercourse change the way women</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with men,</v>

2406
01:49:41.591 --> 01:49:46.360
<v Speaker 2>which changed the way women sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>view themselves.</v>

2407
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:48.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:53.730
<v Speaker 1>This is not necessarily all positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was found out to be confusing argument</v>

2409
01:49:55.950 --> 01:49:56.590
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2410
01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:59.810
<v Speaker 1>the argument being that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2411
01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>like that it's natural for a woman to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very selective about who she had sex</v>

2412
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:08.860
<v Speaker 1>with and that it's natural for a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2413
01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:11.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want a guy who's getting his shit</v>

2414
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>together and all these different factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in place before she allows demand to</v>

2415
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>procreate with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the pill comes along and then</v>

2416
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:24.520
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden women could just have</v>
<v Speaker 1>one night stands and they could be like</v>

2417
01:50:24.521 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 1>the chicks from sex and the city and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2418
01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.170
<v Speaker 1>just bang up a storm and have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences but like a guy.</v>

2419
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this led to like a deeply</v>

2420
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:40.810
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilling narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never a lot of women sort of found</v>

2421
01:50:40.811 --> 01:50:43.660
<v Speaker 1>themselves repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's a very tortured conversation</v>

2422
01:50:43.661 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not a woman because I don't</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to meet her and my kids were little.</v>

2553
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's really nailing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we take a picture and she's like,</v>

2558
01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:04.770

2559
01:57:04.771 --> 01:57:07.170
<v Speaker 2>pictures with these two little people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2560
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:11.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the price he has to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What ticket for a whole day he'll be</v>

2561
01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.550
<v Speaker 2>squatting down and taking pictures with</v>
<v Speaker 2>little people.</v>

2562
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for the lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the squatting and posing.</v>

2563
01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:20.550
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2564
01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:21.690
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2565
01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:25.620
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people got mad that cause we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

2566
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:30.650
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about that Logan Paul</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy who had taken a photo or videos with</v>

2567
01:57:31.591 --> 01:57:33.320
<v Speaker 2>dead people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the math side,</v>

2568
01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:35.910
<v Speaker 2>the way we were discussing the Logan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul thing,</v>

2569
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.110
<v Speaker 2>people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I defended him.</v>

2570
01:57:37.110 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I defended him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I?</v>

2571
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2572
01:57:40.411 --> 01:57:44.610
<v Speaker 2>We were high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was me and a red band wearing NASA</v>

2573
01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 2>outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't take it seriously by the way.</v>

2574
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read into it more.</v>

2575
01:57:51.601 --> 01:57:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know exactly what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I run into more,</v>

2576
01:57:53.551 --> 01:57:55.980
<v Speaker 2>apparently he was mocking the body's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's people's,</v>

2577
01:57:55.981 --> 01:57:59.340
<v Speaker 2>like their hands were bloated and blue</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was making fun of it all.</v>

2578
01:57:59.341 --> 01:58:03.550
<v Speaker 2>And so he's a bad guy apparently the</v>
<v Speaker 2>super cut of like everything he did and</v>

2579
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.640
<v Speaker 2>he did a bunch of other things on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2580
01:58:05.641 --> 01:58:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's this thing and aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's a creep.</v>

2581
01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:11.880
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to be outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get attention.</v>

2582
01:58:11.881 --> 01:58:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was working.</v>

2583
01:58:13.111 --> 01:58:15.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got a ton of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the same thing though,</v>

2584
01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:17.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these people that you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

2589
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.400

<v Speaker 2>and hate him equally.</v>

2594
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:44.140
<v Speaker 2>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even the people that hate him still</v>

2595
01:58:44.141 --> 01:58:46.210
<v Speaker 2>have to see what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that kind of thing.</v>

2596
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:32.050
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluffy would never do that,</v>

2652
02:01:32.630 --> 02:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flat fees.</v>

2653
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see a feather in its full well</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2654
02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 2>You know Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2655
02:01:42.711 --> 02:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>my cat drops road and all in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>children's hair while they sleep</v>

2656
02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.940
<v Speaker 2>in her bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2657
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Dropped a rat in my daughter's bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a leak in her shower cap.</v>

2658
02:01:57.650 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Really to mark his territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the rat was just scared shitless and</v>

2659
02:02:02.361 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 2>was running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't still behind the toilet and</v>

2660
02:02:05.391 --> 02:02:09.710
<v Speaker 2>stuff and we finally got it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might to the next day it goes to put</v>

2661
02:02:09.711 --> 02:02:14.200
<v Speaker 2>on a shower cap and it's just filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with p rat rat pee.</v>

2662
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fucking die from the</v>

2663
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:22.190
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that you can get leprosy from</v>

2664
02:02:22.191 --> 02:02:23.960
<v Speaker 2>armadillos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2665
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.780
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's one of the few,</v>

2666
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:32.090
<v Speaker 2>one of the few ways that a human can</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract leprosy from an animal</v>

2667
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:36.590
<v Speaker 2>leprosies apparently is 95% of us are</v>
<v Speaker 2>immune to leprosy.</v>

2668
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:40.550
<v Speaker 2>But you can get leprosy from Armadillo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2669
02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you eat an Armadillo,</v>

2670
02:02:42.201 --> 02:02:44.480
<v Speaker 2>cook the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Folks wear rubber gloves.</v>

2671
02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.770
<v Speaker 2>How armadillos can spread leprosy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dinosaur too,</v>

2672
02:02:48.771 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tank,</v>

2673
02:02:50.331 --> 02:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>like creatures are the only mammals</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides us known to carry leprosy.</v>

2674
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh my Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
02:02:55.791 --> 02:02:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Apparently though those things taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

2676
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:00.560
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2677
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>people eat armadillos speak to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:03:02.831 --> 02:03:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They opened him up and it's kind of a</v>

2679
02:03:04.911 --> 02:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>fatty meat grill it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2680
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:11.570
<v Speaker 2>people marinate it and grill it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking your head.</v>

2681
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean why is a lobster delicious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things gross because it walks on</v>

2682
02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>the road cause he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he its beady eyes at night when you're</v>

2683
02:03:19.461 --> 02:03:22.190
<v Speaker 2>driving to vegas capable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it dear delicious then?</v>

2684
02:03:22.191 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause deers walking the road to they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as delicious dear.</v>

2685
02:03:26.090 --> 02:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like dear so much.</v>

2686
02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2687
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 2>you like to cooking it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2688
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you eat and elk?</v>

2689
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a deer elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant elk.</v>

2690
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 2>A giant elk is a giant deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is different though?</v>

2691
02:03:35.901 --> 02:03:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had deer in a long time when I</v>

2692
02:03:39.531 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to cook.</v>

2693
02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Well also it's how people take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a big issue.</v>

2694
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:46.760
<v Speaker 2>There's things called tarsal glands that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>

2695
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:50.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the deer's legs that are particularly</v>

2696
02:03:50.091 --> 02:03:52.940
<v Speaker 2>active when they're horny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when a lot of times when you</v>

2697
02:03:52.941 --> 02:03:56.930
<v Speaker 2>hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called the Rut and those Tarsa</v>

2698
02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Glenn's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not handled correctly while</v>

2699
02:03:58.671 --> 02:04:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you're skinning the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can leak some of that stuff on the</v>

2700
02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:06.020
<v Speaker 2>meat and it'll greatly taint the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat tastes.</v>

2701
02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I had some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

2702
02:04:08.661 --> 02:04:11.060
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also people don't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of it.</v>

2703
02:04:11.061 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Like from the moment they kill it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how long does it take before it's</v>

2704
02:04:14.181 --> 02:04:17.600
<v Speaker 2>actually cooled down and dressed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was like in New Jersey,</v>

2705
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure nothing was being done</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

2706
02:04:19.521 --> 02:04:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing was done right.</v>

2707
02:04:21.001 --> 02:04:24.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done right there.</v>

2708
02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Born and raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly who killed it will party</v>

2709
02:04:27.381 --> 02:04:29.300
<v Speaker 2>an ease and any born in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2710
02:04:29.301 --> 02:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I was born in passaic.</v>

2714
02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:36.200
<v Speaker 2>It probably is a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2715
02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 2>they were really,</v>

2718
02:04:41.221 --> 02:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>now because the new governor has decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop bear hunting.</v>

2719
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Brown bear per capita in the country.</v>

02:05:41.981 --> 02:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>These two giant bears battling it out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>far rockaway where they tackle over each</v>

2739

<v Speaker 1>It was the fight for access to these</v>

2744
02:06:01.061 --> 02:06:03.280
<v Speaker 1>areas where these people drop their</v>

02:06:19.541 --> 02:06:24.190
<v Speaker 1>decided he has his ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to the bear hunt.</v>

2752
02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Even though the bear hunt in New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like really strictly controlled by</v>

<v Speaker 1>populations healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was also the situation that</v>

<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2765
02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:00.490
<v Speaker 4>He was doing probably phone calls to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear's den</v>

2766
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:05.500
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got your daughter down here.</v>

2767
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:08.140
<v Speaker 4>She's really drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

2768
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So the wildlife biologist put a number</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2769
02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bears can be healthy and conflicts</v>

2770
02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:17.610
<v Speaker 1>with people can be reduced if we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
02:07:17.611 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the bears reduced to shutting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not an issue of,</v>

2772
02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:22.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in danger.</v>

2773
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Ranger not endangered in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

2774
02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're over abundant.</v>

2775
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a problem with people with</v>

2776
02:07:30.061 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to bears or what my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella likes to call charismatic</v>

2777
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>megafauna and their people look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and they anthropomorphize them</v>

2778
02:07:38.981 --> 02:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>and start thinking of them as being Yogi</v>
<v Speaker 1>and booboo and our little friends that</v>

2779
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>live in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize like these are no,</v>

2780
02:07:46.421 --> 02:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>these are animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2781
02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:48.161
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

2782
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:53.161
<v Speaker 1>you can't have animals there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant predators and close proximity to</v>

2783
02:07:53.351 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 1>human beings without monitoring and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having wildlife biologists,</v>

2784
02:07:58.090 --> 02:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>stoic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

2785
02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:05.490
<v Speaker 1>objective people who really understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals tell you exactly how many there</v>

2786
02:08:05.531 --> 02:08:07.810
<v Speaker 1>should be in this area and when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a problem.</v>

2787
02:08:07.810 --> 02:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're going to have an issue in</v>

2788
02:08:09.791 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey the same way they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an issue in British Columbia.</v>

2789
02:08:13.001 --> 02:08:17.050
<v Speaker 1>They outlawed Grizzly bear hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia this year for the exact</v>

2790
02:08:17.051 --> 02:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2791
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And they did it in British Columbia</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not endangered.</v>

2792
02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:23.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2793
02:08:23.311 --> 02:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a ton of them.</v>

2794
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they not endangered,</v>

2795
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 1>but the people that voted on it are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that live in Vancouver where</v>

2796
02:08:29.051 --> 02:08:31.990
<v Speaker 1>there are new grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Vancouver,</v>

2797
02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:35.740
<v Speaker 1>even though it's the population center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a British Columbia,</v>

2798
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 1>it's where all the people live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by no means representative of what</v>

2799
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>most of British Columbia looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a British Columbia's woods forest.</v>

2800
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And those people have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grizzly bears,</v>

2801
02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they said they're not allowed to hunt</v>

2802
02:08:50.591 --> 02:08:52.120
<v Speaker 1>them at all and a lot of them anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2803
02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And so also it's a big part of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy because there's a lot of these</v>

2804
02:08:55.841 --> 02:08:59.200
<v Speaker 1>people that made a living by guiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on these grizzly bear hunts.</v>

2805
02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's gonna also devastate the</v>

2806
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:06.560
<v Speaker 1>economy when it comes to their moose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk hunting populations too.</v>

2807
02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of people went there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose hunt,</v>

2808
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:11.440
<v Speaker 1>elk hunt and deer hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bears.</v>

2809
02:09:11.441 --> 02:09:13.180
<v Speaker 1>So why did the populations are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up.</v>

2810
02:09:13.181 --> 02:09:16.240
<v Speaker 1>The bears are going to start eating more</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose and elk and deer.</v>

2811
02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So what's their reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal rights activists have been</v>

2812
02:09:20.681 --> 02:09:24.550
<v Speaker 1>infiltrated the government and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are like leaning left and</v>

2813
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:27.640
<v Speaker 1>have sort of a delusional perception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what wildlife is.</v>

2814
02:09:27.970 --> 02:09:32.320
<v Speaker 1>They've decided to push these laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that people didn't vote on.</v>

2815
02:09:32.321 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not like something,</v>

2816
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:37.180
<v Speaker 1>there was this giant statewide vote and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people decided to end grizzly bear</v>

2817
02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:38.140
<v Speaker 1>hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2818
02:09:38.141 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy about the Jersey thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it he just gotten an office and the bear</v>

2819
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>problems this years it's been a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's while you're hunting.</v>

2820
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are doing it for the</v>

2821
02:09:51.461 --> 02:09:53.590
<v Speaker 1>right reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're wrong,</v>

2822
02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing it for the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

2823
02:09:55.151 --> 02:09:58.000
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it because they think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting's cruel and they're doing it</v>

2824
02:09:58.001 --> 02:10:01.810
<v Speaker 1>because they think that these are trophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunts and that people that there's no,</v>

2825
02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>there was no merit to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they don't understand is you're</v>

2826
02:10:05.111 --> 02:10:08.920
<v Speaker 1>probably going to have to hire people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill these bears anyway,</v>

2827
02:10:08.921 --> 02:10:10.930
<v Speaker 1>which is what we do in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2828
02:10:10.931 --> 02:10:15.610
<v Speaker 1>California Mountain Lion hunting was</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlawed in the 1990s but since then</v>

2829
02:10:15.611 --> 02:10:18.370
<v Speaker 1>they spent millions of dollars killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions every year.</v>

2830
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not millions every year.</v>

2831
02:10:20.321 --> 02:10:24.280
<v Speaker 1>But what they sell downs overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crew to go get a send out professional</v>

2832
02:10:24.281 --> 02:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>hunters with dogs usually to go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem mountain lions and the ones that</v>

2833
02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:32.290
<v Speaker 1>go after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them have pets and their</v>

2834
02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 1>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2835
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hey dogs.</v>

2836
02:10:37.190 --> 02:10:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:10:37.890 --> 02:10:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of their diet.</v>

2838
02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to control.</v>

2839
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2840
02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2841
02:10:46.130 --> 02:10:47.840
<v Speaker 1>we're in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2842
02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:51.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's not their world anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like it's not,</v>

2843
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't where the fucking dinosaurs</v>

2844
02:10:53.961 --> 02:10:56.540
<v Speaker 1>live either stupid or we build homes all</v>
<v Speaker 1>through here.</v>

2845
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And right now we live here and I'm more</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about us than I am with a God</v>

2847
02:11:01.131 --> 02:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>damn mountain lions in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just ate fluffy mountain lions.</v>

2848
02:11:04.551 --> 02:11:05.540
<v Speaker 1>You say fluffy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

2849
02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Are there a lot of mountain lions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is it the number is big or</v>

2850
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>California has good numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2851
02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:15.470
<v Speaker 1>My friend works at to hone ranch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have it to hone ranch just outside</v>

2852
02:11:15.471 --> 02:11:17.270
<v Speaker 1>of Bakersfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you went about an hour and a half</v>

2853
02:11:17.271 --> 02:11:19.070
<v Speaker 1>from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have a,</v>

2854
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was called trail camera.</v>

2855
02:11:21.110 --> 02:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a post out in front of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2856
02:11:24.190 --> 02:11:27.350
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pond and out of this one pond they got</v>

2857
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 1>pictures of 16 different mountain lines.</v>

2858
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever run into him when you go up</v>

2859
02:11:32.501 --> 02:11:33.530
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>

2860
02:11:33.531 --> 02:11:36.350
<v Speaker 1>your runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen mountain lions twice in my</v>

2861
02:11:36.351 --> 02:11:40.220
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One I saw in Colorado and one I saw in</v>

2862
02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one in Montecito in a car.</v>

2863
02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was driving,</v>

2864
02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had tunes on,</v>

2865
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.900
<v Speaker 1>it was listening to Miley Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the car and I saw this thing</v>

2866
02:11:53.181 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was running across the road and know,</v>

2867
02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this big thick bouncy tail.</v>

2868
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2869
02:12:01.791 --> 02:12:03.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized a,</v>

2870
02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

2871
02:12:06.370 --> 02:12:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking at something for a</v>

2872
02:12:08.271 --> 02:12:10.880
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two seconds maximum,</v>

2873
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'll find the cat.</v>

2874
02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:16.430
<v Speaker 1>What do you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

2875
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ wildlife camera catches</v>

2876
02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>uncolored mountain lion roaming the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills.</v>

2877
02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:23.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hardly working.</v>

2884
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2885
02:12:44.841 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like something you'd see on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Safari.</v>

02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

2888
02:12:50.690 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 1>this is a halloween 2017 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craze.</v>

2889
02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That is our uncolored mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

2890
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it means they don't even know where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one game for.</v>

2891
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the Hollywood hills.</v>

2892
02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:05.030
<v Speaker 1>That's like right next to people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>

2893
02:13:05.090 --> 02:13:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stick my dog to a dog park up there.</v>

2894
02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:10.430
<v Speaker 1>A dog park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a awful laurel one.</v>

2895
02:13:10.431 --> 02:13:12.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a dog park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a at the top of Laurel,</v>

2896
02:13:12.801 --> 02:13:13.690
<v Speaker 1>like right when you go dead.</v>

2897
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:16.100
<v Speaker 1>If you coming up over studio city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go down,</v>

2898
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a dog park out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the right and one of the,</v>

2899
02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:22.880
<v Speaker 1>they had a big sign there that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be on the lookout for mountain lions.</v>

2900
02:13:22.881 --> 02:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>If mountain lions attack you fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2901
02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:25.620
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2902
02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:27.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck am I looking at here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

2903
02:13:28.330 --> 02:13:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here to Hollywood,</v>

2904
02:13:32.110 --> 02:13:36.870
<v Speaker 1>my dog taking my dog to the park and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of see some girls and throw the</v>

2905
02:13:36.871 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>ball around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

2906
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:43.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that is just because of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude about these animals and that's</v>

2907
02:13:43.891 --> 02:13:46.410
<v Speaker 1>also why you see very few deer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

2908
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:51.530
<v Speaker 1>So there's like pros and cons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pro is you very rarely get in</v>

2909
02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:56.530
<v Speaker 1>accidents with deer like Eww,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so uncommon in California.</v>

2910
02:13:56.531 --> 02:13:58.170
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because of mountain lions.</v>

2911
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I always figured they just weren't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous to the area.</v>

2912
02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

2913
02:14:02.551 --> 02:14:04.530
<v Speaker 1>They used to be way more of them when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>first moved here.</v>

2914
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:05.371
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2915
02:14:05.371 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I moved,</v>

2916
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I moved to the valley in 94 and I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer all the time.</v>

2917
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.780
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem in the Hollywood hills all the</v>

2918
02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a deer here.</v>

2919
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him a couple of days ago out in</v>

2920
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>thousand oaks area here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2921
02:14:24.210 --> 02:14:28.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're very rare in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere else like this?</v>

2922
02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in long island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2923
02:14:31.251 --> 02:14:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Highland is a giant problem with deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2924
02:14:34.081 --> 02:14:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higher snipers go take care of them.</v>

2925
02:14:36.811 --> 02:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

2926
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:40.620
<v Speaker 1>They're all over New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt like a pass everywhere.</v>

2927
02:14:40.650 --> 02:14:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like mosquitoes because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any predators like mountain lions</v>

2928
02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:47.030
<v Speaker 1>or coyotes or very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few coyotes.</v>

2929
02:14:47.031 --> 02:14:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And the natural order is why we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see him.</v>

2930
02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because here they've kind of got a</v>

2931
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:54.030
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that point is you can let the</v>

2932
02:14:54.031 --> 02:14:56.160
<v Speaker 1>mountain lines take care of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

2933
02:14:56.220 --> 02:15:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And then when the mountain lions come</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a problem,</v>

2934
02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:02.460
<v Speaker 1>when they've come problem that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get something called the depredation</v>

2935
02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:07.140
<v Speaker 1>permit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a woman got in the Malibu</v>

2936
02:15:07.141 --> 02:15:12.141
<v Speaker 1>mountains because she ran an Alpaca farm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these mountain lion one mountain</v>

2937
02:15:12.601 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 1>lion killed like I think 10 or 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>alpacas and a goat.</v>

2938
02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one session and one session.</v>

2939
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And it was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we were talking about cats</v>

2940
02:15:22.021 --> 02:15:23.200
<v Speaker 1>with house cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just canceled.</v>

2941
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It just killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] me.</v>

2942
02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>She had a good old time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2943
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll pack a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't help himself,</v>

2944
02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Jack and all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when this woman got a depredation</v>

2945
02:15:34.531 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 1>permit to kill the mountain line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got a ton of death threats from</v>

2946
02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:39.180
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2947
02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:40.320
<v Speaker 1>They were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking bitch.</v>

2948
02:15:40.321 --> 02:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You touch that cat.</v>

2949
02:15:41.881 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

2950
02:15:42.931 --> 02:15:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2951
02:15:44.311 --> 02:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>she felt very exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who were,</v>

2952
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 1>she were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew where her farm was.</v>

2953
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2954
02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fuck.</v>

2955
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get really nutty,</v>

2956
02:15:53.671 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to animals,</v>

2957
02:15:55.710 --> 02:15:59.010
<v Speaker 1>they get a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certain animals,</v>

2958
02:15:59.070 --> 02:16:01.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these people have this weird thing</v>

2959
02:16:01.381 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 1>about that squirrel and then the cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>came along,</v>

2960
02:16:04.711 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 1>killed that fucking scroll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what bitch?</v>

2961
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:08.540
<v Speaker 1>You've been feeding that cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2962
02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.720
<v Speaker 1>That's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made that monster and you let that</v>

2963
02:16:12.721 --> 02:16:15.210
<v Speaker 1>thing roam around outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

2964
02:16:15.211 --> 02:16:17.940
<v Speaker 1>you're asking for it to kill everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>it runs into.</v>

2965
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what they do.</v>

2966
02:16:19.610 --> 02:16:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably super charged up about</v>

2967
02:16:21.661 --> 02:16:24.990
<v Speaker 1>it too because he gets to do it all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the pride in front of it's</v>

2968
02:16:24.991 --> 02:16:26.730
<v Speaker 1>family to do it for the family.</v>

2969
02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:28.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what they like the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2970
02:16:28.231 --> 02:16:32.380
<v Speaker 1>That cat did that in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what he wants you to see.</v>

2971
02:16:32.410 --> 02:16:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at me.</v>

2972

<v Speaker 1>It's so great.</v>

2993
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I figured fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2994

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>

2995
02:17:21.010 --> 02:17:23.520

<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what would I do right?</v>

2998
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2999
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I think I could do whatever I want to</v>

<v Speaker 1>is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3015
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you can go to the gym and get annoyed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just work out here.</v>

3016
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Just come on by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the sauna?</v>

3018
02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:28.840
<v Speaker 1>The Sauna and then in a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3019
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:30.280
<v Speaker 1>You could for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3020
02:18:30.281 --> 02:18:33.310
<v Speaker 1>If you have the room for it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have varying sizes of Saunas that they</v>

3021
02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:34.270
<v Speaker 1>did a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:18:34.271 --> 02:18:36.700
<v Speaker 1>That is pretty quite honestly that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one's too big for me.</v>

3023
02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've only gone in Indian by</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

3024
02:18:38.470 --> 02:18:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3025
02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:41.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have couple people in there in</v>

3026
02:18:41.531 --> 02:18:43.480
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of that one was,</v>

3027
02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 1>what was that room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a closet before that we</v>

3028
02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:48.370
<v Speaker 1>turned it into a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3029
02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:49.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3030
02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just decided like this is a spot like</v>

3031
02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:55.503
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3032
02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it there.</v>

3033
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Can you just run that size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3034
02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And apparently they make them all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different sizes,</v>

3035
02:19:01.041 --> 02:19:01.940
<v Speaker 1>so they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3036
02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fit perfect,</v>

3037
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.470
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

3038
02:19:05.471 --> 02:19:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3039
02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:10.960
<v Speaker 1>tendinitis in my elbow and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really been kind of annoying.</v>

3040
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It's really been Bob 10 to nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird one man.</v>

3041
02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And have you ever gotten it before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3042
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they called Golf Golfer's elbow,</v>

3043
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the inside where tennis elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside.</v>

3044
02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It's been annoying me for a few months</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and uh,</v>

3045
02:19:25.511 --> 02:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>it comes from a overdoing chin up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing too many chin ups and I</v>

3046
02:19:30.351 --> 02:19:33.320
<v Speaker 1>was being a meathead where I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing through,</v>

3047
02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would start to annoy me and I</v>

3048
02:19:36.011 --> 02:19:37.580
<v Speaker 1>would just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3049
02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But one session in the sauna</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly reduced like the pain in</v>

3050
02:19:44.901 --> 02:19:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second session did the same</v>

3051
02:19:47.151 --> 02:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>thing and then I did it again yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

3052
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I barely feel that tendinitis now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

3053
02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just getting the inflammation</v>

3054
02:19:56.481 --> 02:19:57.500
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3055
02:19:57.501 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just has an overall effect on</v>

3056
02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:03.500
<v Speaker 1>inflammation throughout your whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3057
02:20:03.501 --> 02:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3058
02:20:04.850 --> 02:20:06.800
<v Speaker 1>You got a spare set onto where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb in today?</v>

3059
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in right after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3060
02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.000
<v Speaker 2>What does this one James?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a personal infrared.</v>

3061
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:19.110
<v Speaker 2>These are like probably 1500 bucks I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3062
02:20:19.111 --> 02:20:23.280
<v Speaker 2>or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just throw it in your house and they</v>

3063
02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:24.210
<v Speaker 2>also make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3064
02:20:24.290 --> 02:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you,</v>

3065
02:20:25.711 --> 02:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lie down in them.</v>

3066
02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have one.</v>

3067
02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I was lie down in it like a suit and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>

3068
02:20:33.211 --> 02:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Zip it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up to your neck.</v>

3069
02:20:34.381 --> 02:20:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's see that one with the blue down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with that lined lying down is keep</v>

3070
02:20:37.351 --> 02:20:38.520
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down.</v>

3071
02:20:38.521 --> 02:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one with the blue.</v>

3072
02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You're your cursor's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3073
02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3074
02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3075
02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:47.740
<v Speaker 2>You climb like gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the old brady bunch of cafes.</v>

3076
02:20:47.741 --> 02:20:50.700
<v Speaker 2>He gets up your body and it's apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good for you.</v>

3077
02:20:50.730 --> 02:20:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look like she looks like the</v>

3078
02:20:53.551 --> 02:20:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Blueberry and Willy Wonka.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's her pussy.</v>

3079
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Pussy pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3080
02:20:57.001 --> 02:20:57.930
<v Speaker 2>It's on fire.</v>

3081
02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:05.090
<v Speaker 1>She's on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks chic.</v>

3082
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I like a nice sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great hot.</v>

3083
02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the steam so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3084
02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's benefits</v>

3085
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:14.210
<v Speaker 1>steam too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real benefit of the sauna is the</v>

3086
02:21:14.211 --> 02:21:17.330
<v Speaker 1>fact that you can get to 176 degrees in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dry heat.</v>

3087
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Your body can tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you got to 176 degrees and steam</v>

3088
02:21:21.921 --> 02:21:23.930
<v Speaker 1>your fucking Nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a burn on fire,</v>

3089
02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:27.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you'd feel the wet because you</v>

3090
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:29.060
<v Speaker 1>basically be poaching yourself.</v>

3091
02:21:29.090 --> 02:21:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend really believes in the steam</v>

3092
02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:35.000
<v Speaker 2>steam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big drinker and he steams every</v>

3093
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.940
<v Speaker 2>morning and it just all comes out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how I've been.</v>

3094
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dying.</v>

3095
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Big drinkers are all just ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>managing the big drinking.</v>

3096
02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got steam it out.</v>

3097
02:21:50.061 --> 02:21:50.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

3098
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I think Sano will probably help more if</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could figure out a way to not.</v>

3099
02:21:54.411 --> 02:21:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably getting some</v>

3100
02:21:56.031 --> 02:22:00.020
<v Speaker 1>benefit from like being in the steam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet sauna would be even better for</v>

3101
02:22:00.021 --> 02:22:01.790
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's again the same thing.</v>

3102
02:22:01.791 --> 02:22:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Reducing inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3103
02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be less puffy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

3104
02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Russians love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five time champion.</v>

3105
02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Timo cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conan had become adept at enduring the</v>

3106
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:19.541
<v Speaker 1>tournament's 110 degrees Celsius.</v>

02:22:46.681 --> 02:22:50.790
<v Speaker 2>going 20 degrees hotter than that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>my nipples were hurting and I was like,</v>

3119
02:22:50.791 --> 02:22:53.820
<v Speaker 2>why my nipple so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why they were so sore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why did you do that watch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cranked it up and then I came in here</v>

3121
02:22:57.691 --> 02:23:01.350
<v Speaker 2>to do my ads and when I did the ads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left it on too long.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but people can't help it.</v>

3155
02:24:47.310 --> 02:24:51.660

<v Speaker 3>they say what they want to be peers.</v>

3168
02:25:28.991 --> 02:25:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Do they want to?</v>

3169
02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I th I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two full sleeves.</v>

3170
02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be a massive hypocrite if I told</v>

3171
02:25:35.591 --> 02:25:37.780
<v Speaker 1>them not to get tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would definitely tell them,</v>

3172
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you really should think about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to keep the skin for</v>

3173
02:25:41.971 --> 02:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>your rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3174
02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:44.500
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3175
02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:46.960
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get a tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should mean something.</v>

3176
02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't get anything done that's cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go real artists.</v>

3177
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3178
02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:25:55.810 --> 02:25:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He can't control them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

3180
02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:58.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

3181
02:25:58.931 --> 02:26:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Not only do I think you can't control</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3182
02:26:00.611 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you try to control them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the opposite.</v>

3183
02:26:03.130 --> 02:26:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Nose piercing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose piercing seems easy.</v>

3184
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:09.760
<v Speaker 1>He'd get it taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it back in.</v>

3185
02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather nose piercing that</v>

3186
02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:16.240
<v Speaker 1>forehead tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so beautiful and feed a loca</v>

3187
02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:18.690
<v Speaker 1>rather than your forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh?</v>

3188
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3189
02:26:21.131 --> 02:26:24.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my younger one was like,</v>

3190
02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I like a little nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3191
02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:26.201
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3192
02:26:26.201 --> 02:26:28.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like the little.in the nose kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3193
02:26:28.601 --> 02:26:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be worse things in this life.</v>

3194
02:26:31.210 --> 02:26:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I doesn't really make me that angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's so perfect just like I get it.</v>

3195
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

3196
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:39.760
<v Speaker 3>People like decorating themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3197
02:26:39.850 --> 02:26:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Then we were buying something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was when we were in New York and</v>

3198
02:26:43.451 --> 02:26:47.230
<v Speaker 3>we're just walking around and then I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>buying something in the woman at the</v>

3199
02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:51.880
<v Speaker 3>register was tons of piercings on her</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose and her ears and like,</v>

3200
02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:54.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50 on her ear.</v>

3201
02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:56.253
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3202
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did the nose one?</v>

3203
02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Did you nose piercing hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is right off our conversation.</v>

3204
02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really did hurt.</v>

3205
02:27:03.491 --> 02:27:06.590
<v Speaker 3>It was so painful and they had to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice and then it got infected and it</v>

3206
02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:07.660
<v Speaker 3>was just a terrible thing.</v>

3207
02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.580
<v Speaker 3>I've got staff and gang grandy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't even my nose anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at my daughter,</v>

3209
02:27:12.911 --> 02:27:15.160
<v Speaker 3>like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see what can happen.</v>

3210
02:27:15.210 --> 02:27:16.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still want it.</v>

3211
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:18.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop them.</v>

3212
02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:21.820
<v Speaker 3>People like decorate and themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a weird thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3298

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3299
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:18.130
<v Speaker 3>It is a weird way of living and I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>nostalgic sometimes because I see,</v>

3300
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I go back that same place,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I was a kid and uh,</v>

3302
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:25.890
<v Speaker 4>and the one hand it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3303
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:28.800
<v Speaker 4>you could have made that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could stay and easy.</v>

3304
02:31:28.890 --> 02:31:33.030
<v Speaker 4>It's just stay there and be at the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot and do the same thing and there's</v>

3305
02:31:33.031 --> 02:31:36.090
<v Speaker 4>something very appealing and calm about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3306
02:31:36.690 --> 02:31:39.360
<v Speaker 4>But it wasn't my nature.</v>

3307
02:31:39.700 --> 02:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3308

<v Speaker 1>something that other people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

<v Speaker 2>with her legs.</v>

3572
02:42:56.970 --> 02:43:00.180
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could have them legs like fully</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh and hence creating an angular pose</v>

3588

<v Speaker 2>and hence that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that girls like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did you ask me to do?</v>

3590
02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:45.633
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3591
02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:49.240
<v Speaker 2>what did you that is not part of my job</v>
<v Speaker 2>description.</v>

3592
02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:54.310
<v Speaker 2>That is not what I was hired for and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>barefoot for fucking some strange</v>

3593
02:43:54.311 --> 02:43:57.010
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm barefoot and angry looking.</v>

3594
02:43:57.011 --> 02:43:58.390
<v Speaker 2>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>White man,</v>

3595
02:43:59.410 --> 02:44:02.620
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading a thing yesterday that had</v>

3596
02:44:02.621 --> 02:44:05.590
<v Speaker 2>sleep patterns of successful people.</v>

3597
02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Branson,</v>

3598
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that,</v>

3599
02:44:12.970 --> 02:44:14.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

3600
02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:17.350
<v Speaker 2>most of them six hours of sleep at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night?</v>

3601
02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most between like the 12 one o'clock to</v>

3602
02:44:21.101 --> 02:44:22.900
<v Speaker 2>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven o'clock in the morning.</v>

3603
02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a balance between</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity and health and if you want</v>

3604
02:44:27.371 --> 02:44:29.140
<v Speaker 2>to get more done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's probably the way to</v>

3605
02:44:29.141 --> 02:44:30.580
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think those people were</v>

3606
02:44:30.581 --> 02:44:35.230
<v Speaker 2>pillars of health for fitness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise is really hard and you know,</v>

3607
02:44:35.231 --> 02:44:38.140
<v Speaker 2>and really tax your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need more.</v>

3608
02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I think you need eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need eight.</v>

3609
02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I do eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do eight?</v>

3610
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I feel way better when I get eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has six is six does not seem like a</v>

3611
02:44:45.521 --> 02:44:48.340
<v Speaker 2>lot cause this all the different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nikola Tesla got to,</v>

3612
02:44:48.610 --> 02:44:49.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's too busy.</v>

02:44:49.331 --> 02:44:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Bang and pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>

3614
02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:54.820
<v Speaker 2>He was banging super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super genius.</v>

3615
02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Who was in love with a pigeon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3616
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never heard that.</v>

3617
02:44:58.151 --> 02:45:01.240
<v Speaker 2>He had a love affair with the pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winston Churchill got like a hundred</v>

3618
02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:03.430
<v Speaker 2>hours of sleep at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Da Vinci and he was just drunk all the</v>

3619
02:45:03.431 --> 02:45:04.780
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are those,</v>

3620
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:07.480
<v Speaker 2>are those dots mean hours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when they slept,</v>

3621
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:10.360
<v Speaker 2>he slept every four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 20 minute nap.</v>

3622
02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Who did something similar to that then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did that.</v>

3623
02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what those little blue lines are</v>

3624
02:45:15.191 --> 02:45:18.730
<v Speaker 2>when they were sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3625
02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:22.360
<v Speaker 2>And Winston Churchill just slept like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear because he was drunk.</v>

3626
02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.300
<v Speaker 2>He drank like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Branson seems like he's getting,</v>

3627
02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:31.210
<v Speaker 2>let's say six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3628
02:45:31.211 --> 02:45:33.430
<v Speaker 2>12 to six that sounds kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

3629
02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:37.360
<v Speaker 2>That's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But six is early to get up for me while</v>

3630
02:45:37.361 --> 02:45:39.730
<v Speaker 2>if he's one of those gets shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>

3631
02:45:39.731 --> 02:45:42.610
<v Speaker 2>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to four,</v>

3632
02:45:42.730 --> 02:45:45.420
<v Speaker 2>one to four come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not real be true.</v>

3633
02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Is that real based on speed one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3634
02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:51.420
<v Speaker 2>that was the speculation about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3635
02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:55.000
<v Speaker 2>from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an article that was posted a while back</v>

3636
02:45:55.001 --> 02:46:00.001
<v Speaker 2>was that he had a prescription for</v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines and like the 90s,</v>

3637
02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:04.530
<v Speaker 2>and someone had prescribed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what you could find that um,</v>

3638
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:09.630
<v Speaker 2>trump prescribed speed for diet and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed</v>

3639
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:12.140
<v Speaker 1>on it for like eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3640
02:46:12.470 --> 02:46:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been my understanding when you talk</v>

3641
02:46:16.071 --> 02:46:19.820
<v Speaker 1>to people that love adderall and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those sorts of things,</v>

3642
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that you become incredibly productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on that stuff.</v>

3643
02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you're one of those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets used to being incredibly productive</v>

3644
02:46:28.010 --> 02:46:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like eliminating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard.</v>

3645
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:33.950
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1993,</v>

3646
02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Harry hunts unauthorized biography on</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

3647
02:46:36.740 --> 02:46:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Last tycoon corroborated the rumors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>went one step further.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The Diet drugs with trump took in pill</v>

3649
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:47.090

<v Speaker 1>but gave him a feeling of euphoria and</v>

3650
02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.910
<v Speaker 1>unlimited energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Medical Literature,</v>

02:46:49.911 --> 02:46:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some potentially dangerous side</v>

3652
02:46:51.861 --> 02:46:53.780
<v Speaker 1>effect could result from long term</v>
<v Speaker 1>usage.</v>

3653
02:46:53.980 --> 02:46:55.790
<v Speaker 1>They included anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insomnia,</v>

3654
02:46:55.791 --> 02:46:57.530
<v Speaker 1>and delusions of grand jury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3655
02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:01.910
<v Speaker 1>According to several trump organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>insiders,</v>

3657
02:47:05.721 --> 02:47:09.650
<v Speaker 1>drug use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some the supposed drug trump</v>

<v Speaker 1>took back then was tenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos Pan a drug with speed like effects.</v>

3659
02:47:15.621 --> 02:47:20.621
<v Speaker 1>It's not unlike dexedrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These rumors say trump stopped seeing</v>

3660
02:47:20.811 --> 02:47:24.380
<v Speaker 1>doctor Greenberg decades ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to one source to our</v>

3661
02:47:24.381 --> 02:47:27.890
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Donald Trump of today is on a diet</v>

3662
02:47:27.891 --> 02:47:32.891
<v Speaker 1>drug called fen term mean and has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>since at least April of 2014 he does not</v>

<v Speaker 1>look like he's on a diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phen phen phen phen phen to mean first</v>

3666
02:47:49.761 --> 02:47:53.270
<v Speaker 1>established anti obesity drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem was that patients</v>

3667
02:47:53.271 --> 02:47:56.570
<v Speaker 1>taking the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b camera b began reporting damage to</v>

3668
02:47:56.571 --> 02:48:00.380
<v Speaker 1>their hearts and lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the combination destroyed</v>

3669
02:48:00.381 --> 02:48:05.381
<v Speaker 1>patients body's ability to regulate the</v>

3671
02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:08.780
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still prescribed and while the US</v>

3672
02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:13.840
<v Speaker 1>National Library of medicine notes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people take phentermine for a month</v>

3673
02:48:13.911 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 1>or so at a time since the drug is</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>

3674
02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.750
<v Speaker 1>trump has supposedly been taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously for over two years.</v>

3675
02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people get used to taking pills and</v>

3676
02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:30.410

<v Speaker 1>they can't.</v>

3678
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just very hard to just go cold</v>

<v Speaker 1>the campaign trail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like constantly speaking against and</v>

3683
02:48:45.261 --> 02:48:47.510
<v Speaker 1>could never shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really impressive.</v>

02:48:50.330 --> 02:48:53.150
<v Speaker 1>72 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>73 but it doesn't it make sense.</v>

3686
02:48:53.210 --> 02:48:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3689
02:48:59.270 --> 02:49:01.550
<v Speaker 1>She was on a pro vigil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3690
02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Pro Vigil is a drug that was first</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented.</v>

3691
02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make a drug that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually</v>

3692
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.490
<v Speaker 2>a performance enhancing drug and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to come up with a reason for</v>

3693
02:49:11.491 --> 02:49:13.650
<v Speaker 2>taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he can't just say,</v>

3694
02:49:13.651 --> 02:49:15.600
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made a pharmaceutical drug that</v>

3695
02:49:15.601 --> 02:49:16.890
<v Speaker 2>enhances your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3696
02:49:16.891 --> 02:49:18.120
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your energy levels.</v>

3697
02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:21.720
<v Speaker 2>So they came up with narcolepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3698
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I've taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3699
02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great if you have to drive</v>

3700
02:49:24.991 --> 02:49:27.270
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and you're tired because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give you,</v>

3701
02:49:27.271 --> 02:49:29.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you speedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it makes you any</v>

3702
02:49:29.971 --> 02:49:32.130
<v Speaker 2>smarter or faster thinking or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3703
02:49:32.131 --> 02:49:35.610
<v Speaker 2>But it definitely keeps you awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you like a little elevated</v>

3704
02:49:35.611 --> 02:49:37.460
<v Speaker 2>sense of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3705
02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.480
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

3706
02:49:38.481 --> 02:49:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'd have to take something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep up those.</v>

3707
02:49:40.321 --> 02:49:41.154
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

02:49:49.890 --> 02:49:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then get skinnier.</v>

02:53:40.761 --> 02:53:45.761
<v Speaker 2>It was like some crazy story where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was on Ambien and he drove to someone's</v>

3806
02:53:45.891 --> 02:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>house and killed him with a crowbar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then drove home.</v>

3807
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:51.620
<v Speaker 2>We had no idea even did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3808

3809
02:53:54.621 --> 02:53:57.620
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can never predict exactly how</v>

3810

<v Speaker 2>someone's going to react to like heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>duty pharmaceutic.</v>

3872
02:57:16.521 --> 02:57:18.140
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just screaming and crying.</v>

3873
02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:19.033
<v Speaker 3>Woe</v>

3876
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I did have recurring nightmares that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the one very clear one was um,</v>

3877
02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:32.120
<v Speaker 3>it was a blackness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3878
02:57:32.121 --> 02:57:35.660
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when you're sleeping and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel the,</v>

3879
02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:36.560
<v Speaker 3>the black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3880
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the space was just very big and you felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small in it.</v>

3881
02:57:41.310 --> 02:57:43.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be rumbling real mum,</v>

3882
02:57:43.761 --> 02:57:44.220
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>

3883
02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:44.751
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>

3884
02:57:44.751 --> 02:57:45.261
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>

3885
02:57:45.261 --> 02:57:45.721
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>

3886
02:57:45.721 --> 02:57:46.231
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mum,</v>

3887
02:57:46.231 --> 02:57:48.140
<v Speaker 2>mum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would build on the momentum</v>

3888
02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:50.750
<v Speaker 2>recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>

3889
02:57:50.780 --> 02:57:51.261
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>

3890
02:57:51.261 --> 02:57:51.741
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>

3891
02:57:51.741 --> 02:57:52.574
<v Speaker 2>bum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bum bum.</v>

3892
02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:57.820
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would feel kind of pulled back a</v>

3893
02:57:57.821 --> 02:58:01.590
<v Speaker 3>little bit and it got a silent okay.</v>

3894
02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:07.320
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the terrorists have two tanks</v>

3895
02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:12.210
<v Speaker 4>would slowly come into the periphery on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the left and the right of a mum,</v>

3896
02:58:12.211 --> 02:58:12.730
<v Speaker 4>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mum,</v>

3897
02:58:12.730 --> 02:58:13.141
<v Speaker 4>mum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mum,</v>

3898
02:58:13.141 --> 02:58:14.730
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see like the governor of the</v>

3899
02:58:14.731 --> 02:58:19.731
<v Speaker 4>tank and the tanks would slowly start</v>
<v Speaker 4>going towards each other from the left</v>

3900
02:58:20.461 --> 02:58:24.840
<v Speaker 4>and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they would fall down this hole</v>

3901
02:58:25.650 --> 02:58:30.090
<v Speaker 4>and you'd get that feeling of falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes I'd see the face of</v>

3902
02:58:30.091 --> 02:58:30.190
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3903
02:58:30.190 --> 02:58:35.190
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I have dreams of falling off</v>

3904
02:58:35.651 --> 02:58:36.710
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3905
02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:39.160
<v Speaker 2>What's that supposed to mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that you're going to get</v>

3906
02:58:39.161 --> 02:58:41.530
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful.</v>

3907
02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I do though.</v>

3908
02:58:50.141 --> 02:58:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I have dreams where I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 2>catching myself like I'm on a tree.</v>

3909
02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:56.140
<v Speaker 2>This tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on.</v>

3910
02:58:56.410 --> 02:58:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing on the edge of this</v>

3911
02:58:58.001 --> 02:58:59.920
<v Speaker 2>building?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing on that cliff?</v>

3912
02:59:00.350 --> 02:59:03.100
<v Speaker 2>You get back to the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get back to the same spot.</v>

3913
02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:05.940
<v Speaker 4>So I wouldn't connect the dream to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep walking,</v>

3914
02:59:05.941 --> 02:59:07.680
<v Speaker 4>but what do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3915
02:59:07.681 --> 02:59:09.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could have been connected.</v>

3916
02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:10.013
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a doctor.</v>

3917
02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:13.140
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time I was at my friends</v>

3918
02:59:13.141 --> 02:59:15.750
<v Speaker 4>sleeping over my friend's house and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next morning they were like,</v>

3919
02:59:16.530 --> 02:59:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Tommy can't sleep here anymore because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it at their house where they just</v>

3920
02:59:21.181 --> 02:59:24.090
<v Speaker 4>asleep and then you got some kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming in the middle of screaming in</v>

3921
02:59:24.091 --> 02:59:27.480
<v Speaker 4>the middle of then crying and screaming</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of the living room.</v>

3922
02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I've had kids do that at my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3925

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3927
02:59:38.731 --> 02:59:41.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't have kids to understand</v>

3928
02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:42.690
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

3929
02:59:42.690 --> 02:59:44.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when I,</v>

3930
02:59:44.251 --> 02:59:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was on planes before I would</v>

3931
02:59:46.801 --> 02:59:51.000
<v Speaker 2>be bummed out if a kid was crying was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>

3932
02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:54.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fun fucking loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid kid.</v>

3933
02:59:54.061 --> 02:59:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Quiet your kid up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3934
02:59:55.680 --> 02:59:57.270
<v Speaker 2>But now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aww,</v>

3935
02:59:57.300 --> 02:59:58.410
<v Speaker 2>poor little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3936
02:59:58.411 --> 03:00:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't it that you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear it,</v>

3937
03:00:00.751 --> 03:00:02.940
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3938
03:00:03.010 --> 03:00:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep.</v>

3939
03:00:05.851 --> 03:00:07.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3940
03:00:07.951 --> 03:00:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Once you hit so different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you have it</v>

3941
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:11.300
<v Speaker 4>hopefully and the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3942
03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:12.071
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3943
03:00:12.071 --> 03:00:13.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have empathy for the parents.</v>

3944
03:00:13.531 --> 03:00:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3945
03:00:14.791 --> 03:00:18.390
<v Speaker 4>I've been there when you're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>through that thing is just so rough and</v>

3946
03:00:18.391 --> 03:00:20.120
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it really is an instinct.</v>

3947
03:00:20.121 --> 03:00:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Like there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no,</v>

3948
03:00:22.530 --> 03:00:23.960
<v Speaker 4>like when you hear a baby crying and</v>
<v Speaker 4>plain,</v>

3949
03:00:23.970 --> 03:00:25.560
<v Speaker 4>there's not that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you had,</v>

3950
03:00:25.561 --> 03:00:27.900
<v Speaker 4>when you were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just like get it Outta here.</v>

3951
03:00:28.210 --> 03:00:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing that people do</v>

3952
03:00:29.981 --> 03:00:30.671
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3953
03:00:30.671 --> 03:00:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it before were like young boys</v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular do not like babies.</v>

3954
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like kids.</v>

3955
03:00:37.330 --> 03:00:38.410
<v Speaker 2>And they're around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3956
03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll roll their eyes and it's like to</v>

3957
03:00:41.531 --> 03:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>them instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3958
03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:45.490
<v Speaker 2>And then once you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would just like,</v>

3959
03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny when you see like teenage</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys around them,</v>

3960
03:00:49.480 --> 03:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>especially ones that haven't been raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>around kids.</v>

3961
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the instinct that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to,</v>

3962
03:00:53.871 --> 03:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day take care of one of those.</v>

3963
03:00:55.601 --> 03:00:56.434
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3964
03:00:56.520 --> 03:00:58.090
<v Speaker 2>And the party is going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to track,</v>

3965
03:00:58.120 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 2>be trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The part is going</v>

3966
03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>to end in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because like there are these</v>

3967
03:01:02.441 --> 03:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is all coming full circle</v>

3968
03:01:05.021 --> 03:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>to what we're talking about with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson on a boat,</v>

3969
03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>getting his dick sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing coke.</v>

3970
03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

3971
03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you hang in there long enough</v>

3972
03:01:18.731 --> 03:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>becomes cool again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're hammered and you're 20</v>

3973
03:01:21.701 --> 03:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>and you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it a party,</v>

3974
03:01:22.661 --> 03:01:27.661
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of silly and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're hammered and you're 60,</v>

3975
03:01:27.671 --> 03:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3976
03:01:29.230 --> 03:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you're hammered and your 90 it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny again.</v>

3977
03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3978
03:01:33.341 --> 03:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3979
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you're a 90 year old drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I goddamn about you all just suck my</v>

3981
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>apparently the latest in the sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment Olympics,</v>

3982
03:01:46.270 --> 03:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>the latest a entry is Stan Lee from</v>
<v Speaker 1>marvel comics.</v>

3985
03:01:53.770 --> 03:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>He lives in some giant mansion and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a bunch of nurses and he's trying to</v>

3986
03:01:57.251 --> 03:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>get them all the blown.</v>

3987
03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Of course now he says it's a shake down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says they're all,</v>

3988
03:02:02.410 --> 03:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>they're all just trying to get money</v>
<v Speaker 1>from him.</v>

3989
03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may very well be the case.</v>

3990
03:02:06.851 --> 03:02:11.851
<v Speaker 1>She or it may well very well be the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is like a lot of 95 year old</v>

3996
03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>if he really can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I mean.</v>

3997
03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.800
<v Speaker 1>If you're worth what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

3998
03:02:32.830 --> 03:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say now?</v>

3999
03:02:34.770 --> 03:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4000
03:02:35.980 --> 03:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>He bought someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was revealed that someone had</v>

4001
03:02:39.221 --> 03:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>bought an $850,000 condo in his name</v>
<v Speaker 1>without his knowledge.</v>

4002
03:02:42.430 --> 03:02:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And that was last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're at oh no.</v>

4003
03:02:44.621 --> 03:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow police report after discovering</v>

4004
03:02:47.291 --> 03:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that someone had stolen $300,000 from</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

4005
03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using a forged check and then it was a</v>

4006
03:02:52.831 --> 03:02:57.831
<v Speaker 1>reveal that someone bought an $850,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>condo in his name without his knowledge</v>

4007
03:02:58.271 --> 03:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came to light when his team did a</v>

4008
03:03:00.791 --> 03:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>full audit of his accounts following the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forged check.</v>

4009
03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Whether this is any way related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4010
03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So he might be being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be in reaction to shake down</v>

4011
03:03:13.310 --> 03:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>the shakedown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy has so much money that</v>

4012
03:03:17.531 --> 03:03:22.531
<v Speaker 1>someone bought an $850,000 condo in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>name and he didn't learn about it until</v>

4013
03:03:23.051 --> 03:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>they were going over the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4014
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:26.111
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4015
03:03:26.111 --> 03:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>He didn't learn about it until they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found a $300,000 stolen cheque.</v>

4016
03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a baller.</v>

4017
03:03:31.090 --> 03:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4020
03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:45.960

<v Speaker 1>who's trying to tell these maids to suck</v>

4021
03:03:46.091 --> 03:03:47.080

<v Speaker 1>I like to think that.</v>

4023
