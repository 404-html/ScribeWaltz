00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the people create that?</v>

2
00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the big a,</v>

3
00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>the big hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new age.</v>

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>A argument about lives that you create</v>
<v Speaker 1>these possibilities in life,</v>

5
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for all these</v>

6
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>different events that are happening too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not random events.</v>

7
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>These are events that are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>created by your own intentions.</v>

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that sometimes,</v>

9
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I learned was that till you</v>

10
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't gonna move forward.</v>

11
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>There's mother fuckers that get off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

12
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:33.341

<v Speaker 1>Audio sucks the sound that I watched a</v>

13
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>guy eat the pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck ate shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything else.</v>

16
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And until you come through that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really,</v>

17
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>and that was big for me that I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

18
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen,</v>

19
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go home,</v>

20
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I put my feet up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch the news and I go to bed like</v>

21
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

22
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago I didn't go to bed late.</v>

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to shut my window a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and close my door,</v>

24
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>shut away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I couldn't leave the light on at</v>

25
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>night because I owed money to a drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealer like rob somebody.</v>

26
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I created all those scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

27
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make that kidnapping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there with a gun.</v>

28
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew that was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny that quick,</v>

29
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>the turnaround was between like 99 you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

30
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all just sort of stopped and also</v>

31
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>luggage and it kept stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>it kept stopping and kept getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>What you're telling me is that I never</v>
<v Speaker 1>did blog at after 2006 that's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's you're trying to tell me to say</v>

35
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest way to phrase that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Christian man who was living on the</v>

131
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>wrong side of the law and Jesus at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time and then turned it all</v>

<v Speaker 1>time sucked a dick and liked it way too</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're all liquored up on moonshine and</v>

140
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>coats and ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>out in the out in the fucking house</v>
<v Speaker 1>swaps,</v>

143
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:20.241
<v Speaker 1>he saw to call it a duck blind combined</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and shame mixed inside of me.</v>

144
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to kill ducks from now on</v>

145
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>and never think about this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't see shit.</v>

146
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Your Mother didn't see shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your father didn't see shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm good to few magic.</v>

148
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.150
