00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And also it's like try getting really high on a really good weed and start</v>

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>thinking about those fucking drones zooming around Afghanistan and blast and</v>

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>missiles at kids and it's like you'll really start getting a clear understanding</v>

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>of how fucked up that is.</v>

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>no matter what even let's say even those drone attacks we had to do them,</v>

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>it's still fucked up.</v>

9
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It still creates more of a sensitivity towards,</v>

10
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>people getting their limbs blown off of their bodies,</v>

12
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>in the pursuit of some ridiculous war.</v>

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of,</v>

15
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>that's hitting the military industrial complex.</v>

17
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's hitting the pharmaceutical companies because if you start getting high,</v>

18
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start experiencing a,</v>

19
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>a better level of happiness.</v>

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make you start dealing with your bullshit.</v>

21
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it'll make you depressed because you're lazy,</v>

22
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>

23
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>it won't allow you to like sink into the kind of sedated hypnosis that it seems</v>

24
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>like that works really fucking well for Applebee's.</v>

25
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>it works really well for the corporations,</v>

27
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:08.001
<v Speaker 1>for people to be in a sedated hypnotic state where they can really make sense of</v>

28
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>going down to a shopping mall and and like eating at a fucking,</v>

29
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

30
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>chicken place with their,</v>

31
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>with their kids and then going up and buying some shit.</v>

32
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a shoe store and then spending their day just consuming shit they don't</v>

33
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>really need and then going home and sitting back to watch TV with more</v>

34
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>advertisements and not thinking that's weird and falling asleep and that kind of</v>

35
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>depress lumber that is really hard to do if you're high,</v>

36
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're really high,</v>

37
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to watch normal TV and not be like,</v>

38
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible.</v>

39
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at these advertisements.</v>

40
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:45.654
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>

41
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>They think that that that's going to work on me.</v>

42
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

43
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>$48,000 for a fucking car you're going to pay for.</v>

44
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That's like over a year's wage.</v>

45
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>For some people you're going to make sense of buying a brand new car payments of</v>

46
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>$285 a month.</v>

47
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>When you for like four grand,</v>

48
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>you can go buy a fucking car,</v>

49
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>get it fixed up through the year and have like a shitload extra money and not be</v>

50
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>in debt.</v>

51
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what pot makes you think.</v>

52
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

53
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but if you're like drunk and you're fucking scratching your balls and watching</v>

55
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the game and a fucking the new Lexus,</v>

56
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you'll start thinking like,</v>

57
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:21.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>my credit score went up this year.</v>

59
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I might be able to take out a loan from the bank and get a new Lexus.</v>

60
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're fucking broke and living in hell and it's going to just</v>

61
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>create this weight on your budget that's going to make you miserable.</v>

62
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

63
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to go on a long rant,</v>

64
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>but did I ever tell you the time a friend of mine picked me up and his fucking</v>

65
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes and took me to his apartment.</v>

66
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>They would tell you this.</v>

67
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

68
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You had a brand new Mercedes and I know this guy knew what his job was picking</v>

69
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>me up in his and I knew he can afford a Mercedes.</v>

70
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Picks me up in his brand new Mercedes and he's like,</v>

71
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.061
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

72
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop by my apartment.</v>

73
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Come inside for a second,</v>

74
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>go into his apartment.</v>

75
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>It is a size of a fucking closet.</v>

76
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It is the smallest I've ever seen in my life.</v>

77
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Like barely could eat like he had to like kind of like almost like walk sideways</v>

78
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>against the wall to get around the bed to get to the bathroom.</v>

79
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like a New York style just shit box.</v>

80
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile that guy's car payments have gotta be like five 5,600 a month.</v>

81
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a nice fucking Mercedes and in his mind he had like his logic</v>

82
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>behind it was like yeah it's better to have like a really nice car then like a</v>

83
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>comfortable living situation.</v>

84
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this like a d one last thing.</v>

85
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a tramp Daemon cause why?</v>

86
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a tramp demon because Trump see that Mercedes and they're like let's</v>

87
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>go back to your apartment cause they think he's rich and then they get in this</v>

88
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>tiny little fucking shitty closet space.</v>

89
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>We have some rap about that.</v>

90
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>They're making my new place or fixing up town.</v>

91
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm staying here for a little while.</v>

92
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>So fucking set the look on those Trump's face when they walk in that door and</v>

94
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>realize that they barely room to stand.</v>

95
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>There's like two feet of carpet between the door and the bed.</v>

96
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people who believe in those really small sustainable houses.</v>

97
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>that people are making these like really,</v>

99
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>really little houses and you like move things out for the kitchen and move</v>

100
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>things up in the bed is like a little scenario and you know,</v>

101
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.131
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

102
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

103
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like a whole trend on the internet.</v>

104
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people who are doing that and that's cool.</v>

105
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong about living simply.</v>

106
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just hilarious when people,</v>

107
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

109
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

110
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>they throw themselves into a hellish debt,</v>

111
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>for a symbol and,</v>

113
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.801
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:29.191
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

115
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that,</v>

116
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.431
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

117
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:30.731
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

118
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

119
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.341
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

120
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

121
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you enjoy the fuck out of a nice car.</v>

122
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You get an a Mercedes.</v>

123
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe you're allowed to drive this thing.</v>

124
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>

125
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>people look at you like you must be special looking at,</v>

126
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>he's getting into that Mercedes.</v>

127
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:40.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

128
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:41.351
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

129
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people that is a tangible benefit of having a car like that they</v>

130
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>liked this quarter.</v>

131
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's shallow all day,</v>

132
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>but men driving one of those things is beautiful.</v>

133
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing piece of engineering and as a a year head,</v>

134
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm sort of a minor league area because I don't know exactly how all</v>

135
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

136
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>But like Adam Corollas,</v>

138
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>like a legit gearhead and he can like build cars.</v>

139
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I just like buy them from people who know how to build them and they appreciate</v>

140
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.251
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out of him.</v>

141
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I think they're interesting.</v>

142
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>But the driving one you've drive like a really well engineered piece of,</v>

143
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.053
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing,</v>

144
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

145
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.021
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

146
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>if I had shit shitloads of money,</v>

147
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I would buy a nice car and I wouldn't feel weird about it.</v>

148
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:24.121
<v Speaker 1>Cause anything to like to to dull the fucking existential harder that comes over</v>

149
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>me on the one oh one and traffic.</v>

150
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

151
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying when those commercials,</v>

152
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.643
<v Speaker 1>you know they're are,</v>

153
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>they're not just appealing to rich people,</v>

154
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

155
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

156
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>they're manipulating eds into somehow convincing them that logically makes sense</v>

157
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>to get in debt to a bank for 50 grand.</v>

158
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not just idiots.</v>

159
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It's people that are not happy.</v>

160
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're offering you happiness.</v>

161
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

162
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>most people throughout their day,</v>

163
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>they have a job that can occasionally be interesting,</v>

164
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but they would never fucking do for free.</v>

165
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And whether they're good at or not,</v>

166
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it takes some sense of pride in their work.</v>

167
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.424
<v Speaker 1>They get through their day,</v>

168
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking tired,</v>

169
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:03.171
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

170
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And people were unsatisfied.</v>

171
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they worked so fucking hard.</v>

172
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>They put so much and what am I getting?</v>

173
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just existing.</v>

174
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm doing.</v>

175
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.554
<v Speaker 1>I'm existing.</v>

176
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>

177
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>They get fucking shit.</v>

178
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They buy a new bowling ball.</v>

179
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.534
<v Speaker 1>They get a new,</v>

180
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>they get a new Lexus and no one for them.</v>

181
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:20.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>for some of them you say it's sad,</v>

183
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>but for some of those guys that are stuck in that life,</v>

184
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>no matter what they do,</v>

185
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>that might prevent that might give them like a little bit more happiness</v>

186
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.600
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>

187
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188

191
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:36.651
<v Speaker 1>Don't start.</v>

192
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>You're starting at the top start way deep.</v>

193
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Start down deep and then worry about the fucking Mercedes and yes for you.</v>

194
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

195
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

196
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.351
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

197
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>for a guy who thinks,</v>

198
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>but for someone who's just locked into the life of a drone and accepts it and</v>

199
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Nice Little Red Mercedes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

201
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.060

202
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.321
<v Speaker 1>He's so happy.</v>

203
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets into his red Mercedes.</v>

208
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.380
